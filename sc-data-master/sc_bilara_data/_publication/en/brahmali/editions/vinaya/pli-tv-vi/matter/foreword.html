<p>Ajahn Brahmal’s translation of the Pali Vinaya Piṭaka is the culmination of work that began in 2013 as a revision of the standard translation by I.B. Horner for the Pali Text Society. As these things go, he rapidly found that more revisions were required, and the project became a new translation independent of Horner’s.</p>
<p>I have been honored to support Ven. Brahmali through this process as I was meanwhile developing my Sutta translations. We have discussed points of translation on many occasions, but the reader should be aware that this is a distinct work of his. We have not attempted to make the translations consistent, as there are only a few passages that directly overlap. I have, however, adopted Brahmali’s renderings for most Vinaya terms on the few occasions they appear in the Suttas.</p>
<p>Details aside, one of the great advantages Brahmali brings to his work is the wisdom of experience. He has lived and practiced for many years in a community that lives by the Vinaya. This brings a whole wealth of perspective and clarity to his work, as issues that are debated theoretically in academic circles are a part of daily life in a community. Through this whole process, he has been deeply contemplating the meaning of the Pali text and its expression in English, creating a living document that speaks to both letter and spirit.</p>
<p>Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and publishing our translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations available as books in various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.</p>
<p>Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made available in the highest quality without compromise.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing restrictions. </p>
