<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone306' href='#cone306' data-uid='pdhp306'>Cone 306</a>The one who has an exceeding lack of virtue,<br>
like a deadly creeper covering a Sal tree,<br>
makes himself the same as his enemy wishes him to be.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone307' href='#cone307' data-uid='pdhp307'>Cone 307</a>That wickedness done by oneself,<br>
born in oneself, arising in oneself,<br>
crushes the one who is stupid,<br>
as a diamond crushes a rock-jewel.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone308' href='#cone308' data-uid='pdhp308'>Cone 308</a>By oneself alone is a wicked deed done,<br>
by oneself is one defiled,<br>
by oneself is a wicked deed left undone,<br>
by oneself is one purified,<br>
purity and impurity come from oneself,<br>
for no one purify another.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone309' href='#cone309' data-uid='pdhp309'>Cone 309</a> Not the wrongs of others,<br>
or what others have done or have not done one should consider,<br>
but what has been done and not done by oneself.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone310' href='#cone310' data-uid='pdhp310'>Cone 310</a>Not the wrongs of others,<br>
or what is just and unjust for others one should consider,<br>
but what is just and unjust for oneself.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone311' href='#cone311' data-uid='pdhp311'>Cone 311</a>If one regards oneself as dear one should guard oneself right well,<br>
for happiness is not easy to gain by those who do wrong.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone312' href='#cone312' data-uid='pdhp312'>Cone 312</a>If one regards oneself as dear one should guard oneself right well,<br>
during one of the three watches of the night<br>
the wise one should stay alert.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone313' href='#cone313' data-uid='pdhp313'>Cone 313</a>Sitting alone, lying down alone,<br>
walking alone, diligent,<br>
the solitary one who delights in himself<br>
will delight in the edge of a forest.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone314' href='#cone314' data-uid='pdhp314'>Cone 314</a>Whoever reviles the worthy teaching<br>
of the Noble Ones who live by Dhamma,<br>
that stupid one, depending on wicked views,<br>
makes himself the same as his enemy wishes him to be.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone315' href='#cone315' data-uid='pdhp315'>Cone 315</a>Whoever reviles the worthy teaching<br>
of the Noble Ones who live by Dhamma,<br>
that stupid one, depending on wicked views,<br>
like the bamboo when it bears fruit, brings about his own destruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone316' href='#cone316' data-uid='pdhp316'>Cone 316</a>First one should establish oneself in the good and the Dhamma,<br>
then one can advise another,<br>
saying: ‘You must be as I am’.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone317' href='#cone317' data-uid='pdhp317'>Cone 317</a>First one should commit oneself to what is suitable,<br>
then when advising another,<br>
the wise one should not have any defilement.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone318' href='#cone318' data-uid='pdhp318'>Cone 318</a>He should do himself as he would advise another to do,<br>
being untrained, he should surely train himself,<br>
for it is said the self is difficult to train.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone319-320' href='#cone319-320' data-uid='pdhp319-320'>Cone 319-320</a>A tamed self is better than that of other people,<br>
for the person who conquers himself,<br>
who lives always well-restrained,<br>
neither gods, nor gandhabbas,<br>
nor Māra together with Brahmās,<br>
can turn conquest into defeat for a person who is like this.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone321' href='#cone321' data-uid='pdhp321'>Cone 321</a>For the self is the friend of self,<br>
for what other friend would there be?<br>
When the self is well-practiced,<br>
one finds a friend that is hard to find.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone322' href='#cone322' data-uid='pdhp322'>Cone 322</a>Self is the protector of self,<br>
self is the refuge of self,<br>
therefore one should restrain oneself,<br>
as a merchant restrains his noble horse.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone323' href='#cone323' data-uid='pdhp323'>Cone 323</a>One should tame oneself always,<br>
that will be for a good destiny,<br>
be tamed, be peaceful, be upright,<br>
and from that be honest,<br>
then, tamed, be happy,<br>
unattached and cooled down.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone324' href='#cone324' data-uid='pdhp324'>Cone 324</a>By oneself one should censure self,<br>
by oneself one should be controlled,<br>
he who guards himself, mindful,<br>
will live happily, monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone325' href='#cone325' data-uid='pdhp325'>Cone 325</a>One should not neglect one’s own good for another’s, however great;<br>
knowing further what is good for oneself<br>
should be the supreme good.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone326' href='#cone326' data-uid='pdhp326'>Cone 326</a>Not for one’s own sake and not for another’s sake,<br>
not desiring heaven, riches, or a kingdom—<br>
he should not desire his success through corruption;<br>
he should be both virtuous and wise and righteous.</p>
