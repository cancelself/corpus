difficult to guard, difficult to ward,<br>
the sagacious one makes straight,<br>
as a fletcher does his arrows.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone343' href='#cone343' data-uid='pdhp343'>Cone 343</a>Like a fish thrown up on dry land,<br>
pulled out from its watery home,<br>
the mind is agitated,<br>
one ought to throw off the sway of Māra.</p>

is lonesome, without a body, hidden,<br>
gain release from the bonds of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone345' href='#cone345' data-uid='pdhp345'>Cone 345</a>For the mind that is difficult to subdue, flighty,<br>
flitting wherever it will,<br>
restraint is good,<br>
a restrained mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone346' href='#cone346' data-uid='pdhp346'>Cone 346</a>Hard to see, very subtle,<br>
flitting wherever it will,<br>
the sage should guard the mind,<br>
for guarded it brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone347' href='#cone347' data-uid='pdhp347'>Cone 347</a>For the one with mind that is not dependent,<br>
for the one with mind unperplexed,<br>
having abandoned the wholesome and demerit,<br>
for the watchful, there is no fear.</p>

Dhamma drink, with a clear mind,<br>
the wise one will always delight<br>
in the Dhamma that is made known by the Noble.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone349' href='#cone349' data-uid='pdhp349'>Cone 349</a>Before long has passed by, alas, this body will lie on the ground,<br>
rejected, without consciousness,<br>
just like a useless piece of wood.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone350' href='#cone350' data-uid='pdhp350'>Cone 350</a>Knowing this body is frail like a jar,<br>
govern the mind like a fortress,<br>
one should fight Māra with the weapon of wisdom,<br>
guard your success, and do not be attached.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone351' href='#cone351' data-uid='pdhp351'>Cone 351</a>Just as the rain penetrates a house with thatching that is poor,<br>
so passion penetrates a mind that is undeveloped.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone352' href='#cone352' data-uid='pdhp352'>Cone 352</a>Just as rain does not penetrate a house with thatching that is good,<br>
