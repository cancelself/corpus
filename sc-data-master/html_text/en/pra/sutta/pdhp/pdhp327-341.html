<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone327' href='#cone327' data-uid='pdhp327'>Cone 327</a>The people give according to faith,<br>
according to their confidence,<br>
herein the one who becomes depressed<br>
because of food and drink given to others,<br>
does not, either by day or night,<br>
attain to good concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone328' href='#cone328' data-uid='pdhp328'>Cone 328</a>For the one in whom this depression is cut off,<br>
destroyed at the root, dug up,<br>
does, by day and night,<br>
attain to good concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone329' href='#cone329' data-uid='pdhp329'>Cone 329</a>Like a good horse touched by the whip,<br>
living ardent and spiritually intense.<br>
Having faith, virtue and energy,<br>
concentration and insight into the Dhamma,<br>
well-established in patience, meekness and concentration,<br>
they have come to the essence of wisdom and learning.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone330' href='#cone330' data-uid='pdhp330'>Cone 330</a>He who acquires faith and wisdom unsurpassed in this very life,<br>
has great wealth in the world,<br>
other wealth, though great, is useless.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone331' href='#cone331' data-uid='pdhp331'>Cone 331</a>The faithful one who is possessed of virtue,<br>
and has wealth and fame,<br>
whatever district he resorts to,<br>
right there and then he is worshipped.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone332' href='#cone332' data-uid='pdhp332'>Cone 332</a>Faith is a person’s travelling companion,<br>
he would not accept travelling without faith,<br>
from that there will be fame and renown for him,<br>
and when he abandons the body he goes to heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone333' href='#cone333' data-uid='pdhp333'>Cone 333</a>The person who is beyond mere faith,<br>
who knows that which is unmade,<br>
who has cut off rebirth-linking,<br>
who has destroyed the occasion,<br>
who has thrown out hope and desire,<br>
is surely the person supreme.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone334' href='#cone334' data-uid='pdhp334'>Cone 334</a>It is rare the arising of Buddhas,<br>
rare the teaching of the Dhamma,<br>
it is rare to acquire faith,<br>
rare is the life of mortals.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone335' href='#cone335' data-uid='pdhp335'>Cone 335</a>For the one with unsettled mind,<br>
who does not know the True Dhamma,<br>
whose confidence is wavering,<br>
wisdom is unfulfilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone336' href='#cone336' data-uid='pdhp336'>Cone 336</a>For one who has a mind lacking confidence,<br>
that is base or agitated,<br>
and frequently impetuous,<br>
it is not possible to understand the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone337' href='#cone337' data-uid='pdhp337'>Cone 337</a>He who has removed impetuosity,<br>
displeasure from his mind,<br>
with confident mind, happy,<br>
he can understand well-spoken words.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone338' href='#cone338' data-uid='pdhp338'>Cone 338</a>Acquiring birth as a human,<br>
or going to the heavens,<br>
or having sole sovereignty over the earth—<br>
better is the fruit of stream-entry.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone339-340' href='#cone339-340' data-uid='pdhp339-340'>Cone 339-340</a>He whose faith in the Realised One<br>
is well-established and unmoveable,<br>
whose virtue is beautiful,<br>
praised by the noble ones,<br>
who has confidence in the Saṅgha,<br>
who sees uprightly,<br>
he they say is ‘not poor’,<br>
his life is not in vain.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone341' href='#cone341' data-uid='pdhp341'>Cone 341</a>Therefore with faith, virtue, confidence and insight into Dhamma,<br>
a sage should devote himself to the essence of the Buddhas’ dispensation.</p>
