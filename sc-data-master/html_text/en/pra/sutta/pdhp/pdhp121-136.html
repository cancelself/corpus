<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone121' href='#cone121' data-uid='pdhp121'>Cone 121</a>The fragrance of flowers goes not against the wind,<br>
nor does sandalwood or pinwheel or saffron,<br>
<br>
but the fragrance of the good goes against the wind,<br>
the true person’s fragrance permeates all directions.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone122' href='#cone122' data-uid='pdhp122'>Cone 122</a>Sandalwood, pinwheel,<br>
then water lily and striped jasmine,<br>
amongst these kinds of fragrance<br>
virtue’s fragrance is unsurpassed.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone123' href='#cone123' data-uid='pdhp123'>Cone 123</a>Pinwheel and sandalwood fragrance are insignificant,<br>
but the fragrance of those who have virtue<br>
flutters supreme amongst the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone124' href='#cone124' data-uid='pdhp124'>Cone 124</a>Māra cannot find the path of those endowed with virtue,<br>
who live heedfully,<br>
and who are freed through right and deep knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone125' href='#cone125' data-uid='pdhp125'>Cone 125</a>Just like a beautiful flower,<br>
which has colour, but lacks fragrance,<br>
so are well-spoken words fruitless<br>
for the one who acts not on them.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone126' href='#cone126' data-uid='pdhp126'>Cone 126</a>Just like a beautiful flower,<br>
which has colour, and has fragrance,<br>
so are well-spoken words fruitful<br>
for the one who does act on them.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone127' href='#cone127' data-uid='pdhp127'>Cone 127</a>Just as a bee, without hurting the flower, its colour or scent,<br>
gathers its nectar and escapes,<br>
so should the seer roam in the village.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone128' href='#cone128' data-uid='pdhp128'>Cone 128</a>Death takes up and carries away<br>
the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,<br>
like a great flood carries off a sleeping village.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone129' href='#cone129' data-uid='pdhp129'>Cone 129</a>The End-Maker takes control of<br>
the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,<br>
though he is unfulfilled with sense pleasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone130' href='#cone130' data-uid='pdhp130'>Cone 130</a>Just as from a heap of flowers one might make a lot of garlands,<br>
so should many good deeds be done by one who is born a mortal.</p>

together with the gods?<br>
Who will win the well-taught verses of Dhamma<br>
as a good man wins a flower?</p>

together with the gods.<br>
He will win the well-taught verses of Dhamma<br>
as a good man wins a flower.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone133' href='#cone133' data-uid='pdhp133'>Cone 133</a>Just as striped jasmine casts off its (…) flowers,<br>
so, monastics, cast off all passion and hatred.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone134' href='#cone134' data-uid='pdhp134'>Cone 134</a>Knowing that this world is just like froth,<br>
it has the nature of a mirage to those who understand,<br>
cutting off Māra’s flower-tipped arrows,<br>
one should go beyond the King of Death’s sight.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone135-136' href='#cone135-136' data-uid='pdhp135-136'>Cone 135-136</a>Just as in a forsaken rubbish heap along the highway<br>
a lotus might spring forth,<br>
with a pure fragrance, delighting the mind,<br>
so amongst the forsaken,<br>
the Perfect Sambuddha’s disciple<br>
outshines the blind and ordinary folk through his wisdom.</p>
