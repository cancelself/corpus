<blockquote class='gatta'>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone239' href='#cone239' data-uid='pdhp239'>Cone 239</a>Enduring patience is the supreme austerity,<br>
Nibbāna is supreme say the Buddhas,<br>
for one gone forth does not hurt another,<br>
nor does an ascetic harass another.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone240' href='#cone240' data-uid='pdhp240'>Cone 240</a>Those sages without violence,<br>
constantly restrained in body,<br>
go to the deathless Nibbāna,<br>
having gone there they do not grieve.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone241' href='#cone241' data-uid='pdhp241'>Cone 241</a>Gotama’s disciples always awake to a good wakening,<br>
those who day and night have a mind that delights in non-violence.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone242' href='#cone242' data-uid='pdhp242'>Cone 242</a>Gotama’s disciples always awake to a good wakening,<br>
those who day and night have a mind that delights in cultivation.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone243' href='#cone243' data-uid='pdhp243'>Cone 243</a>Gotama’s disciples always awake to a good wakening,<br>
those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone244' href='#cone244' data-uid='pdhp244'>Cone 244</a>Those wise ones intent on meditation,<br>
who delight in the peace of renunciation,<br>
even the gods are envious of them,<br>
the Sambuddhas, the ones who are mindful.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone245' href='#cone245' data-uid='pdhp245'>Cone 245</a>Whether in the wilds or village, whether on low or on high ground,<br>
wherever the Arahats live, that ground is surely delightful.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone246' href='#cone246' data-uid='pdhp246'>Cone 246</a>If, for even one living being, one with an uncorrupt mind,<br>
has loving-kindness, there is wholesomeness in that,<br>
but the one with compassion in mind for all living beings,<br>
that noble one makes abundant merit.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone247' href='#cone247' data-uid='pdhp247'>Cone 247</a>Those who conquered the earth, crowded with beings,<br>
those royal seers who went round sacrificing:<br>
the horse sacrifice, the man sacrifice,<br>
the stick-casting, the soma offering, the unobstructed—<br>
compared to the one who develops his mind with loving-kindness,<br>
they do not partake of even a sixteenth part,<br>
just as the whole host of stars<br>
do not partake of the radiance of the moon.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone248' href='#cone248' data-uid='pdhp248'>Cone 248</a>Then he who with a mind of loving-kindness<br>
has compassion for all living beings,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone249' href='#cone249' data-uid='pdhp249'>Cone 249</a>For he who every day and night delights in a mind of non-violence,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone250' href='#cone250' data-uid='pdhp250'>Cone 250</a>For he who every day and night<br>
has a mind that delights in cultivation,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone251' href='#cone251' data-uid='pdhp251'>Cone 251</a>For he who every day and night<br>
constantly has mindfulness of the body,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone252' href='#cone252' data-uid='pdhp252'>Cone 252</a>He who neither kills, nor has killed,<br>
conquers, nor has conquered,<br>
having loving-kindness towards all beings,<br>
he has no one who is hated.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone253' href='#cone253' data-uid='pdhp253'>Cone 253</a>For not by hatred do hatreds cease at any time in this place,<br>
they only cease with non-hatred,<br>
this truth is surely eternal.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone254' href='#cone254' data-uid='pdhp254'>Cone 254</a>The others do not understand that we should be successful here,<br>
but for those here who do understand,<br>
through that, their dissensions do cease.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone255' href='#cone255' data-uid='pdhp255'>Cone 255</a>Let us live truly happily, without hatred,<br>
amongst those who have hatred,<br>
amongst humans who have hatred let us live without hatred.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone256' href='#cone256' data-uid='pdhp256'>Cone 256</a>Let us live truly happily, without longing,<br>
amongst those who are longing,<br>
amongst humans who are longing let us live without longing.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone257' href='#cone257' data-uid='pdhp257'>Cone 257</a>We live truly happily enough having no possessions ourselves,<br>
amongst those with possessions let us live having no possessions.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone258' href='#cone258' data-uid='pdhp258'>Cone 258</a>One should see it as a bubble,<br>
one should see it as a mirage,<br>
looking on the world in this way<br>
the King of Death does not see one.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone259' href='#cone259' data-uid='pdhp259'>Cone 259</a>This body is worn out, a nest of disease, perishing,<br>
the putrid body comes to destruction, for life ends in death.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone260' href='#cone260' data-uid='pdhp260'>Cone 260</a>Having seen an old man, one afflicted and sick,<br>
having seen one deceased, after not long for the student,<br>
anxiety, sharp and extensive, arose,<br>
and the wise one cut the household bonds.</p>
