<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone278' href='#cone278' data-uid='pdhp278'>Cone 278</a>Verbally guarded, well-restrained in mind,<br>
he who does not practice a wrong deed with the body,<br>
purifying these three paths of action,<br>
would attain the unsurpassed state of peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone279' href='#cone279' data-uid='pdhp279'>Cone 279</a>One should guard against bodily faults,<br>
one should be restrained bodily,<br>
abandoning wrong bodily conduct,<br>
one should have good bodily conduct.</p>

<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone281' href='#cone281' data-uid='pdhp281'>Cone 281</a>One should guard against mental faults,<br>
one should be restrained mentally,<br>
abandoning wrong mental conduct,<br>
one should have good mental conduct.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone282' href='#cone282' data-uid='pdhp282'>Cone 282</a>The wise are restrained bodily,<br>
verbally and also mentally,<br>
the wise are restrained in every way,<br>
they are indeed very well-restrained.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone283' href='#cone283' data-uid='pdhp283'>Cone 283</a>This is something of old, Ādhora,<br>
this is not something of today:<br>
they blame the one who sits silently,<br>
they blame the one who talks in moderation,<br>
they blame the one who talks a lot,<br>
there is no one in the world not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone284' href='#cone284' data-uid='pdhp284'>Cone 284</a>There was not and there will not be,<br>
and at present there is not found<br>
a person totally blameworthy,<br>
or one totally praiseworthy.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone285' href='#cone285' data-uid='pdhp285'>Cone 285</a>He who would worship or reproach the one who is unrighteous,<br>
a fool with lack of intelligence, that is to no purpose.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone286-287' href='#cone286-287' data-uid='pdhp286-287'>Cone 286-287</a>The one who, after being examined<br>
day by day, is praised by the wise,<br>
faultless in conduct, sagacious,<br>
attending to virtue and wisdom,<br>
one who is like a golden coin,<br>
who is there worthy to blame him?<br>
That one is praised by the gods,<br>
and has been praised by the Brahmās too.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone288' href='#cone288' data-uid='pdhp288'>Cone 288</a>Not by eloquence only,<br>
or by a beautiful complexion,<br>
is a person honourable,<br>
if still jealous, selfish and deceitful.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone289' href='#cone289' data-uid='pdhp289'>Cone 289</a>In whom is truth, Dhamma, abstinence,<br>
restraint and good training,<br>
that sage who has thrown out hatred is said to be honourable.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone290' href='#cone290' data-uid='pdhp290'>Cone 290</a>Even though reciting abundant scriptures,<br>
the heedless fellow, who does not do what they say,<br>
like a cowboy counting other’s cattle,<br>
does not partake of the ascetic life.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone291' href='#cone291' data-uid='pdhp291'>Cone 291</a>Even though reciting but few scriptures,<br>
but living righteously in accordance with Dhamma,<br>
abandoning greed, hate and delusion,<br>
with mind released, completely without doubt,<br>
that one, unattached here and hereafter,<br>
surely partakes of the ascetic life.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone292' href='#cone292' data-uid='pdhp292'>Cone 292</a>One should speak out the truth, one should not get angry,<br>
when requested you should give, if only a little,<br>
through these three conditions<br>
one can go to the presence of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone293' href='#cone293' data-uid='pdhp293'>Cone 293</a>The miserly go not to the world of the gods,<br>
fools surely do not praise giving,<br>
but the wise one rejoices in giving,<br>
and through that he goes to the world of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone294' href='#cone294' data-uid='pdhp294'>Cone 294</a>Having virtue, being pure and clever,<br>
principled, knowing the truths,<br>
the good one doing the deeds that are his own,<br>
that one the people love.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone295' href='#cone295' data-uid='pdhp295'>Cone 295</a>It’s better to have eaten glowing iron balls, like flames of fire,<br>
than that the monastic who is unrestrained and unvirtuous<br>
should enjoy the country’s almsfood.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone296' href='#cone296' data-uid='pdhp296'>Cone 296</a>As <i>kusa</i> grass, wrongly grasped, cuts into the hand,<br>
so does the ascetic life, wrongly grasped,<br>
drag one down to the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone297' href='#cone297' data-uid='pdhp297'>Cone 297</a>For the person speaking falsely,<br>
who has transgressed in this one thing,<br>
who has abandoned the next world,<br>
there is no wickedness left undone.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone298' href='#cone298' data-uid='pdhp298'>Cone 298</a>For not a well-sharpened sword,<br>
or even deadly poison,<br>
destroy quite as quickly as words that are badly spoken.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone299' href='#cone299' data-uid='pdhp299'>Cone 299</a>For with the birth of a man an axe is born in his mouth,<br>
with which he cuts himself speaking a word that is badly spoken.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone300' href='#cone300' data-uid='pdhp300'>Cone 300</a>He who praises the blameworthy,<br>
or he who blames the praiseworthy,<br>
piles up bad fortune with his mouth,<br>
and because of that bad fortune he does not find happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone301' href='#cone301' data-uid='pdhp301'>Cone 301</a>(Compared to) he who has a small measure of bad fortune through dice and loses his wealth,<br>
everything (he owns), together with his self;<br>
this is indeed a far greater bad fortune: he who has a corrupt mind aimed at those faring well.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone302' href='#cone302' data-uid='pdhp302'>Cone 302</a>For one hundred and thirty-six thousand<br>
<i>nirabbudas</i>, and five <i>abbudas</i>,<br>
he goes to hell through reproaching the noble ones,<br>
having wicked verbal and mental intentions.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone303' href='#cone303' data-uid='pdhp303'>Cone 303</a>He should speak wholesomely,<br>
he should not speak wickedly,<br>
the speaking of what is wholesome is best,<br>
having spoken wickedly he suffers.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone304' href='#cone304' data-uid='pdhp304'>Cone 304</a>He should practice wholesomely,<br>
he should not speak wickedly,<br>
the speaking of what is wholesome is best,<br>
having spoken wickedly he suffers.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone305' href='#cone305' data-uid='pdhp305'>Cone 305</a>He should speak wholesome words,<br>
he should not speak wickedly,<br>
arisen anger he should constrain,<br>
he ceases from hatred.</p>
