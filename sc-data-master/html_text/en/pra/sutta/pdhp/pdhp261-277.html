the rest of the people run down the bank,<br>
but those who live righteously,<br>
conforming with this well-taught Dhamma,<br>
those folk will go beyond the realm of death,<br>
which is very hard to cross.</p>

the wise ones should develop the bright,<br>
having gone forth to homelessness from home;<br>
in solitude, where it is hard to delight,<br>
one should seek to delight in that place,<br>
having given up sense pleasures, and having no possessions,<br>
he should purify the self of defilements of mind in every way.</p>

with peaceful mind the factors of complete awakening,<br>
having given up the self,<br>
those who delight in being unattached,<br>
pollutant-free, shining forth,<br>
are emancipated in the world.</p>

mindfulness of the body<br>
who do not practice what is not to be done,<br>

their pollutants are destroyed.</p>

not practised by worldly people;<br>
let a monastic not be confident<br>
as long as the destruction of the pollutants is unattained.</p>
