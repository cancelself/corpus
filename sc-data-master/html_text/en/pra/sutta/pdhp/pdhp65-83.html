also respecting true brahmins is good.</p>

<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone69' href='#cone69' data-uid='pdhp69'>Cone 69</a>Meeting with the noble is pleasant,<br>
living with good people is pleasant,<br>
through not meeting foolish people<br>
one will constantly be happy.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone70' href='#cone70' data-uid='pdhp70'>Cone 70</a>For he who consorts with fools<br>
grieves for a long time,<br>
dwelling with fools is always suffering<br>
as it is with enemies,<br>
the wise ones dwell happily<br>
as with an assembly of kin.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone71' href='#cone71' data-uid='pdhp71'>Cone 71</a>Therefore the firm and the learned,<br>
the virtuous, dutiful and noble—<br>
follow such a true and intelligent person<br>
as the moon follows the course of the stars.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone72' href='#cone72' data-uid='pdhp72'>Cone 72</a>From love there arises grief,<br>
with love grief, with love fear,<br>
for one who is free from love<br>
there is no grief, how is there fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone73-74' href='#cone73-74' data-uid='pdhp73-74'>Cone 73-74</a>Do not associate at any time<br>
with those who are loved or with those unloved,<br>
there is suffering not meeting the loved one,<br>
and suffering from meeting the unloved one.<br>
Therefore do not hold anything as loved,<br>
for speaking of the loved is loathsome.<br>
There are no knots for those<br>
who hold nothing as loved or as unloved.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone75' href='#cone75' data-uid='pdhp75'>Cone 75</a>Hunger is the supreme sickness,<br>

content the supreme wealth,<br>
confidence the supreme kin,<br>
Nibbāna the supreme good.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone77' href='#cone77' data-uid='pdhp77'>Cone 77</a>If, by renouncing a small good,<br>
he might see a good that is large,<br>
the wise one should renounce that small good,<br>
seeing the good that is extensive.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone78' href='#cone78' data-uid='pdhp78'>Cone 78</a>For a human who is always mindful,<br>
knowing the measure in food received,<br>
his painful feelings become slight,<br>
he ages slowly, guarding his lifespan.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone79' href='#cone79' data-uid='pdhp79'>Cone 79</a>A person of good breed is rare,<br>
that one is not born everywhere,<br>
wherever that hero is born,<br>
that family gains happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone80' href='#cone80' data-uid='pdhp80'>Cone 80</a>There are surely true people everywhere,<br>
the good do not talk of desiring sense-pleasures;<br>
when touched by pleasure or by suffering,<br>
true people are not elated or depressed.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone81' href='#cone81' data-uid='pdhp81'>Cone 81</a>The victor generates hatred,<br>
the defeated one finds suffering,<br>
the one at peace lives happily,<br>
having abandoned victory and defeat.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone82' href='#cone82' data-uid='pdhp82'>Cone 82</a>Pleasant are rivers with good fords,<br>
pleasant is the person conquered by Dhamma,<br>
the acquisition of faith is good,<br>
doing nothing wicked is good.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone83' href='#cone83' data-uid='pdhp83'>Cone 83</a>It is pleasant to meet the virtuous,<br>
it is pleasant to meet the learned,<br>
it is pleasant to meet the Worthy Ones,<br>
who are free from attachments.</p>
