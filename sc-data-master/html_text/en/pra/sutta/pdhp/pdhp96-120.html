<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone96' href='#cone96' data-uid='pdhp96'>Cone 96</a>Hasten to do wholesome deeds,<br>
ward off the mind from wickedness,<br>
for the mind of the one slow in merit delights in wickedness.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone97' href='#cone97' data-uid='pdhp97'>Cone 97</a>Should a person do that which is wicked,<br>
he should not do it again and again,<br>
let him not place his intention in it,<br>
for there is an accumulation of suffering for the wicked one.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone98' href='#cone98' data-uid='pdhp98'>Cone 98</a>If a person should make merit,<br>
he should do it again and again,<br>
let him place his intention there,<br>
there is an increase of joy for the one who has made merit.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone99' href='#cone99' data-uid='pdhp99'>Cone 99</a>For the pure one there is always fasting,<br>
for the pure one there is always the fast day,<br>
for the pure one, the one of clean deeds,<br>
his vow always succeeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone100' href='#cone100' data-uid='pdhp100'>Cone 100</a>Better undone is a wrong-doing,<br>
a wrong-doing one later regrets,<br>
he grieves, thinking: “I have done a bad deed,”<br>
gone to a bad fate, he grieves much more.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone101' href='#cone101' data-uid='pdhp101'>Cone 101</a>Better done is what is well-done, which,<br>
when done, one does not regret<br>
he is happy, thinking: “I have done a good deed,”<br>
gone to a good fate, he is happy much more.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone102' href='#cone102' data-uid='pdhp102'>Cone 102</a>Even the wicked one experiences good fortune<br>
while the wickedness does not ripen,<br>
but when the wickedness ripens<br>
then the wicked one experiences wicked things.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone103' href='#cone103' data-uid='pdhp103'>Cone 103</a>Even the fortunate one experiences wickedness<br>
as long as the good fortune does not ripen,<br>
but when the fortune ripens<br>
then the fortunate one experiences good fortune.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone104' href='#cone104' data-uid='pdhp104'>Cone 104</a>Even the wicked one does good<br>
while the wickedness does not ripen,<br>
but when the time has gone by<br>
the wicked one experiences wicked things.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone105' href='#cone105' data-uid='pdhp105'>Cone 105</a>Even the fortunate one does wickedness<br>
as long as the good fortune does not ripen,<br>
but when the time has gone by<br>
the fortunate one experiences good fortune.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone106' href='#cone106' data-uid='pdhp106'>Cone 106</a>If there is no wound for him in his hand<br>
he can carry poison with his hand,<br>
poison does not enter without a wound,<br>
there is no wickedness for the one who does not do wrong.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone107' href='#cone107' data-uid='pdhp107'>Cone 107</a>A wicked deed that has been done,<br>
like milk, does not turn all at once,<br>
smouldering, it follows the fool,<br>
like a fire covered with ashes.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone108' href='#cone108' data-uid='pdhp108'>Cone 108</a>A wicked deed that has been done,<br>
like a knife, does not cut all at once,<br>
but when death comes he knows<br>
the destiny of those who do wickedness.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone109' href='#cone109' data-uid='pdhp109'>Cone 109</a>You should prepare beforehand what is to be done,<br>
do not tremble at what is to be done at the time for it,<br>
for such a one who has prepared what is to be done,<br>
does not tremble at what is to be done at the time for it.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone110' href='#cone110' data-uid='pdhp110'>Cone 110</a>One should prepare to do that<br>
which one knows is for one’s welfare,<br>
the sage, the wise one should make effort,<br>
not with the thinking of the charioteer.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone111-112' href='#cone111-112' data-uid='pdhp111-112'>Cone 111-112</a>As the charioteer who abandoned the smooth path of the highway,<br>
and approached the rough path,<br>
then he broods, as upon a broken axle,<br>
so the one departing from Dhamma<br>
and following what is not Dhamma,<br>
when that fool comes to Death’s jaws he broods,<br>
as upon a broken axle.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone113' href='#cone113' data-uid='pdhp113'>Cone 113</a>Many wearing the monastic robe around their necks<br>
are wicked, unrestrained.<br>
Wicked ones! Through your wicked deeds,<br>
you re-arise in the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone114' href='#cone114' data-uid='pdhp114'>Cone 114</a>One who speaks what is untrue goes to the underworld,<br>
he who says: ‘I do not do’ what he has done,<br>
both of these are just the same when they have gone<br>
to the hereafter, they are humans who did base deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone115' href='#cone115' data-uid='pdhp115'>Cone 115</a>He who offends against the inoffensive one,<br>
a purified and passionless person:<br>
that wicked deed then returns to the fool,<br>
like fine dust that is thrown against the wind.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone116' href='#cone116' data-uid='pdhp116'>Cone 116</a>Like a merchant on a fearful path,<br>
with few friends and great wealth,<br>
as one loving life would avoid poison,<br>
so should one avoid wicked deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone117' href='#cone117' data-uid='pdhp117'>Cone 117</a>He who desires happiness for himself<br>
by causing suffering for another,<br>
being associated thus with hatred,<br>
is not fully released from suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone118' href='#cone118' data-uid='pdhp118'>Cone 118</a>The smell of a corpse is cut off eventually,<br>
also of one bloated<br>
when nights have passed,<br>
but of the man who lives not by Dhamma<br>
day by day his smell is never cut off.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone119' href='#cone119' data-uid='pdhp119'>Cone 119</a>Just as householders having great treasures,<br>
when the city is on fire and burning,<br>
because of their pearls, jewels, crystal and silver,<br>
make effort, thinking: “We will save something”,<br>
so the ascetics of great wisdom,<br>
noble ones training along the noble path,<br>
oppressed with the fear of birth,<br>
old age, death, afflicted by suffering,<br>
make effort, thinking: “We will attain peace”.</p>
