<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone195' href='#cone195' data-uid='pdhp195'>Cone 195</a>Neither going naked, nor matted hair, nor mud,<br>
nor fasting or lying on stony ground,<br>
dusty clothes, or striving while squatting,<br>
can purify a mortal who has not removed uncertainty.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone196' href='#cone196' data-uid='pdhp196'>Cone 196</a>Even if he were to adorn himself,<br>
but is trained, peaceful, settled, living by Dhamma,<br>
and has put aside the stick towards all living beings,<br>
he is a brahmin, an ascetic, a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone197' href='#cone197' data-uid='pdhp197'>Cone 197</a>Do not speak anything harsh,<br>
spoken to they might answer back to you,<br>
for arrogant talk entails misery,<br>
and they might strike you back with a stick.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone198' href='#cone198' data-uid='pdhp198'>Cone 198</a>If you make a sound<br>
like a gong that is struck,<br>
you will undergo the rounds of births and deaths for a long time.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone199' href='#cone199' data-uid='pdhp199'>Cone 199</a>If you make no sound like a gong that is not struck,<br>
you are like one who has attained Nibbāna,<br>
contention is not found in you.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone200' href='#cone200' data-uid='pdhp200'>Cone 200</a>Like a cowherd with a stick drives cattle to pasture,<br>
so do old age and death overpower living beings.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone201' href='#cone201' data-uid='pdhp201'>Cone 201</a>Like a cowherd with a stick protects the owner’s cattle,<br>
so one should watch over oneself,<br>
and you should not let the moment pass,<br>
for when the chance has passed<br>
they grieve when consigned to the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone202' href='#cone202' data-uid='pdhp202'>Cone 202</a>Everyone trembles at sticks,<br>
for all of them life is dear,<br>
comparing oneself with others,<br>
one should not hurt or have them hurt.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone203' href='#cone203' data-uid='pdhp203'>Cone 203</a>One who harms with a stick beings who desire happiness,<br>
while seeking happiness for himself,<br>
won’t find happiness after death.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone204' href='#cone204' data-uid='pdhp204'>Cone 204</a>One who harms not with a stick beings who desire happiness,<br>
while seeking happiness for himself,<br>
will find happiness after death.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone205' href='#cone205' data-uid='pdhp205'>Cone 205</a>One should not keep company with wicked friends,<br>
one should not keep company with the ignoble,<br>
you should keep company with the sage and wise,<br>
you should keep company with superior people.<br>
keeping company with such is surely better for you, not worse.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone206' href='#cone206' data-uid='pdhp206'>Cone 206</a>One should regard someone who shows your faults<br>
just like one who points out hidden treasure,<br>
one should keep company with<br>
such a sagacious person who reproves you;<br>
keeping company with such is surely better for you, not worse.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone207' href='#cone207' data-uid='pdhp207'>Cone 207</a>One should advise and instruct,<br>
and forbid whatever is vile,<br>
for this is dear to the good,<br>
but it is not dear to the bad.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone208' href='#cone208' data-uid='pdhp208'>Cone 208</a>Therefore the good and the bad from here go to various destinies,<br>
the bad go to the underworld,<br>
the good cross over to heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone209' href='#cone209' data-uid='pdhp209'>Cone 209</a>The person of little learning increases in age like an ox,<br>
for although his flesh does increase,<br>
his wisdom does not increase.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone210' href='#cone210' data-uid='pdhp210'>Cone 210</a>There are four states the man who is heedless,<br>
the man who consorts with other man’s wives, undergoes:<br>
he gains demerit, an uncomfortable bed,<br>
blame as third, and rebirth in the underworld as fourth.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone211' href='#cone211' data-uid='pdhp211'>Cone 211</a>Gaining demerit and a bad destiny,<br>
and only the little delight of a scared man with a scared woman,<br>
and kings who apply heavy punishment,<br>
at the break up of the body he goes to the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone212' href='#cone212' data-uid='pdhp212'>Cone 212</a>The restrained go to a good destiny,<br>
the unrestrained go to a bad destiny,<br>
thinking: “I should not exhibit confidence,”<br>
the wise one wanders peacefully.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone213' href='#cone213' data-uid='pdhp213'>Cone 213</a>Do not, elephant, approach the Buddha,<br>
for there is suffering, elephant, in approaching the Buddha,<br>
for the one who attacks the Buddha, elephant,<br>
does not go from here to a good destiny.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone214' href='#cone214' data-uid='pdhp214'>Cone 214</a>As a lion wanders his mountain fortress,<br>
his resort on the mountainside,<br>
do not hurt the man-hero, the one without fear,<br>
the one of superior effort.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone215' href='#cone215' data-uid='pdhp215'>Cone 215</a>Like an elephant in battle<br>
endures arrows shot from bow<br>
so will I endure abuse,<br>
for many people are unvirtuous.</p>
