to places with beautiful trees.<br>
That is not a secure refuge,<br>
that is not the refuge supreme,<br>
nor is it the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering.</p>

the Dhamma and the Saṅgha,<br>
and who sees as it really is the four noble truths.<br>
That is a secure refuge,<br>
that is the refuge supreme,<br>
that is the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering.</p>

their leader goes crookedly,<br>
they all will go crookedly,<br>
as their guide crookedly does go.<br>
So it is with humans,<br>
he who is agreed upon as chief,<br>
if he lives unrighteously,<br>
so will other people.</p>

when thrown into darkness,<br>
do you not seek for a light?</p>

when consigned to the underworld.</p>

small and great, in every way—<br>
through the appeasing of wicked deeds he is said to be an ascetic.</p>

consisting of contact with conceit are strong,<br>

sufferings never do befall the one having no possessions.</p>
