<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone157' href='#cone157' data-uid='pdhp157'>Cone 157</a>Lack of repetition is the ruin of the Vedā,<br>
a lack of maintenance is the ruin of homes,<br>
indolence is the ruin of one’s appearance,<br>
heedlessness is the ruin of those on guard.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone158' href='#cone158' data-uid='pdhp158'>Cone 158</a>Bad conduct is a woman’s stain,<br>
stinginess is a giver’s stain,<br>
wicked deeds are a stain<br>
both in this world and in the next.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone159' href='#cone159' data-uid='pdhp159'>Cone 159</a>I say there is a stain worse than that,<br>
ignorance is a deadly stain,<br>
after abandoning those stains,<br>
live without stains, monastics!</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone160' href='#cone160' data-uid='pdhp160'>Cone 160</a>As a rust stain arises from iron,<br>
and arisen from that, it eats it away,<br>
so with one who is overindulgent—<br>
his deeds lead him to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone161' href='#cone161' data-uid='pdhp161'>Cone 161</a>You are now a withered leaf,<br>
Yama’s men stand waiting for you,<br>
you stand at decay’s door,<br>
with no provisions for the journey found.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone162' href='#cone162' data-uid='pdhp162'>Cone 162</a>You should strive and endeavour by yourself,<br>
like a smith, you should remove the stain,<br>
removing the stain, blemishless,<br>
you seek the second noble realm.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone163' href='#cone163' data-uid='pdhp163'>Cone 163</a>The sage gradually,<br>
little by little, moment by moment,<br>
should remove the stain from himself,<br>
like a smith removes the stain from silver.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone164' href='#cone164' data-uid='pdhp164'>Cone 164</a>Life is light for one without shame,<br>
he lives a life with defilements,<br>
backbiting and recklessness,<br>
with the bold courage of a crow.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone165' href='#cone165' data-uid='pdhp165'>Cone 165</a>Life is hard when endowed with shame,<br>
for the one constantly seeking purity,<br>
for one sincere, and not reckless,<br>
looking for purity of life.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone166' href='#cone166' data-uid='pdhp166'>Cone 166</a>Easy to see are others’ fault,<br>
but one’s own is hard to see,<br>
for one sifts other peoples’ faults like they were chaff,<br>
but conceals one’s own faults,<br>
like a crafty player conceals his defeat.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone167' href='#cone167' data-uid='pdhp167'>Cone 167</a>Easily done are things not good,<br>
and unbeneficial for oneself,<br>
but that which is beneficial and good<br>
is supremely hard to do.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone168' href='#cone168' data-uid='pdhp168'>Cone 168</a>Easily done are things not good,<br>
and unbeneficial for oneself,<br>
but only those beneficial and good<br>
are done by the wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone169' href='#cone169' data-uid='pdhp169'>Cone 169</a>They are ashamed of what is not shameful,<br>
not ashamed of what is shameful,<br>
seeing fear in what is not fearful,<br>
not seeing fear in what is fearful,<br>
undertaking wrong views,<br>
beings go to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone170' href='#cone170' data-uid='pdhp170'>Cone 170</a>Finding blame in what is blameless,<br>
not perceiving blame in what is blameable,<br>
undertaking wrong views,<br>
beings go to a bad destiny.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone171' href='#cone171' data-uid='pdhp171'>Cone 171</a>Finding the essential in the unessential,<br>
and perceiving the unessential in the essential,<br>
they do not understand what is the essential,<br>
and resort to wrong intention.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone172' href='#cone172' data-uid='pdhp172'>Cone 172</a>Knowing the essential in what is essential,<br>
and the unessential in what is unessential,<br>
they understand what is essential,<br>
and resort to right intention.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone173' href='#cone173' data-uid='pdhp173'>Cone 173</a>Engaging oneself in what is not suitable,<br>
not engaging in what is suitable,<br>
abandoning the good, grasping the loved,<br>
they envy those who endeavour for good.</p>
