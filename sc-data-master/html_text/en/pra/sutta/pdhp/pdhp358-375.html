<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone358' href='#cone358' data-uid='pdhp358'>Cone 358</a>The eightfold is the best of paths,<br>
four principles the best of truths,<br>
dispassion the best of states,<br>
the Visionary the best of men.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone359' href='#cone359' data-uid='pdhp359'>Cone 359</a>The path was declared by me,<br>
the removal of the dart by knowledge,<br>
your duty is to have ardour declare the Realised Ones,<br>
entering this path meditators<br>
will be released from the bonds of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone360' href='#cone360' data-uid='pdhp360'>Cone 360</a>This is the path, there is no other,<br>
for insight and for purity,<br>
you should enter upon this path,<br>
this is the confounding of Māra,<br>
having entered upon this path you will make an end to suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone361' href='#cone361' data-uid='pdhp361'>Cone 361</a>Cut down the forest of defilements not just the trees,<br>
from the forest arises a danger,<br>
having cut down the forest and thicket,<br>
you will go further without forests.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone362' href='#cone362' data-uid='pdhp362'>Cone 362</a>For as long as an atom of desire<br>
of a man for his kin is not cut down,<br>
the mind is in bondage there,<br>
like a calf in bondage to mother’s milk.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone363' href='#cone363' data-uid='pdhp363'>Cone 363</a>Cut off any affection for one’s self,<br>
like an autumn lotus plucked with the hand,<br>
develop fully the path to peace and<br>
Nibbāna taught by the Fortunate One.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone364' href='#cone364' data-uid='pdhp364'>Cone 364</a>Here I will make the rains retreat, here during winter and summer,<br>
in just such a way a fool thinks, not understanding the danger.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone365' href='#cone365' data-uid='pdhp365'>Cone 365</a>That person whose mind is attached and besotted<br>
by cattle and children,<br>
is snatched away by death<br>
just as a sleeping village by a great flood.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone366' href='#cone366' data-uid='pdhp366'>Cone 366</a>Children are not a refuge, nor fathers, not even brothers,<br>
for one afflicted by the End-Maker there is no refuge in relatives.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone367' href='#cone367' data-uid='pdhp367'>Cone 367</a>Relatives cry and wail together in this way<br>
people still depart, against their desires they give him up.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone368' href='#cone368' data-uid='pdhp368'>Cone 368</a>Understanding this the sage, wise, free of selfishness,<br>
should constantly purify the path that is leading to heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone369' href='#cone369' data-uid='pdhp369'>Cone 369</a>Therefore a wise man looking for his own welfare<br>
should constantly purify the path that is leading to heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone370' href='#cone370' data-uid='pdhp370'>Cone 370</a>Endowed with faith and virtue,<br>
wise, well-composed,<br>
one constantly purifies the path,<br>
which brings safety in the next world.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone371' href='#cone371' data-uid='pdhp371'>Cone 371</a>Endowed with faith and virtue,<br>
wise, composed,<br>
delights in practising the path,<br>
delights in internal peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone372' href='#cone372' data-uid='pdhp372'>Cone 372</a>Endowed with faith and virtue,<br>
always delighting in being wise,<br>
one advances like burning fire against the fetter, small or large,<br>
whether it is wicked conceit or hypocrisy.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone373' href='#cone373' data-uid='pdhp373'>Cone 373</a>All conditions are impermanent,<br>
when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering—<br>
this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone374' href='#cone374' data-uid='pdhp374'>Cone 374</a>All components of mind and body are without self,<br>
when one sees this with wisdom,<br>
then one grows tired of suffering—<br>
this is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone375' href='#cone375' data-uid='pdhp375'>Cone 375</a>From effort originates wisdom,<br>
without effort wisdom is destroyed,<br>
having understood these two paths of development and decline,<br>
the sage should train so that his wisdom increases.</p>
