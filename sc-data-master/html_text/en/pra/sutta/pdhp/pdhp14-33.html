<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone14' href='#cone14' data-uid='pdhp14'>Cone 14</a>Heedfulness is the deathless state,<br>
heedlessness the state of the dead,<br>
the heedful do not die,<br>
but those who are heedless are as if dead.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone15' href='#cone15' data-uid='pdhp15'>Cone 15</a>The wise, understanding this difference in regard to heedfulness,<br>
rejoice in heedfulness,<br>
delight in the domain of the Noble Ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone16' href='#cone16' data-uid='pdhp16'>Cone 16</a>Those who meditate all the time,<br>
constant and firm in their effort,<br>
those wise ones reach Nibbāna,<br>
the unsurpassed release from all bonds.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone17' href='#cone17' data-uid='pdhp17'>Cone 17</a>The foolish and stupid people cultivate heedlessness,<br>
but the sagacious one guards heedfulness<br>
just as his greatest wealth.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone18' href='#cone18' data-uid='pdhp18'>Cone 18</a>Heedful amongst the heedless ones,<br>
wakeful amongst the ones who sleep,<br>
like a swift horse who abandons a weak horse,<br>
the true sage moves on.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone19' href='#cone19' data-uid='pdhp19'>Cone 19</a>When the wise one eliminates heedlessness with his heedfulness,<br>
and mounts the palace of wisdom,<br>
griefless, he looks on grieving people;<br>
the wise one, like one standing on a mountain,<br>
looks down on the fools who are standing on the plains.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone20' href='#cone20' data-uid='pdhp20'>Cone 20</a>Whoever before was heedless,<br>
but later is not heedless,<br>
that one shines brightly in this world<br>
like the moon released from a cloud.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone21' href='#cone21' data-uid='pdhp21'>Cone 21</a>Whoever before was heedless,<br>
but later is not heedless,<br>
he, being mindful,<br>
can overcome clinging to the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone22' href='#cone22' data-uid='pdhp22'>Cone 22</a>A monastic who values heedfulness,<br>
seeing danger in heedlessness,<br>
is unable to fall away:<br>
he is well-nigh to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone23' href='#cone23' data-uid='pdhp23'>Cone 23</a>A monastic who values heedfulness,<br>
seeing danger in heedlessness,<br>
advances like burning fire against the fetter, small or large.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone24' href='#cone24' data-uid='pdh24'>Cone 24</a>You should delight in heedfulness,<br>
you should always protect your mind,<br>
you should raise yourself from this pit<br>
like the tusker sunk in the mud.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone25' href='#cone25' data-uid='pdhp25'>Cone 25</a>Rejoicing in heedfulness,<br>
prudent, restrained in virtue,<br>
in good time they attain that where,<br>
once attained, there is no grieving.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone26' href='#cone26' data-uid='pdhp26'>Cone 26</a>Do not rejoice in heedlessness,<br>
unacquainted with delight in sensual pleasure,<br>
living in this way, ardent,<br>
with mind at peace, not proud,<br>
devoted to mental calm,<br>
he will make an end to suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone27' href='#cone27' data-uid='pdhp27'>Cone 27</a>One should strive, not be heedless,<br>
one should live by Dhamma, with good conduct,<br>
living by Dhamma one lives<br>
at ease in this world and the next.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone28' href='#cone28' data-uid='pdhp28'>Cone 28</a>For he who is active, mindful,<br>
pure in deeds, considerate,<br>
self-controlled, living by Dhamma,<br>
heedful, his fame increases.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone29' href='#cone29' data-uid='pdhp29'>Cone 29</a>Through activity, heedfulness,<br>
through self-control and through restraint,<br>
the sage should make an island<br>
that no flood waters can overwhelm.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone30' href='#cone30' data-uid='pdhp30'>Cone 30</a>The one who has not energy at a time for energy,<br>
youthful, strong, lazy in his home,<br>
whose mind lacks right intention and is indolent—<br>
the lazy one does not go along wisdom’s path.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone31' href='#cone31' data-uid='pdhp31'>Cone 31</a>One should not follow lowly things,<br>
one should not abide heedlessly,<br>
one should not follow a wrong view,<br>
one should not foster worldliness.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone32' href='#cone32' data-uid='pdhp32'>Cone 32</a>One is not a Dhamma-bearer merely through speaking much,<br>
but the one who, having heard a little,<br>
would see Dhamma for himself,<br>
is one who bears Dhamma,<br>
the one who is not heedless regarding Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref cone' id='cone33' href='#cone33' data-uid='pdhp33'>Cone 33</a>Consider the Dhamma heedfully,<br>
do not let your mind swirl around in strands of desire,<br>
do not, heedless, swallow a hot iron ball,<br>
and, while burning, cry: ‘This is suffering.’</p>
