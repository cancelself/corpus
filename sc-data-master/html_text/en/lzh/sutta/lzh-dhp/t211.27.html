<h1>27. Firmly holding by the law (dhammatthvaggo)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref beal' id='beal1' href='#beal1'>Beal 1</a>There was once a very old Brahman, called Sa-che (Sacha or Satya) Nirgrantha, celebrated for his acuteness in discussion. He had 500 disciples, and all of them were so self-opinionated with regard to their superior learning that they used to clothe themselves with iron plates, lest their wisdom should overflow and run to waste <span class='add'>(sic.)</span>. Now when Sacha heard that Buddha had come into the world, and was converting men by his superior wisdom, he was filled with jealousy, and could not rest at night from very envy, and therefore, addressing his disciples, he said, “I hear that the Shaman Gotama professes to be a Buddha. I will go and ask him a few questions, and make him blush for shame when he finds he cannot answer them.” Accordingly, he with his followers went to the Jetavana (Vihāra), and as they stood without seeing the glory of Buddha's person, like the sun when he first comes forth in his strength, they were overpowered and confused by their feelings, and so passing through the door they came before Buddha, and did him reverence. On this Buddha requested them to be seated. Being so seated, the Nirgrantha asked Buddha as follows:— “Who is the just man? Who is the learned man? Who is the reverend man? What is true beauty and grace? What is a Shaman? Who is a true Bhikshu? and who is the truly enlightened? and who the obedient man (who respectfully observes the rules of moral conduct)? If you are able, be pleased to answer these questions for the sake of my followers.”<br>
On this the World-honoured, perceiving exactly how the case lay, answered in these stanzas:—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The man who is always anxious and desirous to learn, who walks uprightly, who ponders on and considers the character of precious wisdom, this man is called Just <span class='add'>(i.e., Righteous; one who has attained the way, or Bōdhi)</span>. And who is the man of Knowledge? He who depends not on any fine distinction of words—who is free from fear and from apprehension, who stands by what is right—he is the man of Knowledge. And who is the Reverend man (aged)? Not he who has come to old age (sexegenarian)—his form bent, his hair white—for with all that he may be but a fool. But he who ponders on and inquires into the Law (the Dharma), who regulates and restrains his conduct, (is full of) love and virtue, who is able to penetrate into hidden secrets, and is pure—this man is rightly called 'Reverend.' And who is the graceful and perfect man? Not he who possesses beauty of form like the flowers (that charm us); not he who covets and longs for the empty vanities of personal adornment; not he whose words and conduct are opposed to one another; but he who is able to give up every vicious way, who has got rid of it from the very root, who is enlightened without a remnant of hatred—this man is truly graceful and upright (<i>or respectable, i.e., admirable in conduct</i>). And who is the Shaman? Not he who is shaven perforce, who speaks untruth, and covets possession, or who is a slave of desire like the rest of men; but he who is able to put an end to (to compose) every wicked (desire), to silence every personal preference, to quiet his mind, and put an end to thought—this man is called a Shaman. And who is called a Bhikshu? Not he who at stated times begs his food; not he who walks unrighteously (heretically), but hopes to be considered a disciple, desiring to establish a character (as a religious person), and that is all; but he who gives up every cause (karma) of guilt, and who lives continently and purely, who by wisdom is able to crush every evil (inclination)—this man is a true Bhikshu. And who is the truly enlightened (or the wise man)? Not he who is simply mute, whilst the busy work of his mind is impure—merely accommodating himself to the outer rule and that is all; but he whose heart is without preference (indifferent), whose inward life is pure and spiritual (empty), perfectly unmoved and dead to this or that (person or thing)—this man is called an inwardly enlightened man (Muni?) And who is a man of Bōdhi (an Ariya or 'elected one')? Not he who saves the life of all things, but he who is filled with universal benevolence, who has no malice in his heart—he is a man of Bōdhi. And the man who observes the Law is not he who talks much, but one who keeps his body (himself) in subjection to the Law (Religion), although he be a plain, untaught man, always guarding the way (of truth) without any forgetfulness—this man is an observer of the Law <span class='add'>(i.e., Dhammaṭṭho)</span>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On hearing these words, Sacha Nirgrantha and his 500 followers were all filled with joy, and became followers of Buddha (Shamans). The Nirgrantha arrived at the condition (heart) of a Bōdhisatwa, the others became Rahats.</p>
