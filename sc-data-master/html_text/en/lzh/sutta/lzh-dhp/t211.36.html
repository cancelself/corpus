<h1>36. Nirvāna</h1>
</header>
<p>In days of old when Buddha was residing in the Gridhrakūta Mountain, near Rājagriha, with the whole assembly of the Bhikshus, 1250 in number, the King of Magadha, whose name was Ajātaśatru, being then ruler of 100 kingdoms, was in perplexity as to one of them called Yuechi (Getae?), which refused to pay him tribute, although the country abounded in wealth, and was highly prosperous. On this the King sent his prime minister called Yu-she, to ask Buddha what he should do, and whether he would be successful in using force against the rebellious kingdom. Having come into the presence of Buddha and put the question, the World-honoured replied: “So long as the King of the Yue-chi observes the seven rules, he will not be easily overcome.” On this the minister inquired as to the character of these seven rules, to which the master answered: (1.) “So long as the people of the Yue-chi observe right rules in self-government, in their several villages and communities, so long they will be able to protect themselves. (2.) So long as the ministers and rulers hold together, and agree, and govern justly, so long, etc. (3.) So long as they in a national view, obey the laws, and submit to their direction without partiality or favour, so long they will be unconquerable. (4.) So long as the Yue-chi observe the rules of decorum between man and woman, and depart not from these rules of propriety, so long, etc. (5.) So long as the Yue-chi observe the rules of reverence due to father and mother and other relations, and dutifully provide for their wants, so long, etc. (6.) So long as the Yue-chi religiously observe the ceremonies of the four seasons, in doing homage to heaven and earth, so long, etc. (7.) So long as the Yue-chi pay respect to all their religious teachers (Shamans), and especially those who have come to them from far (travellers or religious guests), and provide them with the usual necessaries, such as food, bedding, medicine, etc., so long, etc.<br>
These are the seven rules, if the Yue-chi observe only one of them, it would be difficult to overpower them, how much more if they regard the seven, and then the World-honoured added these words :—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Rely not too entirely on the advantage of victory (conquest), for though you may prevail in battle, yet there is still sorrow in store; rather should a man seek the rules of self-conquest, having conquered himself, then there will be no further ground for birth (or, continued life).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The minister having heard these words, was immediately convinced (obtained the rudiments of truth (wisdom or Bōdhi)), and those in the assembly who had not yet entered the Paths, were enabled to do so. The minister then rising from his seat, begged permission to depart, and on being so permitted by Buddha, he went back to the King and told him what the master had said. On this the King gave up all his intentions to go to war, and in consequence the Yue-chi returned to their obedience and submitted to the King.</p>
