<h1>26. Taints</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.1' href='#vgns26.1'>Verse 26.1</a>He who while living has done no good,<br>
At death will fall into the evil destinies.<br>
Swiftly he will go with no [rest] in between<br>
And on arriving, he will find no provisions.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.2' href='#vgns26.2'>Verse 26.2</a>You should seek wisdom<br>
To light up the mind lamp.<br>
Remove taints, don’t be defiled;<br>
And you will be rid of the unsatisfactory body.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.3' href='#vgns26.3'>Verse 26.3</a>The wise man, gradually,<br>
Slowly and progressively,<br>
Cleanses his mind of stains;<br>
Like a smith refining gold.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.4' href='#vgns26.4'>Verse 26.4</a>Evil, arisen in a man’s mind<br>
Corrodes his own body,<br>
Even as rust from an iron<br>
Eats away itself.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.5' href='#vgns26.5'>Verse 26.5</a>Non-recitation is the taint of words<br>
Non-exertion is the taint of the home<br>
Non-adornment is the taint of beauty<br>
Heedlessness is the taint of work.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.6' href='#vgns26.6'>Verse 26.6</a>Avarice is the taint of giving<br>
Unskillfulness is the taint of action,<br>
Both in this life and in the next,<br>
Evil dharmas always constitute taints.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.7' href='#vgns26.7'>Verse 26.7</a>The taint of all taints<br>
Is ignorance, the worst.<br>
Train to give up evil,<br>
O <i>bhikṣus</i>! and be taintless.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.8' href='#vgns26.8'>Verse 26.8</a>An easy life is one without shame,<br>
Like a crow with a long beak.<br>
Which brazenly bears dishonour.<br>
—Such is a life of defilement.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.9' href='#vgns26.9'>Verse 26.9</a>A shameful person, though life be hard,<br>
Takes righteously, [remaining] cleanly [of life].<br>
He shuns dishonour and recklessness.<br>
—Such is a life of purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.10' href='#vgns26.10'>Verse 26.10</a>A fool is one indulging in killing,<br>
In speaking untruth,<br>
In taking what is not given,<br>
In trespassing on other’s wives.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.11' href='#vgns26.11'>Verse 26.11</a>In conscious moral transgressions<br>
In getting addicted to intoxicating drinks<br>
Such a man, in every life<br>
Digs up his own root.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.12' href='#vgns26.12'>Verse 26.12</a>Understand thus, O man<br>
Do not contemplate on evil;<br>
A fool who draws near to wickedness<br>
Will for long get himself burnt.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.13' href='#vgns26.13'>Verse 26.13</a>People give either out of faith<br>
Or in order to get fame.<br>
If one covets others’ worthless ornaments,<br>
One will not attain pure concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.14' href='#vgns26.14'>Verse 26.14</a>If one completely removes covetousness,<br>
Cutting off the [craving] mind by the root,<br>
And remains one-minded day and night,<br>
One is sure to attain mental concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.15' href='#vgns26.15'>Verse 26.15</a>Sensual attachment constitutes a taint;<br>
From defilement, there is the corruption of taints<br>
Not getting defiled, nor coursing [in sensual attachment]<br>
One becomes pure and leaves behind the fools.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.16' href='#vgns26.16'>Verse 26.16</a>Seeing others corroding themselves,<br>
One should always reflect within:<br>
Corruption in practice is self-humiliation;<br>
Corruptions having ended, there is no taint.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.17' href='#vgns26.17'>Verse 26.17</a>There is no fire hotter than lust.<br>
There is no speed greater than anger.<br>
There is no net denser than delusion.<br>
The vracing stream is more rapid than a river.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.18' href='#vgns26.18'>Verse 26.18</a>There is no track in the sky.<br>
There is no outside thought for a śramaṇa.<br>
Men all delight in evil.<br>
Only the Buddha is pure, without defilement.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns26.19' href='#vgns26.19'>Verse 26.19</a>There is no track in the sky.<br>
There are no outside thoughts for a śramaṇa.<br>
In the world nothing has permanence.<br>
For the Buddha, there is naught of the self.</p>
