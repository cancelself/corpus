<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.1' href='#vgns18.1'>Verse 18.1</a>All are afraid of death.<br>
None does not fear the pain [inflicted with] rods.<br>
Just as you would forgive yourself,<br>
Don’t kill; don’t strike with rods.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.2' href='#vgns18.2'>Verse 18.2</a>He who ever cares for the well-being of creatures,<br>
And does not inflict pain on them;<br>
Will meet with no harm in this life,<br>
And be always well and happy hereafter.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.3' href='#vgns18.3'>Verse 18.3</a>Do not speak harsh words;<br>
He who speaks thus must fear retribution.<br>
Evil being done, disaster will follow,<br>
And knives and rods will come upon your body.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.4' href='#vgns18.4'>Verse 18.4</a>Be kind in uttering words,<br>
Like knocking at a gong [gently].<br>
When you dispute no more,<br>
You will transcend existence easily.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.5' href='#vgns18.5'>Verse 18.5</a>He who strikes the good ones with sticks,<br>
And vilifies those who are innocent;<br>
Will be retributed ten-fold with misfortune.<br>
Which will befall him promptly and inevitably.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.6' href='#vgns18.6'>Verse 18.6</a>[Firstly], severe pain while living;<br>
[Secondly], physical injury;<br>
[Thirdly], spontaneous illness;<br>
[Fourthly], mental disorder;</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.7' href='#vgns18.7'>Verse 18.7</a>[Fifthly], false accusation from others;<br>
[Sixthly], trouble from the magistrate;<br>
[Seventhly], destruction of assets;<br>
[Eighthly], separation from relatives;</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.8' href='#vgns18.8'>Verse 18.8</a>[Ninethly] His houses, and everything therein<br>
Being burnt away by fire;<br>
[Tenthly] Falling into hell at death.<br>
Such are the ten [misfortunes].</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.9' href='#vgns18.9'>Verse 18.9</a>Though one might go naked or shave one’s head,<br>
Or for life put on straw-clothes,<br>
Or bathe oneself [in sacred rivers] [or] squat on rocks,<br>
What use are these for [overcoming] one’s doubts?</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.10' href='#vgns18.10'>Verse 18.10</a>He who neither strikes, kills nor burns,<br>
Nor seeks to be a winner;<br>
Who loves all living beings,<br>
Will meet with no enmity.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.11' href='#vgns18.11'>Verse 18.11</a>If there be a person in the world,<br>
Who knows to be shameful;<br>
He is one being induced to progress,<br>
Like a thoroughbred being whipped.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.12' href='#vgns18.12'>Verse 18.12</a>Like a fine horse when whipped,<br>
Advances far on the path.<br>
Even so a man endowed with faith, virtue,<br>
Mental concentration and vigour;<br>
Commits to the Path and accomplishes wisdom,<br>
Thereby eliminating all sufferings.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.13' href='#vgns18.13'>Verse 18.13</a>He who [though] well-adorned practices the dharma,<br>
Who restrains himself and upholds the pure life,<br>
Laying aside the cudgel towards all creatures,<br>
Is said to be a <i>śramaṇa</i>, a spiritual cultivator.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns18.14' href='#vgns18.14'>Verse 18.14</a>He who is harmless towards all creatures,<br>
Will never in his life be harmed,<br>
If he is always kind towards all,<br>
Who is there to be his enemy?</p>
