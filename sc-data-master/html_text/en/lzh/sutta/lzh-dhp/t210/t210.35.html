<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.1' href='#vgns35.1'>Verse 35.1</a>Stop the stream [of craving] and cross over,<br>
Be desireless like a brāhma;<br>
Having known the exhaustion of conditionings,<br>
One is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.2' href='#vgns35.2'>Verse 35.2</a>By means of the non-dual dharma,<br>
He is purified and crosses the sea;<br>
All his fetters of desire are removed<br>
—Such a one is a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.3' href='#vgns35.3'>Verse 35.3</a>He who is at ease with other and no-other;<br>
For whom [both] other, [not] other, are avoid;<br>
He who gives up sensual craving;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.4' href='#vgns35.4'>Verse 35.4</a>He who is meditative, stainless;<br>
Whose deeds are corruption-free;<br>
In whom there does not arise higher seeking;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.5' href='#vgns35.5'>Verse 35.5</a>The sun glows by day;<br>
the moon shines by night;<br>
The warrior shines in the army;<br>
In meditation glows the spiritual cultivator.<br>
The Buddha appears in the world,<br>
Illuminating to dispel darkness everywhere.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.6' href='#vgns35.6'>Verse 35.6</a>One is not a brāhmaṇa on account of the shaven head;<br>
Nor is one a brāhmaṇa because one utters mantras.<br>
It is one who gives up all evil<br>
Whom may be called a spiritual cultivator.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.7' href='#vgns35.7'>Verse 35.7</a>A brāhmaṇa is one who exits from evil;<br>
A brāhmaṇa is one who enters rectitude.<br>
Having renounced one’s own defiled deeds.<br>
One is regarded as having left home.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.8' href='#vgns35.8'>Verse 35.8</a>If one is calmed with regard to the pleasant<br>
And at hearty attaches to naught<br>

One extinguishes all sufferings.</p>

Are pure without any fault;<br>
Who is restrained in this threefold action,<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.10' href='#vgns35.10'>Verse 35.10</a>If your mind understands<br>
The Teachings of the Buddha;<br>
Look into your mind and take refuge in yourself,<br>
[As a brāhmaṇa] purifies himself with water.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.11' href='#vgns35.11'>Verse 35.11</a>Neither on account of clan nor matted hairs.<br>
Is one called a brāhmaṇa<br>
He whose deeds are truthful and righteous,<br>
He is pure, and this makes him a virtuous one.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.12' href='#vgns35.12'>Verse 35.12</a>What for is your contrived hair, witless one!<br>
What for your straw clothes?<br>
When within you remain attached,<br>
What’s the use of external renunciation?</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.13' href='#vgns35.13'>Verse 35.13</a>He who wears poor clothes,<br>
Who personally practices the dharma,<br>
Who meditates on retreat,<br>

<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.14' href='#vgns35.14'>Verse 35.14</a>The Buddha does not teach one<br>
To elevate oneself and make self-claims:<br>
One according with truth, and undeceitful,<br>
May be called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.16' href='#vgns35.16'>Verse 35.16</a>He who has cut off the river of transmigration,<br>
Who has forbearance and transcends [the world],<br>
Who is self-awakened and out of the moats;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.17' href='#vgns35.17'>Verse 35.17</a>He who in the face of being abused and hit,<br>
Endures quietly without anger;<br>
Who has the power of patience;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.18' href='#vgns35.18'>Verse 35.18</a>He who, in the face of being attacked,<br>
Does naught but remains mindful of his precepts;<br>
Who maintains proper postures, self-controlled;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.19' href='#vgns35.19'>Verse 35.19</a>He who abandons evil dharmas in his mind,<br>
Like a snake shedding its skin;<br>
And is not tainted by desire.<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>

And thereby ceases to have [sensual] thoughts;<br>

Who distinguishes the right and wrong paths;<br>
And who has reached the high[est] goal;<br>
Is called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.22' href='#vgns35.22'>Verse 35.22</a>He who can give up the household life,<br>
And has no fear of the household;<br>
Who has few needs and little desire;<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.23' href='#vgns35.23'>Verse 35.23</a>He who frees living things,<br>
Who harbours no thoughts of killing,<br>
Who causes afflictions to no-one,<br>
Is indeed a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.24' href='#vgns35.24'>Verse 35.24</a>He who avoids disputes,<br>
Who resents not when offended,<br>

Such a one is a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.28' href='#vgns35.28'>Verse 35.28</a>One’s deeds being pure in this life,<br>
There can be no defilement in the life after.<br>
[Thus] without practicing any [evil dharmas].<br>
—One is called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.29' href='#vgns35.29'>Verse 35.29</a>Renouncing the body, without a supporting basis,<br>
Not reciting [the doctrines] of other disciplines;<br>
He attains the Deathless Cessation.<br>
Such a one is a brāhmaṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns35.30' href='#vgns35.30'>Verse 35.30</a>He who, with regard to good and evil,<br>
Has got rid of both these deeds,<br>
Free from sorrow and dust,<br>

Fall into the moats to suffer;<br>

Disregarding the words of others.<br>
Only he in whom [birth] ceases and arises no more,<br>
May be called a brāhmaṇa.</p>
