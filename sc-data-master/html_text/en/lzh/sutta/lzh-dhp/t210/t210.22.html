</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.1' href='#vgns22.1'>Verse 22.1</a>Having made the conquest he is not subject to evil,<br>
He is completely victorious over the world;<br>
Saintly wise, and of boundless sphere,<br>
[The Buddha] initiates the ignorant into the Path.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.2' href='#vgns22.2'>Verse 22.2</a>Disentangled from [craving’s] net and unimpeded;<br>
Lust exhausted, amassing nothing;<br>
The Buddha’s mind is profound, without a limit.<br>
He leads those not on the Path to embark on it.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.3' href='#vgns22.3'>Verse 22.3</a>Steadfastly established in one-mindedness,<br>
Left home, in quiescence day and night,<br>
Root cut off, with no lustful thoughts<br>
—[Such are] the awakened ones, the clearly mindful.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.4' href='#vgns22.4'>Verse 22.4</a>He has seen the Truth, and is pure, undefiled,<br>
Having crossed the sea of the five pathways,<br>
—The Buddha—arises, illuminating the world,<br>
In order to remove sufferings.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.5' href='#vgns22.5'>Verse 22.5</a>Difficult it is to be born as a human.<br>
Difficult too the obtaining of longevity for mortals.<br>
Difficult is the arising of Buddhas in the world.<br>
Difficult it is to hear the Buddha-dharma.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.6' href='#vgns22.6'>Verse 22.6</a>I had no one for a master,<br>
Alone, nor had I any companion.<br>
Accumulating one practice I have become a Buddha<br>
By myself I have mastered the Noble Path.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.7' href='#vgns22.7'>Verse 22.7</a>A boatman can cross over water;<br>
Vigour serves as the bridge.<br>
Men are bound by their castes;<br>
He who can cross it is a hero.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.8' href='#vgns22.8'>Verse 22.8</a>Those having destroyed evil and crossed over are the Buddhas.<br>
Those on the land are brahmins.<br>
Those who remove famine are Dharma-trainees.<br>
Those who cut off the caste lineage are disciples.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.9' href='#vgns22.9'>Verse 22.9</a>Of mental devotion, endurance is foremost.<br>
’Nirvāṇa is supreme” say the Buddhas.<br>
He who has left home to be a <i>śramaṇa</i>.<br>
Does no harm to others.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.10' href='#vgns22.10'>Verse 22.10</a>Do not harass by speech or harm;<br>
Restrain fully in accordance with the precepts;<br>
Be moderate in food and give up bodily greed;<br>
Maintain your practice in a secluded abode;<br>
Apply your mind to the gaining of wisdom.<br>
—This is practicing the Buddhas’ teaching.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.11' href='#vgns22.11'>Verse 22.11</a>Not to do evil,<br>
To cultivate all good,<br>
To purify one’s own mind,<br>
—This is the Teaching of the Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.12' href='#vgns22.12'>Verse 22.12</a>[I,] the Buddha am the Exalted One;<br>
[I] have eradicated the cankers and have no lust;<br>
[I] am the hero among the Sakyans;<br>
The whole lot [of gods and men] accords with [my] mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.13' href='#vgns22.13'>Verse 22.13</a>Happy indeed is the result of merit;<br>
Whereby all wishes are fulfilled.<br>
[One with merit] promptly moves to quiescence<br>
And arrives by himself at Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.14' href='#vgns22.14'>Verse 22.14</a>Many go for refuge<br>
To spirits in hills, rivers and trees,<br>
And to images in shrines;<br>
Offering sacrifices and praying for blessings.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.15' href='#vgns22.15'>Verse 22.15</a>Refuges like these<br>
Are neither safe nor supreme.<br>
They cannot come<br>
To deliver us from unsatisfactoriness.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.16' href='#vgns22.16'>Verse 22.16</a>If one goes for refuge<br>
To the Buddha, Dharma and saṅgha;<br>
The virtuous Four Truths;<br>
One will definitely see [with] Right Knowledge:</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.17' href='#vgns22.17'>Verse 22.17</a>[Namely], That saṁsāra is extremely unsatisfactory;<br>
That from [seeing] the Truths one crosses over.<br>
That the Eight-fold Path which transcends existence,<br>
Eradicates all unsatisfactoriness.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.18' href='#vgns22.18'>Verse 22.18</a>Refuge in the Three Treasured Ones,<br>
Is most safe, is supreme;<br>
Only if one has these [refuges]<br>
Can one transcend all unsatisfactoriness.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.19' href='#vgns22.19'>Verse 22.19</a>If a man [accords with] the middle and the proper,<br>
And sets his mind on the Way, without miserliness,<br>
Propitious indeed such a man is,<br>
Who goes for refuge in the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.20' href='#vgns22.20'>Verse 22.20</a>A man of wisdom is hard to encounter,<br>
And he is not to be found everywhere;<br>
Where such a man is born,<br>
The kinsmen are blessed.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns22.21' href='#vgns22.21'>Verse 22.21</a>Happy is the arising of Buddhas.<br>
Happy is the preaching of the Doctrine.<br>
Happy is the unity of the Saṅgha;<br>
Unity brings constant peace.</p>
