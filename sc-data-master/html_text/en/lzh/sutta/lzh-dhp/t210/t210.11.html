<h1>11. Mind</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.1' href='#vgns11.1'>Verse 11.1</a>Mind rushes to echoes,<br>
It is difficult to guard, to restrain.<br>
The wise straightens its base,<br>
And its brightness then becomes great.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.2' href='#vgns11.2'>Verse 11.2</a>[Mind] is fickle, hard to take care of<br>
It complies with every desire.<br>
To subdue the mind is excellent<br>
One’s mind tamed, there will be calm.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.3' href='#vgns11.3'>Verse 11.3</a>[Mind] travels alone, going far off,<br>
It moves according with craving.<br>
The wise always protects his own mind;<br>
When it is guarded, there will be peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.4' href='#vgns11.4'>Verse 11.4</a>[Mind] travels alone, going far off,<br>
Is concealed and incorporeal;<br>
Those who restrain this mind, drawing near the way,<br>
Will be released from Mara’s bonds.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.5' href='#vgns11.5'>Verse 11.5</a>If the mind does not settle down,<br>
Or know the Dharma;<br>
And is deluded in worldly affairs;<br>
There will be no proper understanding.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.6' href='#vgns11.6'>Verse 11.6</a>Thoughts do not stop where they should;<br>
They are ceaseless and endless.<br>
Meritorious actions can halt evil,<br>
He who is aware [of this] is noble.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.7' href='#vgns11.7'>Verse 11.7</a>Though the mental events taught by the Buddha,<br>
Are subtle and not [ultimately] real;<br>
One must beware of the indulgent thoughts,<br>
And not let the mind go as it likes.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.8' href='#vgns11.8'>Verse 11.8</a>Seeing the Dharma, one is happiest;<br>
One’s aims will be fulfilled.<br>
The wise guards the subtle thoughts,<br>
And breaks the causal conditions for suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.9' href='#vgns11.9'>Verse 11.9</a>The body cannot be had for long,<br>
It will return completely to the ground;<br>
Body decayed and consciousness departed<br>
—What can one covet as a boarder therein?</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.10' href='#vgns11.10'>Verse 11.10</a>The mind strives to build dwelling places,<br>
To come and go endlessly.<br>
[If] one’s thoughts are mostly devious,<br>
One incurs troubles for oneself.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.11' href='#vgns11.11'>Verse 11.11</a>It is one’s own mind which causes [suffering]<br>
Not one’s father or mother.<br>
One must then work hard to align with the right,<br>
And not turn back from meritorious actions.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns11.12' href='#vgns11.12'>Verse 11.12</a>Conceal the six [senses] like a tortoise.<br>
Guard the mind like [the army guarding] the capital,<br>
Fight Māra with wisdom;<br>
And if victorious, there will be no more trouble.</p>
