<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.1' href='#vgns15.1'>Verse 15.1</a>He who has completed the Path and is sorrowless,<br>
Who is freed in every way,<br>
Who is released from all bonds,<br>
Is cooled without heat [of passion].</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.2' href='#vgns15.2'>Verse 15.2</a>Those whose mind is pure and are mindful,<br>
Delighting in nowhere;<br>
Have crossed the sea of delusion,<br>
Like swans who have abandoned their lake.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.3' href='#vgns15.3'>Verse 15.3</a>Those who eat according to the stomach’s capacity,<br>
Who accumulate nothing,<br>
Whose mind is empty and markless;<br>
Have passed the various stages of progress<br>
Like the birds in the sky<br>
Which can go far unhindered.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.4' href='#vgns15.4'>Verse 15.4</a>Those who have exhausted the world’s conditioning,<br>
Who are no more hung up with food;<br>
Whose mind is empty and sorrow-free,<br>
Have reached the state of freedom.<br>
They are [unattached] like flying birds<br>
Which land temporarily only to fly away.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.5' href='#vgns15.5'>Verse 15.5</a>He whose senses are controlled, according with calm<br>
Like horses well tamed,<br>
Who has abandoned conceit and the conditioning;<br>
Is respected by the gods.<br>
Without resentment, like the earth;<br>
Immovable, like a mountain;<br>
The true men are taintless,<br>
And have ended the worldly cycle of rebirths.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.7' href='#vgns15.7'>Verse 15.7</a>His mind is already at rest,<br>
His words and deed too are tranquil.<br>
By right understanding he is freed;<br>
Calmly, he goes into appeasement.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.8' href='#vgns15.8'>Verse 15.8</a>He who has given up craving and is detached<br>
Who has broken the hindrances of the three spheres,<br>
And whose desires are annihilated<br>
—Is indeed a superior man.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.9' href='#vgns15.9'>Verse 15.9</a>Be it in village or in forest,<br>
Or on the plains or high lands.<br>
—Wherever the arahats pass by<br>
It cannot but become blessed.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns15.10' href='#vgns15.10'>Verse 15.10</a>He finds delight in the wilderness<br>
Which the worldlings do not;<br>
Happy indeed are the unattached<br>
Who seek no sensual pleasure.</p>
