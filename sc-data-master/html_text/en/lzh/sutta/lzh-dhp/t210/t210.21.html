<h1>21. The World</h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.1' href='#vgns21.1'>Verse 21.1</a>As a cart traveling on the road,<br>
Which, leaving the level, broad road,<br>
Turns onto a small side road and is crashed<br>
—There is the sorrow of the breaking of the axles.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.2' href='#vgns21.2'>Verse 21.2</a>Likewise, leaving the Dharma<br>
To follow and develop that opposed to Dharma,<br>
The fool keeps his way till death<br>
—And there is also the sorrow of being broken.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.3' href='#vgns21.3'>Verse 21.3</a>Fare in accordance with dhamma,<br>
Do not accord with evil deed;<br>
The dharma-farer sleeps well,<br>
And there is no sorrow in every existence.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.4' href='#vgns21.4'>Verse 21.4</a>All things are like foam,<br>
The mind is like a wild horse;<br>
Living in a world like a mirage,<br>
How can one delight in it?</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.5' href='#vgns21.5'>Verse 21.5</a>If one can break away from this,<br>
Cutting the tree at its roots,<br>
And persisting thus day and night,<br>
One will surely achieve concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.6' href='#vgns21.6'>Verse 21.6</a>Some give in accordance with faith,<br>
Like people who are happy;<br>
Others, from a perturbed mind,<br>
Offer food to the [monk-] community<br>
—Such people, day and night<br>
Achieve no mental concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.7' href='#vgns21.7'>Verse 21.7</a>The worldlings have no eyes;<br>
They see not the truth of the Way.<br>
Those with even a little clarity of vision,<br>
Should nurture good thoughts.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.8' href='#vgns21.8'>Verse 21.8</a>Like a goose heading its group,<br>
To fly high in avoidance of the net;<br>
The wise one leads the world,<br>
To get freed from the evil ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.9' href='#vgns21.9'>Verse 21.9</a>All worldlings must die,<br>
There is no security in the three spheres.<br>
Though the gods may enjoy themselves,<br>
They too die when their merit is exhausted.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.10' href='#vgns21.10'>Verse 21.10</a>Observe the worldlings:<br>
No birth does not come to an end.<br>
If one wishes to escape the cycle of rebirth,<br>
One should practice the true Path.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.11' href='#vgns21.11'>Verse 21.11</a>Delusion covers up the whole world;<br>
Greed causes the loss of sight.<br>
False [views] and doubt lead to rejecting Truth.<br>
—The afflicted fool accords with these.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.12' href='#vgns21.12'>Verse 21.12</a>He who has transgressed one dharma,<br>
Namely, the liar,<br>
Will not escape future existence,<br>
And there’s no evil that he will not further do.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.13' href='#vgns21.13'>Verse 21.13</a>Though one may pile up treasure,<br>
To as high as the heavens,<br>
Thus filling up the whole world;<br>
It’s better to gain insight into the Path.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns21.14' href='#vgns21.14'>Verse 21.14</a>What is not good appears to be good,<br>
Lust appears to be not lust;<br>
Suffering is taken for happiness<br>
—The insane is devoted to [these false views].</p>
