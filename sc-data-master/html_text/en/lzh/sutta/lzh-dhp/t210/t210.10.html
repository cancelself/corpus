<h1>10. Heedlessness</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.1' href='#vgns10.1'>Verse 10.1</a>The ethical life is the way to immortality;<br>
Heedlessness is the Path to death.<br>
Those without craving never die;<br>
To lose the Way is to lose one’s life.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.2' href='#vgns10.2'>Verse 10.2</a>The wise excels in guarding the Way<br>
And never becomes heedless.<br>
Not craving, one attains to happiness;<br>
Whence the bliss of attainment is obtained.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.3' href='#vgns10.3'>Verse 10.3</a>One should constantly devote to meditation,<br>
Be firm, and persevere in the proper course.<br>
The strong ones thereby transcend existence,<br>
And [attain Nirvāṇa], the Supremely Auspicious.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.4' href='#vgns10.4'>Verse 10.4</a>One who always gives rise to right mindfulness,<br>
And whose actions are pure;<br>
His evil will be easily eradicated,<br>
Self-restrained, living by Dharma,<br>
Not transgressing, skillful, his name spreads afar.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.5' href='#vgns10.5'>Verse 10.5</a>Bringing forth effort and being heedful,<br>
Restraining himself and taming his mind,<br>
The wise makes an illuminator [for himself],<br>
And does not return to the sea of darkness.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.6' href='#vgns10.6'>Verse 10.6</a>It is difficult to understand the fools’ mind;<br>
It is greedy, scattered and delights in disputes<br>
The intelligent man values caution,<br>
And protects it as his precious wealth.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.7' href='#vgns10.7'>Verse 10.7</a>Do not crave or delight in disputes,<br>
And do not indulge in sensual pleasure.<br>
He who practices meditation and heedfulness,<br>
Can gain great happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.8' href='#vgns10.8'>Verse 10.8</a>To be heedless is like to be self-imprisoned.<br>
He who realizes this is a noble one,<br>
Who has ascended to wisdom’s mansion,<br>
Free from danger, truly safe.<br>
Such a wise man looks down upon the foolish,<br>
Like [one] on the mountain and [the other] on the ground.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.9' href='#vgns10.9'>Verse 10.9</a>Reigning upright amidst the chaotic,<br>
One is uniquely awakened.<br>
Such a man’s power surpasses a lion’s.<br>
Leaving evil, he becomes the Greatly Wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.10' href='#vgns10.10'>Verse 10.10</a>By drowsiness, heavy as a mountain;<br>
The deluded one is covered.<br>
Lying down comfortably, he acknowledges no suffering,<br>
And hence enters the womb again and again.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.11' href='#vgns10.11'>Verse 10.11</a>There can be no occasion for self-indulgence;<br>
He who is well-restrained can exhaust the cankers.<br>
The moment when one indulges, Mara gets his chance,<br>
Like a lion [waiting] to catch the deer.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.12' href='#vgns10.12'>Verse 10.12</a>He who has no self-indulgence,<br>
Is a disciplined <i>bhikṣu</i>.<br>
He, whose thoughts are well calmed<br>
Should constantly guard his mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.13' href='#vgns10.13'>Verse 10.13</a>A bhikshu finds happiness in caution;<br>
Heedlessness gives him much worry.<br>
Changing disputes from small to big,<br>
And accumulating evil, he gets himself into fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.14' href='#vgns10.14'>Verse 10.14</a>Precept observance is meritorious and brings happiness;<br>
Transgressing the precepts produces fear in the heart.<br>
Destroying the cankers of the three spheres.<br>
One comes close to Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.15' href='#vgns10.15'>Verse 10.15</a>If one was heedless earlier,<br>
But regains self-control later<br>
—Such a one illuminates the world.<br>
*Being mindful, he is focused on proper [actions].</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.16' href='#vgns10.16'>Verse 10.16</a>If one made mistakes in doing evil,<br>
But later covers over it by doing good<br>
—Such a one illumines the world.<br>
*Being mindful, he becomes skillful in proper [actions].</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.17' href='#vgns10.17'>Verse 10.17</a>If one abandons the home-life when young and strong<br>
To vigorously practice the Buddha’s teachings<br>
—Such a one illumines the world,<br>
Like the moon freed from clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.18' href='#vgns10.18'>Verse 10.18</a>If one previously had committed evil<br>
But later stops and commits no more;<br>
—Such a one illumines the world,<br>
Like the moon freed from clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.19' href='#vgns10.19'>Verse 10.19</a>He who when living does naught to cause pain,<br>
And at death does not grieve;<br>
Has seen the Truth, and is fearless.<br>
He feels no sorrow where [others] do.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns10.20' href='#vgns10.20'>Verse 10.20</a>He who can eliminate the black dharmas,<br>
And trains only in the pure white ones;<br>
Will cross over deep water, never to return.<br>
He moves about with no attachment,<br>
Unsullied by [sensual] pleasure,<br>
With no craving, and no sorrow.</p>
