<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.1' href='#vgns24.1'>Verse 24.1</a>What contravenes the spiritual life one accords with it;<br>
What accords with the spiritual life one contravenes it;<br>
Leaving the real good one grasps at the pleasant<br>
—Such is according with craving.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.2' href='#vgns24.2'>Verse 24.2</a>Do not seek to be with the beloved<br>
Nor should one have unbeloved.<br>
The meeting with the beloved is painful;<br>
Meeting with the unbeloved is also painful.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.3' href='#vgns24.3'>Verse 24.3</a>Therefore create not any endearment<br>
Affection and hatred originate from evil.<br>
For those who are free from bonds,<br>
There is neither affection nor hatred.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.4' href='#vgns24.4'>Verse 24.4</a>Endearment begets sorrow,<br>
Endearment begets fear<br>
For him free from endearment<br>
Whence sorrow, whence fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.5' href='#vgns24.5'>Verse 24.5</a>Attachment begets sorrow,<br>
Attachment begets fear.<br>
For him free from attachment<br>
Whence sorrow, whence fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.6' href='#vgns24.6'>Verse 24.6</a>Craving bets sorrow,<br>
Craving begets fear.<br>
For him liberated, without craving;<br>
Whence sorrow, whence fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.7' href='#vgns24.7'>Verse 24.7</a>He who desires the Dharma, endowed with virtue,<br>
Who is truthful and shameful,<br>
Who goads himself to be near the Way,<br>
Him do people hold dear.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.8' href='#vgns24.8'>Verse 24.8</a>He who externalizes not his desire state,<br>
Who speaks having first rectified his thoughts,<br>
Whose mind is free from lust;<br>
Will stop the stream and cross over.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.9' href='#vgns24.9'>Verse 24.9</a>As one who has gone on a long journey,<br>
And returns safe from afar;<br>
His kinsfolk are well and happy,<br>
Rejoicing to see him return.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.10' href='#vgns24.10'>Verse 24.10</a>Likewise, he who delights in merit-making,<br>
Having gone from here to there<br>
Will receive the blessing of his merit<br>
Just as kinsmen’s rejoicing in his return.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.11' href='#vgns24.11'>Verse 24.11</a>Rise up and follow the holy teachings,<br>
Restrain from what is unskillful.<br>
When you meet one close to the Way, devote to him;<br>
Do not get close to those away from the Way.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns24.12' href='#vgns24.12'>Verse 24.12</a>Those near the Way and those not,<br>
Will go to different places:<br>
Those near the Way will ascend to heaven;<br>
Those not will fall into hell.</p>
