<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.1' href='#vgns16.1'>Verse 16.1</a>Though one might recite thousand words;<br>
If their meanings be improper,<br>
It’s better to recite one with essential [meaning]<br>
Hearing which thoughts will come to cease.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.2' href='#vgns16.2'>Verse 16.2</a>Though one might recite a thousand chapters;<br>
What’s the use if they be meaningless?<br>
It’s better to recite one with meaning,<br>
Hearing and practicing which one crosses over.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.3' href='#vgns16.3'>Verse 16.3</a>Though one might recite many sūtras,<br>
What’s the use if one does not understand?<br>
[It’s better] to understand one dharma verse,<br>
Practicing which one may attain Enlightenment.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.4' href='#vgns16.4'>Verse 16.4</a>Battling with thousands and thousands of men,<br>
One man might be the victor,<br>
But he who conquers himself is better<br>
He is indeed the greatest in battle.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.5' href='#vgns16.5'>Verse 16.5</a>Best indeed is one who has conquered himself<br>
He is as such called the King of men<br>
Guarding his thoughts and training his self,<br>
He restrains himself till the end.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.6' href='#vgns16.6'>Verse 16.6</a>Even the gods, said to be exalted,<br>
Or demigods or Māra or Brahmā or Śakra,<br>
None of them can defeat<br>
A man who has conquered himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.7' href='#vgns16.7'>Verse 16.7</a>One might each month offer sacrifices by the thousand,<br>
And continue doing so for one’s whole life;<br>
This is not as good as, for a single moment<br>
Recollecting the Dharma with one-mindedness<br>
The merit of one such thought<br>
Excels that of [offering sacrifice] for a whole life.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.8' href='#vgns16.8'>Verse 16.8</a>Though for a whole century,<br>
One might attend to the sacrificial fire;<br>
It’s better, even if for a single moment,<br>
To make offerings to the Three Honoured Ones</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.9' href='#vgns16.9'>Verse 16.9</a>If one offers sacrifice to gods, for the merit’s sake,<br>
And subsequently expects reward from it;<br>
This would not amount to a fourth [the merit]<br>
From paying respect to the virtuous ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.10' href='#vgns16.10'>Verse 16.10</a>In him who properly conforms to etiquette<br>
And always respects the elders,<br>
Four blessings automatically increase;<br>
Beauty, strength, long-life, and happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.11' href='#vgns16.11'>Verse 16.11</a>If one lives a hundred years,<br>
Away from [mental] rectitude and unethical;<br>
It’s better to live a single day<br>
Being ethical, mentally rectified and meditative.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.12' href='#vgns16.12'>Verse 16.12</a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Crooked, insincere and without wisdom;<br>
It’s better to live a single day<br>
With a mind concentrated, acquiring true wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.13' href='#vgns16.13'>Verse 16.13</a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Sluggishly and without diligence;<br>
It’s better to live a single day,<br>
Doing one’s best and with diligence.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.14' href='#vgns16.14'>Verse 16.14</a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Without perceiving the rise and fall of things;<br>
It’s better to live a single day,<br>
Doing’s one’s best and with diligence.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.15' href='#vgns16.15'>Verse 16.15</a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Without seeing the Path of Ambrosia;<br>
It’s better to live a single day<br>
Tasting-practicing-the flavor of Ambrosia.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns16.16' href='#vgns16.16'>Verse 16.16</a>If one lives a hundred years<br>
Without knowledge of Righteousness.<br>
It’s better to live a single day<br>
Studying the essentials of the Buddha’s dharma.</p>
