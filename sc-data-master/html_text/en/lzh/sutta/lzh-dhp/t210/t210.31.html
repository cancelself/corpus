<h1>31. The Elephant Simile</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.1' href='#vgns31.1'>Verse 31.1</a>I, like an elephant in battle<br>
Unafraid of being struck by arrows,<br>
Ever with sincere faith<br>
Transform those without virtues.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.2' href='#vgns31.2'>Verse 31.2</a>Just as a properly trained elephant<br>
Is fit for the king to ride on;<br>
One who is trained is exalted among men<br>
And fit to be believed in.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.3' href='#vgns31.3'>Verse 31.3</a>Even those as properly tamed,<br>
As the thoroughbred horses of Sindh,<br>
And the best elephants;<br>
Cannot escel a man who has tamed himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.4' href='#vgns31.4'>Verse 31.4</a>Those [untrained men] cannot go<br>
To places where men have not been<br>
Only those who have subdued themselves<br>
Can go to the place of the subdued.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.5' href='#vgns31.5'>Verse 31.5</a>Like an elephant named Dhanapālaka,<br>
Who is ferocious and hard to restrain;<br>
Though chianed and not given food<br>
It still remains wild as a rutted elephant.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.6' href='#vgns31.6'>Verse 31.6</a>Those immersed in evil actions,<br>
Ever have themselves chained by greed;<br>
Like the elephant which is insatiable,<br>
And thus repeatedly enter into the womb.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.7' href='#vgns31.7'>Verse 31.7</a>Formerly, the mind has been drifting aimlessly,<br>
And always going where it finds pleasure.<br>
[Now, I] shall give it all up and subdue passions,<br>
Like a mahout subduing an elephant with hooks.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.8' href='#vgns31.8'>Verse 31.8</a>He who delights in the Path and is heedful,<br>
Who can constantly protect his mind<br>
Is one who lifts himself out of suffering;<br>
Like an elephant getting out of a trap.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.9' href='#vgns31.9'>Verse 31.9</a>If you get a capable companion<br>
Who would move with you, and is firm in doing good;<br>
You will defeat all the famous<br>
And remain mindful having attained your Goal.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.10' href='#vgns31.10'>Verse 31.10</a>If you don’t get a capable companion<br>
Who would move with you and is firm in doing good;<br>
Then dissociate from all, [like] a king his lands.<br>
It’s better to be alone without doing evil.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.11' href='#vgns31.11'>Verse 31.11</a>It’s better to move alone, doing good;<br>
And not befriend the fools.<br>
Be alone and do no evil,<br>
Like a frightened elephant protecting itself.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.12' href='#vgns31.12'>Verse 31.12</a>Happiness is to be born with wealth.<br>
Happiness is to have gentle and agreeable friends.<br>
Happiness is having merit at life’s end.<br>
Happiness is not committing any evil.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.13' href='#vgns31.13'>Verse 31.13</a>Happiness is having a mother in the family.<br>
Happiness too is having a father.<br>
Happiness is the existence of <i>śramaṇas</i> in the world.<br>
Happiness is the existence of the Way in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.14' href='#vgns31.14'>Verse 31.14</a>Happiness is practicing virtue till old age.<br>
Good is when one’s faith is pure where it should be pure.<br>
Wisdom delights oneself most.<br>
The greatest is not doing evil.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.15' href='#vgns31.15'>Verse 31.15</a>Just as a horse that is properly trained,<br>
Goes according to the tamer’s wish;<br>
One endowed with faith, virtue, vigour,<br>
Concentration and examination of dharmas,</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.16' href='#vgns31.16'>Verse 31.16</a>Who is established in knowledge and conduct,<br>
Who has patience and mental stability,<br>
Will get rid of all suffering,<br>
In accordance with his wish.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.17' href='#vgns31.17'>Verse 31.17</a>From this, one will go into concentration,<br>
Like a horse having been tamed,<br>
One is freed from anger and the corruptions,<br>
And experiences the bliss of gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns31.18' href='#vgns31.18'>Verse 31.18</a>He who is not heedless<br>
will thereby become more wakeful,<br>
Like a nag compared to a fine horse:<br>
He who gives up evil is the better.</p>
