</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.1' href='#vgns14.1'>Verse 14.1</a>He who deeply examines good and evil,<br>
Knows at heart what to fear and shun.<br>
[Thus] fearing, he does not transgress,<br>
And there is always happiness and no sorrow.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.2' href='#vgns14.2'>Verse 14.2</a>He who has merit from his previous life,<br>
Should mindfully continue his [good] practices.<br>
Goodness brings realization to his wishes,<br>
And his good fortune will increase.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.3' href='#vgns14.3'>Verse 14.3</a>Believe in goodness and make merit.<br>
Be not tired of [accumulating] good practices.<br>
Believe and know that there is effect of good deed,<br>
Eventually, [all] will be clear.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.4' href='#vgns14.4'>Verse 14.4</a>Always avoid [unprofitable] company.<br>
Do not be close to the fools.<br>
Think of following the good friends.<br>
Associate with the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.5' href='#vgns14.5'>Verse 14.5</a>He who finds joy in the Dharma sleeps well,<br>
With a happy and clear mind.<br>
The Dharma expounded by the Noble,<br>
The wise always delight in practicing.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.6' href='#vgns14.6'>Verse 14.6</a>The virtuous and wise ones,<br>
Observe precepts and follow the Way;<br>
Like the moon amidst the stars,<br>
They illumine the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.7' href='#vgns14.7'>Verse 14.7</a>Fletchers shape the horns,<br>
Navigators shape their boats,<br>
Carpenters shape the wood,<br>
The wise ones shape themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.8' href='#vgns14.8'>Verse 14.8</a>Just as a thick rock<br>
Is unmoved by the wind;<br>
The mind of the wise is heavy enough<br>
Not to be upset by praise or blame.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.9' href='#vgns14.9'>Verse 14.9</a>Just as a deep pond<br>
Is limpid and clear;<br>
The wise, having heard the Dharma<br>
Becomes clear in his mind and happy.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.10' href='#vgns14.10'>Verse 14.10</a>The great man has in his nature no craving,<br>
Everywhere he shines forth brightly.<br>
Though encountering now pleasure now pain,<br>
He does not loftily show off his wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.11' href='#vgns14.11'>Verse 14.11</a>The virtuous one has no worldly engagement;<br>
He desires neither sons nor wealth nor land.<br>
Always morally conscious, wise and righteous,<br>
He covets not material success by unjust means.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.12' href='#vgns14.12'>Verse 14.12</a>The wise one knows that when one’s mind wobbles,<br>
It is like a tree planted in sand.<br>
If amidst friends, one’s mind is not yet firm,<br>
One gets tainted in accordance with their colours.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.13' href='#vgns14.13'>Verse 14.13</a>The world is immersed in the sea;<br>
Few cross over to the [other] shore.<br>
If there is anyone<br>
Wishing to cross, he must run fast.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.14' href='#vgns14.14'>Verse 14.14</a>Those who sincerely desire the truth<br>
Accept the True Teaching<br>
—This is being near the Other Shore;<br>
It is best to be liberated from death.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.15' href='#vgns14.15'>Verse 14.15</a>He who cuts off the five aggregates,<br>
Contemplative and wise,<br>
Does not return to the deep sea.<br>
Abandoning clinging—this is being wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.16' href='#vgns14.16'>Verse 14.16</a>He who controls his passions,<br>
Giving up on pleasure, and craving for naught,<br>
Can come to rescue himself<br>
From his sullied mind—this is being wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns14.17' href='#vgns14.17'>Verse 14.17</a>Those who train to obtain right knowledge,<br>
Who contemplate on true Enlightenment,<br>
Who accept Truth with one mind,<br>
Who delight in not grasping,<br>
Whose cankers and conditionings are destroyed<br>
—Such persons have transcended the world.</p>
