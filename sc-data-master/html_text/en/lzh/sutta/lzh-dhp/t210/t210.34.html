Can be free from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.2' href='#vgns34.2'>Verse 34.2</a>Transgress not with hand or foot<br>

<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.5' href='#vgns34.5'>Verse 34.5</a>In training one should not seek gain,<br>

<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.8' href='#vgns34.8'>Verse 34.8</a>All mental and physical objects<br>
Are unreal; don’t be deluded.<br>
He who greives not when they are not near,<br>
Is truly a <i>bhikṣu</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.9' href='#vgns34.9'>Verse 34.9</a><i>Bhikṣu</i>! bail water out from the boat!<br>
When empty within, it becomes light.<br>
When greed hatred and ignorance are removed,<br>
This is Nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.10' href='#vgns34.10'>Verse 34.10</a>Abandon five, cut off five,<br>
And meditate on the five faculties.<br>
He who can analyze the five [fetters]<br>
Thereby crosses over the river.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.11' href='#vgns34.11'>Verse 34.11</a>Meditate without being heedless.<br>
Do not let desires disperse [your mind].<br>
Do not swallow a [red-hot] copper,<br>
And then be vexed at the body being burnt.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.12' href='#vgns34.12'>Verse 34.12</a>There is no meditation for one without wisdom;<br>
No wisdom for one without meditation.<br>

<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.13' href='#vgns34.13'>Verse 34.13</a>One should learn to enter into the empty;<br>

Delight in solitude;<br>
And one-mindedly contemplate on the Dharma.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.14' href='#vgns34.14'>Verse 34.14</a>One should subdue the five skandhas;<br>
And overcome the mind to be like water,<br>
Peaceful and calm,<br>
—This is the taste of ambrosia.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.15' href='#vgns34.15'>Verse 34.15</a>He who accepts not what he [already] has,<br>
—This is a wise <i>bhikṣu</i>.<br>
He is controlled in the senses, and content,<br>
And observes all the disciplinary rules.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.16' href='#vgns34.16'>Verse 34.16</a>Let his life be pure in conduct;<br>
Let him seek spiritual friends;<br>
Let the wise fulfill others’ [need];<br>
[Thereby] transcending suffering to find bliss.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.17' href='#vgns34.17'>Verse 34.17</a>Just like Jasmine flowers,<br>
Which fall off themselves on withering;<br>
When greed, hatred, and ignorance are removed,<br>
Transmigration is automatically transcended.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.18' href='#vgns34.18'>Verse 34.18</a>Calm in body, and speech,<br>
Mind ever remainning quiescent;<br>
A <i>bhikṣu</i> who loathes the worldly<br>
Is said to have experienced tranquility.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.19' href='#vgns34.19'>Verse 34.19</a>One should command one’s body,<br>
And within, struggle with one’s mind.<br>
Guarding his body and mindful of the Truth,<br>
A <i>bhikṣu</i> lives happily.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.20' href='#vgns34.20'>Verse 34.20</a>One is one’s own Self.<br>
The non-existent being reckoned [as real], the self exists.<br>
Therefore subdue the self;<br>
When tamed it will be like a fine [horse].</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.21' href='#vgns34.21'>Verse 34.21</a>[A <i>bhikṣu</i>] joyful in the Buddha’s teaching,<br>
Will, with much joy,<br>
Attain to quiescence,<br>
The cessation of conditionings and eternal bliss.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.22' href='#vgns34.22'>Verse 34.22</a>He who still young practices<br>
In accordance with the Buddha’s Teaching;<br>
Illumines the world,<br>
Like the sun free from clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.23' href='#vgns34.23'>Verse 34.23</a>Completely without conceit and deceit;<br>
Untainted like a lotus in water,<br>
He learns to give up this and that,<br>
knowing this to be the superior way.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.24' href='#vgns34.24'>Verse 34.24</a>Craving removed, without longings,<br>
Not liable to being tainted, like a lotus;<br>
A <i>bhikṣu</i> will thereby cross the river,<br>
*For, desires being conquered understanding arises.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.25' href='#vgns34.25'>Verse 34.25</a>Stop the stream [of desire] and reflect yourself<br>
Turn back your mind from desire,<br>
Unless you cut off desire,<br>
Your one-mindedness will still slip away.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.26' href='#vgns34.26'>Verse 34.26</a>Do it, do it—[persevere];<br>
Control yourself with strength.<br>
If, having left home you get slack,<br>
Your mind will get defiled again.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.27' href='#vgns34.27'>Verse 34.27</a>He who is slack in his practice,<br>
Not ending the tiring thoughts,<br>
Is not living a life of purity<br>
—How then can he reach the Great Gem?</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.28' href='#vgns34.28'>Verse 34.28</a><i>Śramaṇa</i>, where are you going?<br>
If your mind is not controlled,<br>
Step by step you’ll get stuck,<br>
Being dragged on only by [lustful] thoughts.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.29' href='#vgns34.29'>Verse 34.29</a>He who, though with the robe over the shoulders,<br>
Restrains not his evil acts;<br>
He is the worst of evil doers,<br>
And will fall into evil destinies.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.30' href='#vgns34.30'>Verse 34.30</a>[Mind] being untamed, discipline becomes difficult;<br>
One is [helpless] as a rotten tree against the wind.<br>
What one does is for one’s own sake<br>
—So why not strive hard!</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.31' href='#vgns34.31'>Verse 34.31</a>A “ceased-mind” is not one with a shaven head,<br>
While being arrogant and unruly.<br>
Giving up greed and mindful of the Way,<br>
One becomes worthy of being a “ceased-mind’.</p>
<p><a class='ref vgns' id='vgns34.32' href='#vgns34.32'>Verse 34.32</a>A “ceased-mind” is not one [simply] with a shaven head<br>
While being heedless and faithless.<br>
He who can end all sufferings,<br>
Is a superior <i>śramaṇa</i>.</p>
