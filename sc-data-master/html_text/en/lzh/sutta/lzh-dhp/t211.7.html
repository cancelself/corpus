<h1>7. On love or mercifulness (mettā)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref beal' id='beal1' href='#beal1'>Beal 1</a>In old times, Buddha was residing in a country about 500 li from Rājagriha, full of mountains. In these mountains there lived a certain clan of about 122 persons, who occupied themselves in hunting, and fed themselves on the flesh of the animals they killed. [Buddha goes to the place and converts the women, who were left alone during the day, whilst their husbands were hunting, and then adds these lines]:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“He who is humane does not kill (or, it is humane not to kill); he is ever able to preserve (his own?) life. This principle (<i lang='san' translate='no'>chu</i>) is imperishable; whoever observes it, no calamity shall betide that man. Politeness, indifference to worldly things, hurting no one, without place for annoyance—this is the character of the Brahma Heaven (or of Brahma Deva). Ever exercising love towards the infirm; pure, according to the teaching of Buddha; knowing when sufficient has been had; knowing when to stop,—this is to escape (the recurrence of) Birth and Death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[The women, having heard these words, were converted, and on the men's return, although they wished at first to kill Buddha, they were restrained by their wives; and, listening to his words of love, they also were converted]. And then he added these lines:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“There are eleven advantages which attend the man who practises mercifulness, and is tender to all that lives; his body is always in health (happy); he is blessed with peaceful sleep, and when engaged in study he is also composed; he has no evil dreams, he is protected by Heaven (Devas), and loved by men; he is unmolested by poisonous things, and escapes the violence of war; he is unharmed by fire or water; he is successful wherever he lives, and when dead goes to the heaven of Brahma. These are the eleven.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having uttered these words, both men and women were admitted into the company of his disciples, and obtained rest.</p>
<p><a class='ref beal' id='beal2' href='#beal2'>Beal 2</a>There was, in times gone by, a certain mighty king, called Ho-meh <span class='add'>(love-darkness)</span>, who ruled in a certain district where no tidings of Buddha or his merciful doctrine had yet been heard; but the religious practices were the usual ones of sacrifice and prayer to the gods for protection. Now it happened that the king's mother being sick, the physicians having vainly tried their medicines, all the wise men were called to consult as to the best means of restoring her to health. After several years, during which she did not improve, the Queen mother sent for 200 celebrated Brahmans, and desired them to exercise their supernatural arts in discovering from the sun, moon, and stars a way of recovery. These Brahmans replied: “It is useless so to do, as the heavenly signs are in opposition and not favourable.” On the King asking them what should be done, they replied, “Outside the city there should be selected a convenient place, level and plane, and without pollution, and sacrifices of a hundred beasts of different kinds should be offered on the four hills (or to the four quarters), the sun, moon, and stars, with a young child as a crowning oblation to Heaven. Then the King in his own person, with his mother, going to this place to participate in the sacrifice, the stars and heavenly bodies may be propitiated. [On this Buddha, moved with compassion, came to the spot, and preached a sermon on “Love to all that lives,” and added these words]:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“If a man lives a hundred years, and engages the whole of his time and attention in religious offerings to the gods, sacrificing elephants and horses, and other things, all this is not equal to one act of pure love in saving life.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[In consequence of this sermon and the exhibition of the glorious body of Buddha, they were converted, and became disciples.]</p>
