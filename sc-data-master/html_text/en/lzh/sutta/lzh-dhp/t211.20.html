<h1>20. Loving the body (self) (attavaggo)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref beal' id='beal1' href='#beal1'>Beal 1</a>In old time there was a country called To-mo-ho-lo (Damakara?), and about seven lis from the (chief) city there was a Vihāra, in which dwelt 500 Shamans. Amongst these was an aged mendicant named Mo-ho-lu (Makhara?), who, being of a heavy and dull mind, was unable to learn even one Gāthā, though instructed by the 500 Shamans through many years. On this he was treated contemptuously by the rest, and not allowed to go in their company, but left to sweep the monastery, and look after the cells of the monks. On one occasion the King of the country had asked all the Shamans to assemble at his palace, and accept his hospitality. On this occasion, Makhara, having been left behind as usual, he thought thus with himself—"I have been born dull and stupid, and cannot even recollect one verse of Scripture. What use is it to live any longer, to be neglected and despised by my fellow-men?” On this he took a rope, and going to the back of the garden, he placed himself under a great tree intending to hang himself. At this time Buddha, by his power of religious discernment (eyes of religion), seeing the case of this man, transformed himself at once into the appearance of the Tree-Spirit, and with half his body projecting from the tree, addressed the old monk in these words of expostulation—"Psha! psha! thou (foolish) mendicant, what art thou going to do?” On this Makhara opened out the cause of his grief; on which the Tree-Spirit continued and said—"Do no such thing as this, but listen to my words: In the time of Kāsyapa Buddha, long ago, you were then a Shaman deeply acquainted with the three books <span class='add'>(baskets—i.e., Pitakas)</span>, and among your 500 brethren you were pre-eminent, in consequence of which you were filled with pride and self-complacency, and despised all others on account of their ignorance; and because you died then without repentance, it has been your lot ever since to be born dull and stupid—what good, then, to destroy yourself?”<br>
And then Buddha, appearing in all his glory, added these verses :—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“If a man love himself, let him carefully protect that which he is so anxious about <span class='add'>(i.e., himself)</span>. If he hope to be delivered from carnal desire, let him learn the right way without indolence (sleep). Himself, this is the first consideration; let him put forth his own power and attain wisdom. Profiting (himself in this way), he may then instruct others. Unwearied in his efforts, he will then gain wisdom. The enlightened man will first govern himself, then in due time he will be able to govern others. Regulating his own conduct (himself), and entering (on the domain of) true wisdom, he must necessarily ascend to the highest place <span class='add'>(i.e., become eminent)</span>. But if one cannot improve (profit) oneself, how can such an one benefit others; and, on the other hand, what desire (vow) may not be accomplished when oneself is able to lord it rightly over oneself? That which I now do in my body, hereafter shall I myself receive; if I do evil, myself will cause the more, as the steel drill bores the gem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makhara, on hearing these words, and seeing the glory of Buddha's appearance, immediately fell at his feet in worship, and was able to attain to peace. Moreover Buddha directed him to repair to the King's palace; and having preached there, he became a Rahat. [And the King and his ministers, etc., entered on the Paths.]</p>
<p><a class='ref beal' id='beal2' href='#beal2'>Beal 2</a>In days of old, when Buddha was residing at Śrāvastī, there were 500 Brahmans who continually sought to bring some railing accusation against him. Buddha, by his divine sight, penetrating their intention, and being moved by compassion towards them, desired to bring them to a knowledge of the truth. They had arranged between themselves to persuade a butcher to ask Buddha to receive his hospitality, and then, whilst he was there, to cause the slaughter of different creatures around him, so that in condemning slaughter, he must of necessity condemn his host, or, in praising his host, he must condone the slaughter. Then Buddha, having accepted his host's invitation, addressed him thus—"When the fruit is ripe it will fall of itself, so when merit is ripe, it will of itself exhibit itself (produce salvation).” Then the butcher, returning to his house, made all necessary preparations for the entertainment. At the appointed time Buddha arrived, and having mounted the preaching throne, he was moved by a strong desire to bring about the conversion of the Brahmans, and those assembled with them; and perfectly knowing their hearts, he began by causing his tongue to cover his face, and his glory to appear through the whole city; and then he uttered the following stanzas:—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The teaching of the wise is this, that by wisdom we preserve ourselves. The foolish ridicule it—they see, and yet do wickedly; and so by their wicked deeds they reap misfortune, as he who sows the noxious plant (reaps the same). The wicked man in his own person accumulates (receives the fruit of his) guilt; the good man reaps good fruit (merit) in his own person; and so each one for himself prepares the harvest for himself. The concerns of another do not effect one's case—doing good, then we reap good, just as one who sows that which is sweet (enjoys the same).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On hearing these words, the Brahmans were convinced of their folly, and became disciples. The butcher also and his associates were converted, and then the All-Wise returned to the Vihāra.</p>
