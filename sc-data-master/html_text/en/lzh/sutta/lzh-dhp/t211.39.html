<h1>39. Good fortune (mahāmangala)</h1>
</header>
<p>When Buddha was residing in the Gridhrakūta Mountain, near Rājagriha, preaching for the benefit of Devas and men, there was residing on the banks of the Ganges a certain Brahmachārin, belonging to the Nirgrantha sect, of considerable age and vast wisdom. This man, with his 500 followers, devoted himself to the study of the stars and heavenly bodies, with a view to predict lucky and unlucky events. On one occasion, just before Buddha had commenced his public ministry, this man, with his disciples, were discussing the question of “good fortune,” as they sat by the river's side; and after explaining in what good fortune consisted, so far as it concerned the happiness of a prince in his worldly empire, the question arose as to what “good fortune" was when considered in reference to the future. After much discussion, they resolved to go to the Bōdhi Tree, where the World-honoured had just overcome Māra, and put this question to him. What is the secret of real “good fortune"? On which the Master opened his mouth and repeated these lines :—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Buddha, the Honoured above all gods, Tathāgata, the ever-wise and intelligent, is asked by the learned sages of the Brahmachārin sect in what consists the enjoyment of good fortune. On this Buddha, the compassionate, for their sake enunciates true wisdom. He who has faith, and delights in the true Law, this man is fortunate above all others. He who looks for good luck neither from gods or sacrifices to spirits (but from himself) is truly fortunate. A friend of the virtuous, and holding with the righteous, always making the consideration of virtue his first aim, keeping his body in strict obedience to the rules of propriety, this man is fortunate indeed! Avoiding bad people and following the good, giving up wine, and using strict moderation in all personal gratification, not lusting after female beauty, this man is indeed a fortunate one. Ever anxious to listen to the rules of right conduct, persevering in the study of the Law and Rules of Discipline (Dharma and Vinaya), self-restrained and without offence, this man is fortunate above all. If a householder, then caring; for his father and mother, and looking after the welfare of his house, and properly fostering his wife and child, not occupying himself in vain and useless avocations, this man is indeed fortunate. Not giving way to idleness or self-honour, knowing the character of moderation (as to himself), and thoughtful of his friends, at proper times reading the Scriptures and practising (himself in them), this man is truly fortunate. Patiently continuing in the way of duty (of what he hears he ought to do), rejoicing to see a religious person (Shaman), and ever inviting such an one to instruct him in religion, this man is happy. Observing the religious seasons (fasts), and during such seasons using strict self-abstinence, always desiring to see the virtuous and holy man, placing his confidence in the instruction of the enlightened, this man is fortunate. Once convinced of the happiness of religion (Bōdhi), then with upright heart never swerving from his faith, desiring above all things to escape the three evil ways (of birth), this man is truly happy. With equal mind, devoting himself to charity, honouring all the wise alike, and paying respect to the Divine Spirits, this man is indeed happy. Always anxious to get rid of sensual desires and covetousness, to escape from delusive thoughts, ignorance, and anger, ever constant in the pursuit of true wisdom, this man is indeed fortunate. Even in discarding the evil using no extraordinary appearance of effort, but steadily persevering in the practice of what is right, always acting as he ought to act, this man is fortunate indeed. Full of love for all things in the world, practising virtue in order to benefit others, this man alone is happy. The wise man dwelling in the world, pursuing this line of fortunate behaviour with constancy, ever pressing onwards to complete what knowledge he has gained, this is a happy man indeed.”</p>

<p>The Brahmachārin, having heard the instruction of Buddha, felt his heart full of joy; immediately he arose and worshipped, and took refuge in Buddha, the Law, and the Church.<br>
The Nirgrantha and his followers, having heard these words, were very glad, and after due worship they obtained permission to become Shamans, and soon obtained inward illumination (the eyes of the Law).</p>
