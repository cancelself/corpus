<h1>35. The brahmachārin</h1>
</header>
<p>In days of old, in a certain mountain (called Sse-yau-chu-to) in the country of Saketa (Sse-ho-teh), there were resident some 500 Brahmans who pretended to have arrived at final release (Nirvāna), in consideration of their miraculous powers (irrdhi). Now at this time Buddha, having just arrived at complete enlightenment, and beginning to sound the drum of the law, and open the doors of immortality, was induced, on account of these Brahmachārins, to come into their neighbourhood, and sitting beneath a tree, to reveal the splendour of his person. After some conversation with them, he repeated these verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Stem the stream and pass over, without desire as a Brahman! Understanding the end of all that is made (or, of all modes of conduct), this is truly named (the life of a) Brahmachārin. In (or, by means of) the two laws of nothingness, pure and spotless passing over the gulf, casting off all the bonds of desire, this is to be a Brahmachārin (indeed). It is not by his clan, or his platted hair, that a man is called a Brahman, but he who walks truthfully and righteously, he is indeed rightly called a good man (Bhadra). What avails the platted hair, O fool! the garment of grass, what good? Within there is no quittance of desire, then what advantage the outward denial of self? Put away lust, hatred, delusion, sloth and all its evil consequences, as the snake puts off its skin, this is to be a Brahmachārin indeed. Separate yourself from all worldly associations—let the mouth speak no foul words—thoroughly investigate the eight paths (Ashtānga mārga), this is to be a Brahmachārin indeed. To have cast off all thoughts of family affection, to have given up all desire after home, and all the bonds of personal preference loosed, this is to be a Brahmachārin indeed. He who has given up all thoughts about this world or the next, and places no reliance on either—this man is a Brahmachārin indeed. He who understands his own previous history, and has come to an end of all future chance of birth or death, him I call a Brahmachārin. He who is perfect in knowledge, is a Brahmachārin.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having thus spoken, Buddha addressed the Brahmachārins in these words:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“You who profess to have arrived at Nirvāna, are but as fishes in a pool of shallow water! What pleasure or satisfaction can you expect?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Brahmachārins having heard these words and considered them, bowed down before Buddha, and having been admitted into his community, soon became Rahats. The other hearers, also filled with joy, were enabled to enter the Paths.</p>
