<h1>13. The fool (balavaggo)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref beal' id='beal1' href='#beal1'>Beal 1</a>On a certain occasion, when Buddha was residing at Śrāvastī, there was a certain rich Brahman, eighty years old, who had built himself a large house, in ignorance of the impermanency of earthly things, in prospect of a long life. Buddha sent Ānanda to this man, and knowing that his death was near, he inquired why he had built such a house with so many apartments; and on the man giving his reasons, and explaining the several purposes of the numerous chambers, then the World-honoured repeated these gāthās:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“I have children and wealth, such is the constant thought of the fool. He is not even his own master (or, himself)—what, then, are his children and his money? If it is hot, it will be so; if it is cold, it will be so. Many are the anxieties of the foolish man, but yet he knows nothing of the changes of the future. The fool who knows not his extreme folly yet claims knowledge; the fool who says he is wise is foolish indeed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the old man returning to his dwelling, he suddenly fell dead from a blow received as he walked, on which Buddha repaired to the place, and for the sake of the other Brahmans recited these verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“A fool, though he live in the company of the wise, understands nothing of the true doctrine, as a spoon tastes not the flavour of the soup. The man of discernment, frequenting the society of the wise, in a moment perceives the secret of the true doctrine, as the tongue perceives the flavour of the broth. Even the charity of the fool is a cause of sorrow to him; how much more his evil deeds! That deed is ill done that causes repentance here-after; the reward of which is accompanied by tears and a rueful face.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On hearing these lines the Brahmachārins were converted, and worshipping Buddha, arose and departed.<br>
On another occasion, when a Pratyeka Buddha, called Kāla, entered Nirvāna, after enduring the insults of certain women as he begged his food, the World-honoured uttered these verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The fool and his fellows doing evil are unable to deliver themselves. Misfortune follows them with its certain burning. Their evil deeds must result, when they are completed, in entire destruction. The fool, whilst in the flesh, recognises not the misery he is entailing on himself; but when he sinks into the place of perdition, then he knows his own folly."</p>
