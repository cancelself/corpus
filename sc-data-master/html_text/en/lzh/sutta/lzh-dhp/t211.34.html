<h1>34. The shaman (bhikkhuvaggo)</h1>
</header>
<p>In days of old, when Buddha was residing in the Jetavana Vihāra, near Śrāvastī, preaching his doctrine for the sake of Devas and men, there was a certain Bhikshu, young in years, who used every morning to assume his robe, and take his mendicant's staff and begging-dish, and go through the streets of the town begging his food. On the way there was a certain nobleman's garden, on the outside part of which were sown certain esculant plants, and the ground guarded by a contrivance for discharging arrows at whatever beast, or thief, came there to trespass or steal. Moreover, as guardian of the ground, there was a girl of tender age left, who used to warn travellers away from the place if they had missed their way, or were likely to trespass on the field without knowing the danger, lest they should be shot.<br>
Now it came to pass that on one occasion the Bhikshu, having gone his round through the city, was returning homewards, when, on passing the spot, he heard the plaintive alarm of the girl as she sang out to him to beware; and his passions being roused thereby, he thought to go in and hold some conversation with her, and amuse himself. While assaying to do this he was filled with sudden fear, he let his staff fall, and his robes were disordered, and his alms-dish disarranged; when Buddha, by his divine sight, seeing how the case stood, and that in a moment or two the Bhikshu would be pierced by the arrows, and so perish in his sin, transformed himself into a white-robed layman, and standing by the side of the Bhikshu, repeated these expostulatory stanzas:—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Shaman! whither goest thou? unguarded in the workings of thought. Step by step becoming more immersed in the slough, as you follow your evil purpose. Disgrace not your robes by such evil conduct as you purpose! Death stares you in the face as you go forward! Stem the stream (of inclination), pause and reflect, trample down the lustful desire. A man who does not destroy desire is led on by one thought alone (to do this and that, till he destroys and ruins himself). Be up then, and dare to do! Bind thyself fast. The man who has left home (to become a Shaman), and yet gives way to idleness and sloth—whose mind still hankers after impure indulgence—is like the rotten tree against which the wind blows, which can hardly resist its force, but is soon blown down.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Buddha, having assumed his glorious appearance, the Bhikshu, ashamed of his weakness, fell down at the master's feet, and, deeply repenting, soon became a Rahat; and countless others who heard the circumstances, belonging to the Vihāra, received divine illumination.</p>
