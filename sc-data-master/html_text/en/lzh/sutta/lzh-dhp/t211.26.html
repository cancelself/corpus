<h1>26. Impurity (malavaggo)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref beal' id='beal1' href='#beal1'>Beal 1</a>There was once a man who had no brothers, but only one little son, who was much beloved by both his parents. They procured for him means of instruction, and fondly hoped that he would be an honour to their house. But, alas! he was careless and negligent, and learned nothing. In consequence of this his parents took him to their home, and hoped he would be useful in the management of the house. But he was idle and dirty in his ways, and altogether a grief to them. In consequence of this he was slighted by all the neighbours, and became an object of contempt amongst his friends, and almost hateful to his parents. Deeply touched by this, he sought some comfort in religious exercises, but found no help in all his penances and prayers to the gods. At last, hearing that Buddha was the all-wise Teacher who could meet the necessities of his case, he came to him and begged his help. To whom Buddha replied, “If you would find comfort in my society, the first thing for you to learn is purity of conduct. Go back, therefore, to your home, and learn to obey your parents, recite your prayers, be diligent in your daily occupations, let no love of ease tempt you to neglect cleanliness of person or decency of dress; and then, having learned this, come back to me, and you may perhaps be allowed to enter into the companionship of my followers.” And then the World-honoured added these stanzas:—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Absence of (daily) prayer is the disease of (daily) conversation (words). Want of diligence is the disease of a household. Want of becoming dignity is the disease of manner (outward appearance). Carelessness is the disease of business. Stinginess is the disease of charity. Vice is the disease of daily conduct. Both now and hereafter an evil Rule of Life (Law) is an everlasting disease (taint). But the disease of all diseases, than which none is worse, is ignorance. He who is wise (enlightened) should free himself from this. Then, O Bhikshus! there is no disease.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The man having heard these words, and perceiving that ignorance (in the sense of “folly,” or “infatuation") was at the bottom of all his misfortunes, returned to his father's house, and gave himself up to obey and to work; he paid respect to his teacher, and was constant in the recitation of the Scriptures, and in all respects ordered his life diligently and circumspectly, and after three years returned to Buddha, and having paid homage to him, related how he had changed his life, and now besought admission into his society. On this the World-honoured One addressed him in these words, “Welcome, youth!” and at once, his hair falling off, he became a Shaman, and by an inward effort of mind arrived at a knowledge of the four truths, and became after a day's perseverance a complete Rahat.</p>
