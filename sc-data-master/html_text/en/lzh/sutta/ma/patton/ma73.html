  <h1>The Gods</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha traveled to Cedi and stayed at Waterside Grove.</p>
<h3>1. Purifying Knowledge and Vision</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “Before I had awakened to the unsurpassed and correct awakening, I had the thought, ‘I’d like to be able to produce their light. As a result of their light, I’ll see shapes and forms. Thus, my knowledge and vision will be fully and radiantly purified.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“In order for knowledge and vision to be fully and radiantly purified, I lived alone in seclusion, my mind wasn’t careless, and I cultivated diligence. As a result of living alone in seclusion, not being careless, and cultivating diligence, I apprehended light and then saw forms. That was before I had met with those gods, before we exchanged greetings, before any conversation, and before any reply.</p>
<h3>2. Meeting and Conversing with Gods</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Again, I thought, ‘I’d like to be able to produce their light. As a result of their light, then I’ll see shapes and forms.

I also met with those gods, exchanged greetings, and had some conversation and received some replies from them. Still, I didn’t know about the clans, names, or births of those gods.</p>
<h3>3. The Names and Births of Gods</h3>

<h3>4. The Food and Experiences of Gods</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Again, I thought, ‘I’d like to be able to produce their light. As a result of their light, then I’ll see shapes and forms.

<h3>5. The Life Spans of Gods</h3>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“If I didn’t rightly know and apprehend these eight practices, then I couldn’t thoroughly declare their attainment. I wouldn’t know that I had awakened to the unsurpassed and correct awakening, nor could I have gone beyond this world’s gods, Māra, Brahmā, ascetics, and priests. I wouldn’t have been liberated by various liberations. I wasn’t yet free from delusions. I also wouldn’t have ended birth, established the religious practice, or accomplished the task, or truly known that I had stopped being subject to existence.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
