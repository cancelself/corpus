  <h1>The Rock Salt Parable</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to the country of Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that the Bhagavān addressed the monks, “According to the deeds that they perform, a person receives their rewards. Thus, not practicing the religious life, they don’t attain the end of suffering.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Why is that? Suppose someone performs a deed that’s not good and will surely receive a painful result, the reward of Hell. How does a person perform a deed that’s not good and will surely receive a painful result, the reward of Hell? It means that this person hasn’t cultivated themselves. They haven’t cultivated the precepts, haven’t cultivated their mind, and haven’t cultivated wisdom. Their life span will be very short. This is called a person who performs a deed that’s not good and will surely receive a painful result, the reward of Hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“It’s like a person who tosses a couple salt rocks into a little water wanting to make the water too salty to drink. What do you think? Can those salt rocks make the water too salty to drink?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The monks answered, “Yes, Bhagavān. Why is that? Those salt rocks are larger, and the water is smaller, so they can make the water too salty to drink.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“So it is with someone who performs a deed that’s not good and will surely receive a painful result, the reward of Hell.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“It’s like a person who tosses a couple salt rocks into the Gaṅgā River wanting to make the water too salty to drink. What do you think? Can those salt rocks make the Gaṅgā River too salty to drink?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The monks answered, “No, Bhagavān. Why is that? The Gaṅgā River is larger, and a couple salt rocks are smaller, so they cannot make it too salty to drink.”</p>
