<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: One time, the Buddha traveled to <span class='add'>[Ugracelā]</span> and stayed on the shore of Gaṅgā Lake.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>It was then that a monk rose from sitting in reflection in the afternoon and went to the Buddha. He bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, withdrew to sit to one side. He said, “Bhagavān, please teach me the essentials of the Dharma. After hearing the teaching from the Bhagavān, I’ll live alone in seclusion, my mind won’t be careless, and I’ll cultivate diligence. As a result of living alone in seclusion, not being careless, and cultivating diligence, I’ll become a clansman who shaves off his beard and hair, puts on the reddish-brown robes, becomes faithful, leaves home, goes homeless, and trains on the path. When the unsurpassed religious practice is finished, then I’ll accomplish and dwell in my own knowledge, perception, and realization: ‘Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, the task has been accomplished. I truly know that I’m no longer subject to existence.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Bhagavān told him, “Monk, you should thus train: ‘Let my mind abide in an inner and unperturbed cultivation of measureless goodness.’ Again, contemplate the inner body as body, applying the utmost diligence. Establishing right mindfulness and right knowledge, well steer your own mind; make it free of greed and without grief.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Again, contemplate the outer body as body, applying the utmost diligence. Establishing right mindfulness and right knowledge, well steer your own mind; make it free of greed and without grief.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Again, contemplate the inner and outer body as body, applying the utmost diligence. Establishing right mindfulness and right knowledge, well steer your own mind; make it free of greed and without grief.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Monk, as you come and go according to these samādhis, cultivate goodness. While you’re standing, sitting, lying down, asleep, awake, and waking up, you should also cultivate it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Furthermore, you should cultivate samādhi with perception and examination, samādhi with no perception and some examination, and samādhi without perception or examination. You should also cultivate samādhi together with joy, samādhi together with happiness, samādhi together with samādhi, and samādhi together with equanimity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Monk, suppose you cultivate these samādhis and the utmost goodness. Monk, you should again contemplate inner feelings as feelings, applying the utmost diligence. Establishing right mindfulness and right knowledge, well steer your own mind; make it free of greed and without grief.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Monk, as you come and go according to these samādhis, cultivate goodness. While you’re standing, sitting, lying down, asleep, awake, and waking up, you should also cultivate it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Furthermore, you should cultivate samādhi with perception and examination, samādhi with no perception and some examination, and samādhi without perception or examination. You should also cultivate samādhi together with joy, samādhi together with happiness, samādhi together with samādhi, and samādhi together with equanimity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Monk, suppose you cultivate these samādhis and the utmost goodness.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Furthermore, you should cultivate samādhi with perception and examination, samādhi with no perception and some examination, and samādhi without perception or examination. You should also cultivate samādhi together with joy, samādhi together with happiness, samādhi together with samādhi, and samādhi together with equanimity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Monk, suppose you cultivate these samādhis and the utmost goodness. Monk, you should again contemplate inner principles as principles, applying the utmost diligence. Establishing right mindfulness and right knowledge, well steer your own mind; make it free of greed and without grief.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“Again, contemplate outer principles as principles, applying the utmost diligence. Establishing right mindfulness and right knowledge, well steer your own mind; make it free of greed and without grief.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“Again, contemplate inner and outer principles as principles, applying the utmost diligence. Establishing right mindfulness and right knowledge, well steer your own mind; make it free of greed and without grief.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“Monk, as you come and go according to these samādhis, cultivate goodness. While you’re standing, sitting, lying down, asleep, awake, and waking up, you should also cultivate it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“Furthermore, you should cultivate samādhi with perception and examination, samādhi with no perception and some examination, and samādhi without perception or examination. You should also cultivate samādhi together with joy, samādhi together with happiness, samādhi together with samādhi, and samādhi together with equanimity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“Monk, suppose someone cultivates these samādhis of utmost goodness. Monk, they accomplish and dwell in one direction pervaded with mind and kindness. They do this in two, three, and four directions, the four counterpoints, up, and down, pervading everywhere with their mind and kindness. Having no bonds, enmity, anger, or quarrel, they accomplish and dwell in pervading the whole world, <span class='add'>[their mind being]</span> broad and vast, measureless, and well cultivated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“So it is with compassion, joy, and equanimity. Having no bonds, enmity, anger, or quarrel, they accomplish and dwell in pervading the whole world, <span class='add'>[their mind being]</span> broad and vast, measureless, and well cultivated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“Monk, suppose you cultivate these samādhis of utmost goodness. If you travel east, you’ll surely attain well-being and not have any distress. If you travel south, west, or north, you’ll surely attain well-being and not have any distress. Monk, if you cultivate these samādhis and the utmost goodness, then even if I did not say you abide in good qualities, how could I say they would decline? Day and night, those good qualities will only grow and not decline.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“Monk, if you cultivate these samādhis of utmost goodness, you’ll surely attain one of two fruits. You might attain ultimate knowledge in the present life, or you might instead become a non-returner with some remainder.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>Hearing what the Buddha taught, that monk well accepted and well retained it. He then rose from his seat, bowed his head at the Buddha’s feet, circled him three times, and left. Having accepted and retained the Buddha’s instructions, he went to live alone in seclusion, his mind wasn’t careless, and he cultivated diligence. As a result of living alone in seclusion, not being careless, and cultivating diligence, he became a clansman. He shaved off his beard and hair, put on the reddish-brown robes, became faithful, left home, went homeless, and trained on the path.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>It was only when the unsurpassed religious practice was finished that he accomplished and dwelt in his own knowledge, perception, and realization: ‘Birth has been ended, the religious practice has been established, the task has been accomplished. I truly know that I’m no longer subject to existence.’ After knowing the Dharma, that venerable became an arhat.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>The Buddha spoke thus. Those monks who heard what the Buddha taught rejoiced and approved.</p>
