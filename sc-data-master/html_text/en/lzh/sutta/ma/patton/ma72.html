  <h1>The Legend of King Dīrghāyu</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Thus have I heard: One time, the Buddha traveled to Kauśāmbī and stayed at Ghoṣila Park.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At the time, the Kauśāmbī monks were having numerous quarrels with each other. The Bhagavān told the Kauśāmbī monks, “Monks, don’t quarrel with each other. Why is that?</p>

<p>{:.verse #v1} “If you end disputes with disputes,  <br>
There won’t ever be an end to them.  <br>
Only tolerance can end disputes;  <br>
This is a law that’s venerable.</p>

<h3>The Legend of King Dīrghāyu</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Why is that? Once in the past, the king of Kośala was named Dīrghāyu, and the king of Kāsi was named Brahmadatta. Those two kings were constantly at war with each other.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Brahmadatta, the king of Kāsi, raised a fourfold army of elephant troops, horse troops, chariot troops, and foot troops. Having raised a fourfold army, King Brahmadatta led his army, going to war with Dīrghāyu, the king of Kośala.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“King Dīrghāyu heard this: ‘Brahmadatta, the king of Kāsi, has raised a fourfold army. Having raised that fourfold army, he is coming to make war on us.’ After hearing this, King Dīrghāyu also raised a fourfold army. Having raised that fourfold army, King Dīrghāyu led his army to the border, arrayed them for battle, and then destroyed Brahmadatta’s army.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Thereupon, King Dīrghāyu captured that King Brahmadatta’s entire fourfold army. Moreover, he captured King Brahmadatta himself. After being captured, he was released. Dīrghāyu told him, ‘You’re an unfortunate man, so now I’ll give you amnesty. Don’t do this again.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“King Brahmadatta went on to raise a fourfold army three more times. After raising a fourfold army, he would lead his army to make war on King Dīrghāyu. King Dīrghāyu would hear: ‘Brahmadatta, the king of Kāsi, has once again raised a fourfold army. Having raised that fourfold army, he is coming to make war on us.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“After hearing this <span class='add'>[for a third time]</span>, King Dīrghāyu then thought, ‘I’ve already beaten him. What need is there to beat him again? I’ve already defeated him. What satisfaction would there be in defeating him again? I’ve already hurt him. What need is there to hurt him again? Only an empty bow is enough to defeat him.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“After thinking this, it was clear as day to King Dīrghāyu, and he didn’t raise another fourfold army, nor did he leave. Thereupon, King Brahmadatta came and defeated him, capturing King Dīrghāyu’s entire fourfold army.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“King Dīrghāyu then heard: ‘Brahmadatta, the king of Kāsi, has captured our entire fourfold army.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Again, he thought, ‘How strange battle is! How evil battle is! Why is that? Those beaten go on to beat others, those defeated go on to defeat <span class='add'>[others]</span>, and those hurt go on to hurt others. Now, I’d rather just go alone with a single wife to the city of Bārāṇasī, riding with her in a single chariot.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“King Dīrghāyu then went alone with a single wife, and they rode together in a single chariot to Bārāṇasī. King Dīrghāyu again thought, ‘Now, I’d rather go to the villages and towns where I can study and learn broadly.’ After thinking this, King Dīrghāyu then went to villages and towns, studying and learning broadly. He became known as ‘Dīrghāyu the Scholar’ because of his broad learning.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Dīrghāyu the Scholar again thought, ‘I’ve learned what there was to learn. Now, I’d rather go to Bārāṇasī and stand on the streets and in the markets as an entertainer with a cheerful expression. Thus, after they listen to me, the well-to-do families of Bārāṇasī will be happier and amuse themselves.’ After thinking this, King Dīrghāyu went into Bārāṇasī and stood on the streets and in the markets as an entertainer with a cheerful expression. Thus, after they heard him, the well-to-do families of Bārāṇasī were happier and amused themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Thereupon, King Brahmadatta’s outer retinue heard about him, as did the middle retinue and inner retinue. The kingdom’s head priest in turn also heard about him. After hearing of him, the head priest then asked for a meeting.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Dīrghāyu the Scholar visited the kingdom’s head priest and stood before him as an entertainer with a cheerful expression. After listening to him, the head priest was happier and amused himself. The head priest then told Dīrghāyu the scholar, ‘Starting today, you may make use of my home. We should support each other.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Dīrghāyu the Scholar said, ‘Venerable, I have a wife. What about her?’</p>
<p>“The head priest responded, ‘Scholar, you can tell her to come and make use of my family’s home. We’ll support her, too.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Dīrghāyu the Scholar then sent for his wife to make use of the head priest’s home, and the head priest supported them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Later, Dīrghāyu’s wife felt sad and thought, ‘The fourfold army will be arrayed in formation with their armor and shields. They’ll draw their autumn swords and march serenely by. I want to watch it all, and I also want to drink the water from the sharpening of their blades.’  After thinking this, Dīrghāyu’s wife then said to Dīrghāyu the Scholar, ‘I am feeling sad, and I’ve had this thought, “The fourfold army will be arrayed in formation with their armor and shields. They’ll draw their autumn swords and march serenely by. I want to watch it all, and I also want to drink the water from the sharpening of their blades.”’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“Dīrghāyu the Scholar then told his wife, ‘You shouldn’t think that. Why is that? We’ve been ruined by King Brahmadatta. What purpose is there in your seeing his fourfold army arrayed in formation with their armor and shields, drawing their autumn swords, and marching serenely by, or for you to want to drink the water from the sharpening of their blades?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“His wife said, ‘Sir, if I can get this, I’ll have a chance to live. If I don’t get this, I’ll die for sure, without a doubt.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“Dīrghāyu the Scholar then went to the kingdom’s head priest and stood before him. His countenance was downcast, and his voice was poor and slight as he entertained him. After listening, the head priest wasn’t happy.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“The head priest then asked, ‘Scholar, when you stood in front of me before, you were an entertainer with a cheerful expression. After listening to you, I was happier and amused myself. Why do you stand in front of me now with an expression that’s downcast and entertain me with a poor and slight voice? After listening to this, I’m not happier. Dīrghāyu the Scholar, are you not feeling ill or troubled?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“Dīrghāyu the Scholar said, ‘Sir, it’s not that I’m feeling ill. It’s just that I’m troubled. Sir, my wife is sad and has this thought, “The fourfold army will be arrayed in formation with their armor and shields. They’ll draw their autumn swords and march serenely by. I want to watch it all, and I also want to drink the water from the sharpening of their blades.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“‘I then replied to my wife, “You shouldn’t think that. Why is that? We are here now. What purpose is there in your watching the fourfold army arrayed in formation with their armor and shields, drawing their autumn swords, and marching serenely by, or for you to want to drink the water from the sharpening of their blades?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“‘My wife again said to me, “Sir, if I can get this, I’ll have a chance to live. If I don’t get this, I’ll die for sure, without a doubt.” Sir, if my wife doesn’t survive, I won’t have a reason to live, either.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“The head priest asked, ‘Scholar, your wife can watch them, can’t she?’</p>
<p>“He replied, ‘Sir, she can only watch.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“The head priest then led Dīrghāyu the Scholar to his wife. At that point, Dīrghāyu the scholar’s wife was pregnant with a virtuous child. Because he saw that Dīrghāyu’s wife was pregnant with a virtuous child, the head priest knelt on his right knee and faced Dīrghāyu’s wife with his palms together. He proclaimed three times, ‘He’s born of the Kośala king! He’s born of the Kośala king!’ He then instructed everyone to his left and right, ‘Now, don’t let anyone else know!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>“The head priest then told him, ‘Scholar, you mustn’t be sad. I can make it possible for your wife to see the fourfold army arrayed in formation with their armor and shields, draw their autumn swords, and march serenely by, and she’ll be able to drink the water from the sharpening of their blades.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>“The head priest then went to Brahmadatta, the king of Kāsi. When he arrived, he said, ‘Heavenly King, you should know that a virtuous star has appeared. If it pleases the Heavenly King, let the fourfold army be adorned and arrayed in formation with their armor and shields. Let them draw their autumn swords and be directed to march serenely. Let that shining army so dignified sharpen their blades with water. If it pleases the Heavenly King, he could go out and watch them himself. Heavenly King, if this were done, it would surely bring good fortune.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>“King Brahmadatta then ordered his chief military minister, ‘Minister, you should know now that a virtuous star has appeared. It would be fitting for you to order the fourfold army to be adorned and arrayed in formation with their armor and shields. Have them draw their autumn swords and direct them to march serenely. Let that shining army so dignified sharpen their blades with water. I will come out to watch them myself. If this were done, it would surely bring good fortune.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>“The chief military minister then accepted the king’s instructions. The fourfold army was adorned and arrayed in formation with their armor and shields. They drew their autumn swords and were directed to march serenely. That shining army so dignified sharpened their blades with water, and Brahmadatta then went out to watch them himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a>“As a result of this, Dīrghāyu the scholar’s wife was able to see the fourfold army arrayed in formation with their armor and shields, draw their autumn swords, and be directed to march serenely. That shining army was so dignified. She also was able to drink water from the sharpening of their blades. After drinking the blade-sharpening water, her sadness was dispelled. She gave birth to a virtuous son, and they named him Prince Dīrghajāti. They entrusted him to someone to be raised in secret.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>“After he grew up, if he had been among the warrior kings born from the crown, Prince Dīrghajāti would have governed the world under Heaven and obtained a great empire. His various skills included elephant riding, horseback riding, driving, galloping, archery, boxing, net throwing, hook throwing, chariot riding, and sitting in a palanquin. Such various and marvelous skills were all known to him. Whatever subject it was, his wondrous understanding of it was extraordinary. He determined to surpass the world, and his intelligence was outstanding, subtle, and profound. There wasn’t anything he couldn’t comprehend.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a>“Brahmadatta then heard that Dīrghāyu, the king of Kośala, had become a scholar, changed his name, and was living in Bārāṇasī. Brahmadatta ordered everyone to his left and right, ‘Quickly, all of you, go and collect King Dīrghāyu. Bind both his hands and make him run while beating a broken drum that sounds like a donkey braying. After you’ve gone everywhere in the city, take him outside the city’s south gate and make him sit under a tall sign that questions his abdication.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a>“Everyone to his left and right accepted his instructions. They went and collected King Dīrghāyu, bound both his hands, and made him run while beating a broken drum that sounded like a donkey braying. After they’d been everywhere, they took him outside the city’s south gate and made him sit beneath a tall sign that questioned his abdication.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a>“Prince Dīrghajāti hurried to follow after his father. Sometimes while among everyone to his left and right, he said to his father, ‘Fear not, Heavenly King! Fear not, Heavenly King! I am here! Surely, I will save you! Surely, I will save you!’</p>
<p>“King Dīrghāyu told him, ‘Be tolerant, Prince! Be tolerant! Don’t bind yourself with hate! Only act with kindness!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc37'>SC 37</a>“Hearing this, the crowd asked King Dīrghāyu, ‘What sort of principle is that?’</p>
<p>“The king answered the crowd, ‘This prince is intelligent. He’s sure to understand my words.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a>“It was then that Prince Dīrghajāti implored the well-to-do families of Bārāṇasī, ‘Gentlemen, practice generosity and cultivate merit in order to chant this invocation for Dīrghāyu, the king of Kośala: ‘With this gift of merit, may King Dīrghāyu be granted well-being and gain his freedom!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc39'>SC 39</a>“The well-to-do families in Bārāṇasī who were implored by Prince Dīrghajāti then practiced generosity and cultivated merit in order to chant this invocation for Dīrghāyu, the king of Kośala: ‘With this gift of merit, may King Dīrghāyu be granted well-being and gain his freedom!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc40'>SC 40</a>“King Brahmadatta heard: ‘The well-to-do families in Bārāṇasī are practicing generosity and cultivating merit in order to chant this invocation for Dīrghāyu, the king of Kośala: ‘With this gift of merit, may King Dīrghāyu be granted well-being and gain his freedom!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc41'>SC 41</a>“Hearing this, he was so frightened that his hair stood on end. ‘I can’t allow these well-to-do families of Bārāṇasī turn against me! If that’s the case, it would be best to act swiftly and put an end to this before they do.’ King Brahmadatta thereupon ordered everyone to his left and right, ‘Quickly! Go kill Dīrghāyu, the king of Kośala, and chop him into seven pieces.’ Everyone to his left and right accepted his instructions. They went quickly, killed King Dīrghāyu, and chopped him into seven pieces.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc42'>SC 42</a>“Prince Dīrghajāti then implored the well-to-do families in Bārāṇasī, ‘Gentlemen, look at this! Brahmadatta, the king of Kāsi, is violent and unprincipled! He took my father Dīrghāyu, the king of Kośala, who was an innocent man. He captured his kingdom, storehouses, and treasures and killed him with hateful cruelty. He was chopped into seven pieces!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc43'>SC 43</a>“‘Gentlemen, please go and collect my father with a fresh cotton cloth and gather up the seven pieces of his corpse. Make a pile of wood, all incense and fragrant wood, and cremate him. Then go stand in the King’s court and read this statement that I will write. Tell Brahmadatta: “The king of Kośala is Prince Dīrghajāti. He has made this statement: ‘Aren’t you afraid of the future troubles that <span class='add'>[Dīrghāyu’s]</span> descendants will cause you?’”’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc44'>SC 44</a>“The well-to-do families of Bārāṇasī then did as they were asked by Prince Dīrghajāti. They collected the seven pieces of the king’s body with a fresh cotton cloth, made a pile of fragrant wood, and cremated him. They went and stood in the court, reading a statement to Brahmadatta that said, ‘The king of Kośala is Prince Dīrghajāti. He has made this statement: “Aren’t you afraid of the future troubles that <span class='add'>[Dīrghāyu’s]</span> descendants will cause you?”’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc45'>SC 45</a>“King Dīrghāyu’s wife then told Prince Dīrghajāti, ‘You should know that this Brahmadatta, the king of Kāsi, is violent and unprincipled. He took your father Dīrghāyu, the king of Kośala, who was an innocent man. He captured his kingdom, storehouses, and treasures and killed him with hateful cruelty. He was chopped into seven pieces! Prince, come! Together we’ll ride in a single chariot and flee from Bārāṇasī. If you don’t leave, disaster will befall you.’ King Dīrghāyu’s wife and Prince Dīrghajāti then fled from Bārāṇasī riding in a single chariot.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a>“It was then that Prince Dīrghajāti had this thought, ‘I would rather go to the villages and towns, studying and learning broadly.’ After thinking this, Prince Dīrghajāti traveled to villages and towns, studying and learning broadly. Because he became widely learned, he changed his name to Dīrghajāti the Scholar.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc47'>SC 47</a>“Dīrghajāti the Scholar again had this thought, ‘I’ve learned what there was to learn. I would rather go to Bārāṇasī and stand on the streets and in the markets as an entertainer with a cheerful expression. After listening to me, the well-to-do families of Bārāṇasī will be happier and amuse themselves.’ After thinking this, Dīrghajāti the Scholar then went to Bārāṇasī and stood on the streets and in the markets as an entertainer with a cheerful expression. After they thus heard him, the well-to-do families of Bārāṇasī were happier and amused themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc48'>SC 48</a>“Thereupon, King Brahmadatta’s outer retinue heard about him, as did his middle retinue and inner retinue. The kingdom’s head priest heard about him, as did King Brahmadatta in his turn. He asked for a meeting.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc49'>SC 49</a>“Dīrghajāti the Scholar then went to visit King Brahmadatta and stood before him as an entertainer with a cheerful expression. After listening to him, King Brahmadatta was happier and amused himself. King Brahmadatta then told him, ‘Scholar, starting today, you can make use of my home. We will support each other.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc50'>SC 50</a>“Dīrghajāti the Scholar then made use of his home, and King Brahmadatta supported him. Later, he sought the king’s trust and was made a guard. A sword was given to the Dīrghajāti the Scholar.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc51'>SC 51</a>“It was then that King Brahmadatta ordered his driver, ‘Can you prepare a horse carriage? I want to go out for a hunt.’ The driver accepted his instruction, immediately prepared a horse carriage, and returned when he was done. He said, ‘The horse carriage is ready. The heavenly king may do as he likes.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc52'>SC 52</a>“King Brahmadatta and Dīrghajāti the Scholar then rode out in the carriage together. Dīrghajāti the Scholar had this thought, ‘This King Brahmadatta is violent and unprincipled. He took my father Dīrghāyu, the King of Kośala, who was an innocent man. He captured his kingdom, storehouses, and treasures and killed him with hateful cruelty. He was chopped into seven pieces! Now, I’d rather steer the carriage to leave the fourfold army behind in different places.’ After thinking this, Dīrghajāti the Scholar then steered the carriage, leaving the fourfold army behind so that each was in a different place.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc53'>SC 53</a>“At that point, King Brahmadatta brashly walked along a muddy road. Oppressed by wind and heat, he felt pained and thirsty. Exhausted, he wanted to lie down, so he did under the carriage. Using Dīrghajāti the Scholar’s knees as a pillow, he fell asleep.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc54'>SC 54</a>“Dīrghajāti the Scholar then had this thought, ‘This King Brahmadatta is violent and unprincipled. He took my father who was an innocent man. He captured his kingdom, storehouses, and treasures and killed him with hateful cruelty. He was chopped into seven pieces! But on this day, it’s in my hands. It’s up to me to repay him for his hate.’ After thinking this, Dīrghajāti the Scholar drew his sharp sword and placed it on King Brahmadatta’s neck. He said, ‘Now, I’m going to kill you! Now, I’m going kill you!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc55'>SC 55</a>“Dīrghajāti the Scholar again thought, ‘I’m not going to do this. Why is that? I remember that day when my father was under the sign, and the end was near. He said to me, ‘Be tolerant, Prince! Be tolerant! Don’t bind yourself with hate! Only act with kindness!’ After remembering this, he lifted his sword and put it back in its sheath.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc56'>SC 56</a>“King Brahmadatta was then dreaming, and he saw King Dīrghāyu’s son Prince Dīrghajāti holding a drawn sword to his neck, saying, ‘Now, I’m going to kill you! Now, I’m going kill you!’ After seeing this, he was so terrified that his hair stood on end. He woke up suddenly and said to Dīrghajāti the Scholar, ‘Now, you should know that in a dream I saw King Dīrghāyu’s son Prince Dīrghajāti holding a drawn sword to my neck, saying, “Now, I’m going to kill you! Now, I’m going kill you!”’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc57'>SC 57</a>“After hearing this, Dīrghajāti the Scholar said, ‘Fear not, Heavenly King! Fear not! Why is that? I am King Dīrghāyu’s son Prince Dīrghajāti.

He captured his kingdom, storehouses, and treasures and killed him with hateful cruelty. He was chopped into seven pieces! But on this day, it’s in my hands. It’s up to me to repay him for his hate.” Heavenly King, I drew my sword, put it on your neck, and said, “Now, I’m going to kill you! Now, I’m going kill you!” But, Heavenly King, I again thought, “I’m not going to do this. Why is that? I remember that day when my father was under the sign, and the end was near. He said to me, ‘Be tolerant, Prince! Be tolerant! Don’t bind yourself with hate! Only act with kindness!” After remembering that, I lifted my sword and put it back in its sheath.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc58'>SC 58</a>“King Brahmadatta said, ‘Prince, you said, “Be tolerant, Prince! Be tolerant!” I understand the meaning of that. But you also said, “Don’t bind yourself with hate! Act only with kindness!” What does that mean?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc59'>SC 59</a>“Dīrghajāti the prince answered, ‘Heavenly King, “Don’t bind yourself with hate! Act only with kindness!” means precisely this.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc60'>SC 60</a>“After hearing that, King Brahmadatta said, ‘Prince, starting today, my rule of the kingdom will end with our conversation. Your father’s former kingdom will be restored and entrusted to you. Why is that? You’ve done what’s very difficult to do: You spared my life.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc61'>SC 61</a>“After hearing this, Prince Dīrghajāti said, ‘The Heavenly King’s former kingdom is under the control of the King. I can return to my father’s former kingdom.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc62'>SC 62</a>“King Brahmadatta and Prince Dīrghajāti then rode back to Bārāṇasī together. Seated in the main palace, Brahmadatta addressed his ministers, ‘If any of you should see the king of Kośala’s son Prince Dīrghajāti, what would you do?’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc63'>SC 63</a>“When they heard this, some ministers said, ‘Heavenly King, if we saw him, we would lop off his hands.’ Others replied, ‘Heavenly King, if we saw him, we would cut off his feet.’ Still others said, ‘We would end his life.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc64'>SC 64</a>“King Brahmadatta told the ministers, ‘You can look upon the king of Kośala Dīrghāyu’s son Prince Dīrghajāti now, for he is right here. Don’t harbor malice towards this prince. Why is that? This prince has done what’s very difficult to do: He spared my life.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc65'>SC 65</a>“Thereupon, King Brahmadatta used the royal bath to bathe Prince Dīrghajāti, anointed him with royal incense, and dressed him in royal clothes. He directed that he ride on a golden chariot seat and returned him to his former kingdom with his father’s wife.</p>
<h3>The Kauśāmbī Monks</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc66'>SC 66</a>“Monks, those kings were warrior kings born from the crown and the lords of great kingdoms. Ruling the world under heaven, their own actions were tolerant, and they praised tolerance. Their own actions were kind, and they praised kindness.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc67'>SC 67</a>“Monks, you should be likewise. Attaining faith, renouncing home, being homeless, and training on the path, you should act tolerantly and praise tolerance. Your own actions being kind, praise kindness, too. Your own actions being merciful, praise mercy, too.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc68'>SC 68</a>The monks who heard what the Buddha taught had this to say, “The Bhagavān is the Dharma Lord! Now, it would be fitting for him to stay. The other monks instruct us, so how can we not instruct them?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc69'>SC 69</a>The Bhagavān was not pleased with the Kauśāmbī monks’ behavior, reverence, training, and practice. He then rose from his seat and spoke these verses:</p>

<h3>Visiting Venerable Bhagu</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc70'>SC 70</a>After speaking these verses, the Bhagavān then used his supernormal abilities to levitate away. He went to the village of <span class='add'>[Bālakaloṇakāra]</span>, and Venerable Bhagu of the Śākya clan was there.  He didn’t sleep day and night, diligently practicing the path. He was resolved to practice continuous samādhi, abiding in the factors of the path. Seeing the Buddha coming from afar, that venerable of the Śākya clan went to meet him after seeing him. He took the Buddha’s robe and bowl, prepared a seat for the Buddha, and fetched water for washing his feet. After washing his feet, the Buddha sat on the Venerable Śākyan Bhagu’s seat. After sitting, he asked, “Monk Bhagu, have you been doing well? Do you need anything?”</p>
<p>The venerable of the Śākya clan Bhagu said, “Bhagavān, I’m doing well. There isn’t anything that I need.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc71'>SC 71</a>The Bhagavān again asked, “Monk Bhagu, how is it that you are doing well and don’t need anything?”</p>
<p>Venerable Bhagu said, “Bhagavān, I don’t sleep day and night, diligently practicing the path. I’m resolved to practice continuous samādhi, abiding in the factors of the path. Bhagavān, this is how I’m doing well and don’t have anything I need.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc72'>SC 72</a>The Bhagavān thought, “This clansman wanders in contentment. Now, I’d like to teach Dharma for him.” After thinking this, he then taught the Dharma for Venerable Bhagu. He encouraged, roused, and made him rejoice, teaching the Dharma for him with measureless methods.</p>
<h3>The Solitary Elephant</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc73'>SC 73</a>After encouraging, rousing, and making him rejoice, the Bhagavān rose from his seat and went to a protected temple grove. Entering that protected temple grove, he went to a tree, spread out his sitting mat under it, and sat down cross-legged.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc74'>SC 74</a>The Bhagavān thought, “I’ve freed myself from the repeated quarreling of those of Kauśāmbī monks who were subduing each other, disliking each other, and angrily disputing with each other. I’m displeased just thinking about that direction, that residence of the Kauśāmbī monks.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc75'>SC 75</a>At that moment, there was a great elephant who was the king of an elephant herd. He parted with the herd and went wandering alone. He also went to that protected temple grove. Entering the protected temple grove, he came upon the worthy’s sal tree and stood near that rare worthy’s sal tree.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc76'>SC 76</a>It was then that the great elephant thought, “I’ve freed myself from that herd of elephants, those cows, bulls, and young elephants, large and small. Those walking at the front of that herd of elephants trample the grass and muddy the water, and then I eat that trampled grass and drink that muddied water. Now, I can eat and drink fresh grass and clean water!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc77'>SC 77</a>The Bhagavān then knew that thought in this great elephant’s mind using his knowledge of other minds. He spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>{:.verse #v13} “An elephant’s accompanied by other elephants  <br>
Whose body is complete with tusks;  <br>
A heart’s accompanied by other hearts  <br>
If it’s happy dwelling alone in the forest.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc78'>SC 78</a>The Bhagavān then gathered up his robe and bowl from the protected temple grove and went to the <span class='add'>[Pācīnavaṃsa]</span> temple grove.</p>
<h3>Visiting Aniruddha, Nandika, and Kimbila</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc79'>SC 79</a>At the time, the <span class='add'>[Pācīnavaṃsa]</span> temple grove had three clansmen living in it: Venerable Aniruddha, Venerable Nandika, and Venerable Kimbila. Those venerables were practicing in this way: If they solicited food, the one who returned first then prepared seats, and he fetched the water and foot-washing basin. He calmly washed his feet and wiped down his legs with a cloth. He then rinsed out the water jug. If he could eat all the food he solicited, then he ate it all. If some was leftover, he put it in a covered container and set it up high. When the meal was finished, he collected his bowl, washed his hands and feet, and put his sitting mat over his shoulder. He then entered his dwelling to sit quietly.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc80'>SC 80</a>If they solicit alms, the last one to return ate all his food if he could. If it wasn’t enough, he took from the leftover food to have enough to eat. If some was leftover, then he dumped it on clean ground or in water where there were no living things. He then took the others’ food containers and put them to one side after cleaning and wiping them. He rolled up his sitting mat, washed his feet, wiped his legs with a cloth, and put away the foot-washing basin. He also rinsed out the water jug and swept the dining room. After throwing out the refuse and cleaning, he collected his robes and bowl, washed his hands and feet, put his sitting mat over his shoulder, and entered his dwelling to sit quietly.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc81'>SC 81</a>Those venerables would do that until late afternoon. If the first one to emerge from his quiet sitting saw the water jug or the wash basin was empty, then he picked it up. If another was more able, then he would point it out when they came along and set it safely to one side. If another wasn’t more able, then one monk picked them up, or two people lifted them together, and put them to one side. They didn’t say anything to each other nor ask questions while they did that. Those venerables would have a meeting every five days. Sometimes they would discuss the Dharma, and other times they would be nobly silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc82'>SC 82</a>Thereupon, the warden of the grove saw the Bhagavān approaching from afar, and he told him to stop. “Ascetic! Ascetic! Don’t enter this grove! Why is that? In this grove are three clansmen, Venerable Aniruddha, Venerable Nandika, and Venerable Kimbila. If they see you, they may forbid you to be here.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc83'>SC 83</a>The Bhagavān told him, “You, warden of the grove! If they see me, they surely will allow me to be here. None of them will forbid it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc84'>SC 84</a>Venerable Aniruddha then saw the Bhagavān approaching from afar and called, “You, warden of the grove! Don’t warn off the Bhagavān! You, warden of the grove! Don’t stop the Sugata! Why is that? This is our sage who’s approaching! This is our Sugata who’s approaching!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc85'>SC 85</a>Venerable Aniruddha went out and met the Bhagavān, taking the Buddha’s robe and bowl. Venerable Nandika prepared a seat for the Buddha, and Venerable Kimbila fetched water for the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc86'>SC 86</a>After washing his hands and feet and taking the seat that was prepared for him, the Bhagavān asked, “Aniruddha, have you been doing well? Do you need anything?”</p>
<p>Venerable Aniruddha said, “Bhagavān, I am doing well. There isn’t anything that I need.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc87'>SC 87</a>The Bhagavān again asked Aniruddha, “How is it you are doing well and don’t need anything?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc88'>SC 88</a>Venerable Aniruddha said, “Bhagavān, I have thought, ‘I am well blessed with great virtues. That is, I’m practicing together with such practitioners of the religious life.’ Bhagavān, towards these practitioners of the religious life, I always act physically with kindness. Whether seen or unseen, I do so equally and without difference. I act verbally with kindness … I act mentally with kindness. Whether seen or unseen, I do so equally without difference.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc89'>SC 89</a>“Bhagavān, I also think, ‘Now, I’d rather abandon my own thought and follow the thoughts of those noble ones.’ Bhagavān, I then abandon my own thought and follow the thoughts of those noble ones. Bhagavān, there’s never been a single thought I didn’t allow. Bhagavān, this is the way I’m doing well and don’t have anything that I need.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc90'>SC 90</a>When venerable Nandika was asked, his answer was likewise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc91'>SC 91</a>Again, he asked venerable Kimbila, “Have you been doing well? Do you need anything?”</p>
<p>Venerable Kimbila said, “Bhagavān, I am doing well. There isn’t anything that I need.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc92'>SC 92</a>He asked, “Kimbila, how is it you are doing well and don’t need anything?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc93'>SC 93</a>Venerable Kimbila said, “Bhagavān, I have thought, ‘I am well blessed with great virtues.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc95'>SC 95</a>The Bhagavān praised them. “Good, good! In this way, Aniruddha, all of you are always unified together, contented without disputes, single in mind and single in teacher, and joined as one like water and milk. But have you attained the state of the superior man and a distinct and contented dwelling?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc96'>SC 96</a>Venerable Aniruddha said, “In thus way, Bhagavān, we are always united together, contented without disputes, single in mind and single in teacher, and joined as one like water and milk. We’ve attained the state of the superior man and have a distinct and contented dwelling. Bhagavān, we apprehend light and then see forms, but those visions of forms and light soon disappear again.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc97'>SC 97</a>The Bhagavān told him, “Aniruddha, none of you have comprehended these signs, which is to say the signs of apprehending light and seeing forms, and so that vision of forms and light soon disappears again.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc160'>SC 160</a>“Aniruddha, if the disturbance of doubt arose in my mind, my mind was purified of that … the disturbance of unmindfulness … perceiving physical illness … drowsiness … excessive diligence … excessive indolence … fear … elation … conceited thoughts … the arising of diverse notions … the thought of not observing forms … my mind was purified of that. I fully cultivated the samādhi with perception and examination, fully cultivated the samādhi with no perception and some examination, and fully cultivated the samādhi without perception or examination. I fully cultivated one-pointed samādhi, fully cultivated mixed samādhi, fully cultivated a little samādhi, and fully cultivated extensive and measureless samādhi.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc161'>SC 161</a>“I gave rise to knowing and seeing a full and bright purity, headed for a certain abode, and diligently cultivated the factors of the path. Birth was ended, the religious practice was established, and the task was accomplished. I truly knew that I was no longer subject to existence. Aniruddha, at that point I practiced in this way.”</p>
