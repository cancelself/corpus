<h1>225. <span class='add'>[Second Discourse on Abandoning]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “I do not say that, without understanding and without abandoning one thing, one <span class='add'>[attains]</span> the unsurpassed transcendence of <i>dukkha.</i> What is the one thing of which I do not say that, without understanding and without abandoning it, one <span class='add'>[attains]</span> the unsurpassed transcendence of <i>dukkha</i>? That is, I do not say that, without understanding and without abandoning the eye, one <span class='add'>[attains]</span> the unsurpassed transcendence of <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“I do not say of forms, eye-consciousness, eye-contact, and feeling arisen in dependence on eye-contact and experienced within, be it painful, pleasant, or neutral, that, without understanding and without abandoning all these, one <span class='add'>[attains]</span> the unsurpassed transcendence of <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“The ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind <span class='add'>is also like that</span>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
