<h1>28. <span class='add'>Discourse on Nirvāṇa</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. <a class='ref t' id='t6a' href='#t6a'>T 6a</a> At that time a certain monk approached the Buddha, paid homage with his head at the <span class='add'>Buddha’s</span> feet and withdrew to stand at one side. He said to the Buddha: “As the Blessed One has spoken about attaining Nirvāṇa here and now—how does a monk attain Nirvāṇa here and now?”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “It is well, it is well. You now wish to know about Nirvāṇa here and now. Is it like this?” The monk said to the Buddha: “Indeed, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “Listen and pay careful attention to what I will tell you.” The Buddha said to the monk: “Arousing disenchantment for bodily form, being free from desire for it, <span class='add'>proceeding towards</span> its cessation, and by not clinging the mind is rightly liberated from the influxes. This is reckoned how a monk <span class='add'>attains</span> Nirvāṇa here and now. <span class='add'>In the same way</span> arousing disenchantment for feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, being free from desire for it, <span class='add'>proceeding towards</span> its cessation, and by not clinging the mind is rightly liberated from the influxes. This is reckoned how a monk <span class='add'>attains</span> Nirvāṇa here and now.”</p>
<p>Then that monk, hearing what the Buddha had said, was thrilled with delight, paid homage and left.</p>
