<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. At that time a certain monk approached the Buddha … (asking as above, with this difference):</p>
<p>“One who surrenders to the underlying tendencies and surrenders to the underlying tendency at death is reckoned <span class='add'>accordingly</span>. One who does not surrender to the underlying tendencies and does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death is not reckoned <span class='add'>accordingly</span>” …</p>
<p>The Buddha said to the monk: “How do you understand in full the meaning of the teaching I herein spoke in brief?” Then the monk said to the Buddha: “Blessed One, surrendering to the underlying tendencies of bodily form one surrenders to the underlying tendency at death. One who surrenders to the underlying tendencies and surrenders to the underlying tendency at death is reckoned <span class='add'>accordingly</span>. <span class='add'>In the same way</span> surrendering to the underlying tendencies of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness one surrenders to the underlying tendency at death. One who surrenders to the underlying tendencies and surrenders to the underlying tendency at death is reckoned <span class='add'>accordingly</span>.</p>
<p>“Blessed One, if one does not surrender to the underlying tendencies of bodily form, one does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death. One who does not surrender to the underlying tendencies and does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death is not reckoned <span class='add'>accordingly</span>. <span class='add'>In the same way</span> <span class='add'>if</span> one does not surrender to the underlying tendencies of feeling … perception … formations … consciousness one does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death. One who does not surrender to the underlying tendencies and does not surrender to the underlying tendency at death is not reckoned <span class='add'>accordingly</span>. Blessed One, in this way I understand in full the meaning of the teaching herein spoken in brief.”</p>
<p>(<i>In the same way up to</i>) … became an arahant, attaining liberation of the mind.</p>
