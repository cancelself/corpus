<h1>77. <span class='add'>Discourse on Desire and Lust</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should abandon desire and lust for bodily form. Having abandoned desire and lust for it, bodily form will be abandoned. Having abandoned bodily form, you will attain the understanding that it has been abandoned. Having attained the understanding that it has been abandoned, its root will be abandoned, like cutting off the crown of a Palmyra tree, so that it will not grow again in the future.</p>
<p>“In the same way, you should abandon desire and lust for feeling … perception … formations … consciousness … <i>up to</i> … so that it will not grow again in the future.” <a class='ref t' id='t20a' href='#t20a'>T 20a</a></p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
