<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time, the Buddha was dwelling in Śrāvastī, in the Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time, the Bhagavān said to the bhikṣus, “I will now speak of the various realms. Listen carefully and consider well, because I will tell you about them. What are the various realms? Namely, [1] the eye realm, [2] form realm, and [3] eye-consciousness realm; the [4] ear realm, [5] sound realm, and [6] ear-consciousness realm; the [7] nose realm, [8] scent realm, and [9] nose-consciousness realm; the [10] tongue realm, [11] flavor realm, and [12] tongue-consciousness realm; the [13] body realm, [14] contact realm, and [15] body-consciousness realm; the [16] thought realm, [17] dharma realm, and [18] thought-consciousness realm. These are called the various realms.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>After the Buddha had spoken this sūtra, the bhikṣus heard what the Buddha had said, and joyfully practiced in accordance.</p>
