<h1>194. <span class='add'>[Discourse on Giving Rise to Delight]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “If one gives rise to delight in relation to the eye, then one gives rise to delight in relation to what is <i>dukkha</i>. If one gives rise to delight in relation to <i>dukkha</i>, I say, one is not liberated from <i>dukkha</i>. <span class='add'>[If]</span> one gives rise to delight in relation to the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, then one gives rise to delight in relation to <i>dukkha</i>. <span class='add'>[If]</span> one gives rise to delight in relation to what is <i>dukkha</i>, I say, one is not liberated from <i>dukkha</i>.</p>
<p>“Monks, if one does not give rise to delight in relation to the eye, then one does not give rise to delight in relation to what is <i>dukkha</i>. One who does not give rise to delight in relation to <i>dukkha</i>, I say, is liberated from <i>dukkha</i>. <span class='add'>[If]</span> one does not give rise to delight in relation to the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, then one does not give rise to delight in relation to what is <i>dukkha</i>. One who does not give rise to delight in relation to <i>dukkha</i>, I say, is liberated from <i>dukkha</i>.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
