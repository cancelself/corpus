<h1>193. <span class='add'>[Second Discourse on not Being Free from Desire]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “If one is not free from desire for the eye, one’s mind is not liberated and one is not capable of going beyond the <i>dukkha</i> of birth, old age, disease, and death. <span class='add'>[If]</span> one is not free from desire for the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, one’s mind is not liberated and one is not capable of going beyond the <i>dukkha</i> of birth, old age, disease, and death.”</p>
<p>“Monks, if one is free from desire for the eye, one’s mind is liberated and one is capable of going beyond the <i>dukkha</i> of birth, old age, disease, and death. <span class='add'>[If]</span> one is free from desire for the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind, one’s mind is liberated and one is capable of going beyond the <i>dukkha</i> of birth, old age, disease, and death.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
