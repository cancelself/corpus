<h1>161. <span class='add'>[Discourse on the View of Seven Bodies]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “The existence of what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like this and speak like this: 'These are the seven bodies, which are not created, not created by being created, which are not transformed, not transformed by being transformed, they are not killed, they are not moved, they are substantial. What are the seven? That is, they are the earth body, the water body, the fire body, the wind body, pleasure, pain, and the life faculty.</p>
<p>“These seven types of bodies, which are not created, not created by being created, which are not transformed, not transformed by being transformed, they are not killed, they are not moved, they are substantial. They do not alter, do not change, and do not obstruct each other. “If something is meritorious, if it is evil, if it is meritorious and evil, if it is painful, if it is pleasant, if it is painful and pleasant, <span class='add'>[even]</span> if a person cuts off <span class='add'>[another]</span> person's head, yet this is not a form of coercion in the world.</p>
<p>“If there is the life faculty and the <span class='add'>[other six]</span> bodies, and in between these seven bodies one puts a knife, <span class='add'>[moving]</span> it forth and back, still one does not harm the life faculty. In that there is no killing and no killer, no bondage and no one who is bound, no thinking and no thinker, no teaching and no teacher?'”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …” <span class='add'>to be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three discourses.</span></p>
