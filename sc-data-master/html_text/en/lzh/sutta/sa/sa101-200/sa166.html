<h1>166. <span class='add'>[First Discourse on the View that the Self Consists of Form]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “The existence of what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like this and speak like this: 'The self consists of form, anything else is false; the self is formless, anything else is false; the self has form and is formless, anything else is false; the self neither has form nor is formless, anything else is false; the self is limited, anything else is false; the self is unlimited, anything else is false; the self is limited and unlimited, anything else is false; the self is neither limited nor unlimited, anything else is false; <span class='add'>[the self is]</span> with unified perception … with variegated perceptions … with manifold perceptions … with boundless perceptions <span class='add'>[anything else is false]</span>; the self is entirely happy … entirely miserable … either happy or miserable … neither happy nor miserable, anything else is false?'”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …” <span class='add'>to be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three discourses.</span></p>
