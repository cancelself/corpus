<h1>172. <span class='add'>[First Discourse on Eradicating Impermanent Things]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “You should eradicate those things that are impermanent. Having eradicated those things will be for your benefit and welfare, for your peace and happiness for a long time. What things are impermanent? Bodily form is impermanent, feeling … perception … formations … consciousness is impermanent.”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monks were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
