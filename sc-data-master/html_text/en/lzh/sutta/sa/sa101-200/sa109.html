<h1>109. <span class='add'>[Discourse on the Tip of a Hair]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref t' id='t0034a24' href='#t0034a24'>T 0034a24</a><span class='evam'>This have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “It is just as if there were a water pond that is fifty leagues (<i>yojana</i> ) in each direction and of similar depth, and it were full of water. Again, a person with a hair or with a blade of grass or with a fingernail takes a drop of that water. Monks, which do you think is more, that person’s drop of water or the water in the pond?”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The drop of water taken by that person with a hair or with a blade of grass or with a fingernail is little, so little it is not enough to be spoken about. The water in the pond is very much, a hundred, a thousand, a ten-thousand times more, it cannot be compared.”</p>
<p><a class='ref t' id='t0034b04' href='#t0034b04'>T 0034b04</a>“In the same way, monks, like that pond water is the manifold <i>dukkha</i> that has been abandoned by one who has seen the truth, it will never arise again in the future.”</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One, having given this teaching, entered into his hut to sit in meditation. Then the venerable Sāriputta was seated in the assembly. After the Blessed One had gone and entered his hut, <span class='add'>[Sāriputta]</span> said to the monks:</p>
<p><a class='ref t' id='t0034b10' href='#t0034b10'>T 0034b10</a>“I have never before heard the simile of the pond that the Blessed One so well spoke today. Why is that? A noble disciple who is endowed with the vision of the truth gains the fruit of right comprehension (<i>abhisamaya</i> ). If the common folk has wrong view, that has its basis in identity view (<i>sakkāyadiṭṭhi</i> ), accumulates through identity view, arises through identity view, and emerges through identity view. That is, being covered by and experiencing worry and sorrow, they <span class='add'>[still]</span> celebrate and cherish it, call it a self, call it a living being, call it outstanding, special, and hold it to be superior.</p>
<p>“In this way this multitude of wrongness has all been completely given up and eradicated, removed at its root; like a plantain tree it will not arise again in the future.</p>
<p>“Monks, what is the multitude of wrongness <span class='add'>[mentioned]</span> above which the noble disciple, who has seen the truth, has abandoned, and which will never arise again in the future? A foolish unlearned worldling sees bodily form as the self, as being distinct from the self <span class='add'>[in the sense of being owned by it]</span>, the self as being in bodily form, or bodily form as being in the self.He sees feeling … perception … formations … consciousness as the self, as being distinct from the self <span class='add'>[in the sense of being owned by it]</span>, the self as being in consciousness, or consciousness as being in the self.</p>
<p><a class='ref t' id='t0034b15' href='#t0034b15'>T 0034b15</a>“How does he see bodily form as the self? Having attained the earth <i>kasiṇa</i> and contemplated it, he thinks: ‘Earth is the self, the self is earth, the self and earth are just one, not two, they are not different, they are not separate.’</p>
<p>“In the same way having attained the water … fire …. wind … blue … yellow … red … white <i>kasiṇa</i> and contemplated it, he thinks: ‘White[ness] is the self, the self is white[ness], they are just one, not two, they are not different, they are not separate.’ In this way he conceives of a self in relation to each of the <i>kasiṇa</i> s. This is called <span class='add'>[seeing]</span> bodily form as the self.</p>
<p><a class='ref t' id='t0034b21' href='#t0034b21'>T 0034b21</a>“How does he see bodily form as distinct from the self? Suppose he sees feeling as the self.

<p>“How does he see the self as being in bodily form?

<p>“In this way a noble disciple who has seen the four truths gains the fruit of right comprehension and abandons all wrong views, which will never arise again in the future.</p>
<p>“Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, he contemplates it taken together completely in this way:</p>
<p>“‘All of it is impermanent, all of it is <i>dukkha</i>, all of it is empty, all of it is not self, it should not be craved with delight, grasped or kept up. Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class='add'>is also like this</span>, it should not be craved with delight, grasped or kept up.’</p>
<p>“Contemplating in this way he well collects the mind and establishes it, without being deluded by phenomena. He furthermore contemplates with energy, being apart from indolence, and his mind gains joy and happiness, his body and mind are calm, quietly established in equipoise. He is endowed with the constituents of awakening and brings them to fulfilment by cultivation.</p>
<p>“He is forever apart from all evil, it is not the case that he does not extinguish it, it is not the case that he does not bring it to cessation, he eradicates it and does not give rise to it, he decreases it and does not increase it, he abandons it and does not give rise to it. Not clinging and not being attached, he personally realizes Nirvāṇa, <span class='add'>[knowing]</span>: ‘Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.’”</p>
<p>When Sāriputta spoke this teaching, sixty monks by not clinging attained liberation from the influxes in their minds. When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, the monks, hearing what the Buddha had said, were delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
