<h1>162. <span class='add'>[Discourse on the View of Acting]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “The existence of what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like this and speak like this: 'For one who acts, instructs <span class='add'>[someone]</span> to act, destroys, instructs <span class='add'>[someone]</span> to destroy, scorches, instructs <span class='add'>[someone]</span> to scorch, kills, instructs <span class='add'>[someone]</span> to kill, harms living beings, steals the wealth of others, engages in sexual misconduct, knowingly speaks falsehood, drinks liquor, breaks through a wall or destroys a <span class='add'>[door]</span> lock to steal, turns back on a road <span class='add'>[to ambush someone]</span>, harms a village, harms a city, harms people by using a wheel with extremely sharp blades to cut, slash, chop, and slice them up, creating a great heap of flesh, for one who undertakes such practice there is no evil because of this, and also no incurring of evil. Going along the southern <span class='add'>[bank]</span> of the Ganges river killing and harming, or coming along the northern <span class='add'>[bank]</span> of the Ganges river performing a great sacrifice, because of that there is no merit or evil and there is no incurring of merit or evil. Making offerings, disciplining oneself, protecting <span class='add'>[others]</span>, acting for the benefit <span class='add'>[of others]</span> or for mutual benefit, with these actions one does not create merit?'”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …” <span class='add'>to be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three discourses.</span></p>
