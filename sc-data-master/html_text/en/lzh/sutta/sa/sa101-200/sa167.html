<h1>167. <span class='add'>[Second Discourse on the View about the Self Consisting of Form]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
<p>At that time the Blessed One said to the monks: “The existence of what is the cause, by clinging to what, by being fettered and attached to what, by seeing what as the self, do living beings have a view like this and speak like this: 'The self <span class='add'>[consists of]</span> form, anything else is a false notion; the self <span class='add'>[is formless … has form and is formless]</span> … either has form nor is formless, anything else is a false notion; the self is limited, anything else is a false notion; the self is unlimited, anything else is a false notion; the self <span class='add'>[is limited and unlimited]</span> … is neither limited nor unlimited, anything else is a false notion; <span class='add'>[the self is]</span> with unified perception … with variegated perceptions … with narrow perceptions … with boundless perceptions, <span class='add'>[anything else is a false notion]</span>; the self is entirely happy … entirely miserable … either happy or miserable … neither happy nor miserable, <span class='add'>[anything else is a false notion]</span>?'”</p>
<p>The monks said to the Buddha: “The Blessed One is the root of the Dharma, the eye of the Dharma, the foundation of the Dharma …” <span class='add'>to be recited fully in the same way in the sequence of the above three discourses.</span></p>
