<h1>120. <span class='add'>[First Discourse on Māra]</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. At one time the Buddha was staying at Mount Makula, at that time being with an attendant monk by the name of Rādha.</p>
<p>Then the Blessed One said to Rādha: “Whatever bodily form, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it should all be contemplated as being completely made by Māra. Whatever feeling … perception … formations … consciousness, whether past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, sublime or repugnant, far or near, it should all be contemplated as being completely made by Māra.”</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rādha: “Is bodily form permanent or is it impermanent?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is impermanent, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>[The Buddha] asked again: “What is impermanent, is it <i>dukkha</i>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “It is <i>dukkha</i>, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class='add'>is also like this</span>.</p>
<p>[The Buddha] asked again: “Rādha, what is impermanent, <i>dukkha</i>, of a nature to change, would a learned noble disciple herein regard such bodily form as the self, as distinct from the self <span class='add'>[in the sense of being owned by it]</span>, as existing <span class='add'>[within the self, or the self]</span> as existing <span class='add'>[within it]</span>?”</p>
<p>He replied: “No, Blessed One.”</p>
<p>Feeling … perception … formations … consciousness <span class='add'>is also like this</span>.</p>
<p>The Buddha said to Rādha: “Because a learned noble disciple does not view these five aggregates of clinging as a self or as belonging to a self, he does not cling to anything in the whole world. Because of not clinging to anything, he is not attached to anything. Because of not being attached to anything, he personally realizes Nirvāṇa, <span class='add'>[knowing]</span>: 'Birth for me has been eradicated, the holy life has been established, what had to be done has been done, I myself know that there will be no receiving of any further existence.'”</p>
<p>When the Buddha had spoken this discourse, hearing what the Buddha had said the monk Rādha was delighted and received it respectfully.</p>
