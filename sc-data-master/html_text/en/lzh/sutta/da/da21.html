<h2>Talk on Wanderers</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard.</span> The Buddha once, when going on a tour through Magadha country with a great company of monks, with about one thousand and two hundred fifty monks, arrived at Veluvana. And there he put up at the royal rest-house to pass the night.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Now at the same time, there was a wanderer named Suppiya. The youth Brahmadatta was his pupil. Both teacher and pupil always went together, followed step by step after the Buddha and the company of monks. But, while the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Buddha, making assertions in direct contradiction to one another. Why is it so? This is because that they have different views, follow different discipline, and have different association with different people.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Now, a number of monks, after begging for alms, assembled in the hall and this was the trend of their talk: “It is wonderful and marvelous, how the Exalted One, he who has miraculous power and full of respect-inspiring virtue, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, while his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Buddha and the company of monks, making assertions in direct contradiction to one another. This is because they have different views, follow different discipline, and have different association with different people.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Now the Blessed One in the abode of meditation, on hearing what was the drift of their talk through the divine ear which is superior to human ear, rose up from meditation, and went to the preaching hall; and there he took his seat in front of monks. Although, being aware of what those monks were talking, the Buddha deliberately asked: “O, monks. What was the reason that caused all of you to gather here in this hall? What was the subject of your conversation?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Then the bhiksus replied: “After begging our alms, we assembled in this preaching hall. As we sat here, the following conversation sprang up among us: ‘It is wonderful and marvelous, how the Tathagata, who has miraculous power and full of respect-inspiring virtue, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, while his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. So do these two, teacher and pupil, follow step by step after the Buddha and the company of monks, making assertions in direct contradiction to one another. Why is it so? This is because they have different views, different habits, and different association with different people.’ That is why we have gathered here in this preaching hall in order to discuss such a thing.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Then the Buddha told bhiksus: “O, monks. If anyone, in as many ways, should speak in dispraise of me, of the Dharma, or of the Sangha, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart. Why? For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation, you would only be standing in the way of your self-conquest. Therefore, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“And if, monks, others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dharma, or in praise of the Sangha, you should not give way to jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart. Why? For if you were to become jubilant, joyful, and exultant in such a situation, you would only be standing in the way of your self-conquest. Therefore, you should not give way to jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart. Why? It is only to trifling and insignificant matters, to the minor details of mere moral virtue, that the worldling who knows too little to comprehend their deep and subtle meanings would refer when speaking in accordance with what he has directly seen through his eyes in praise of the Tathagata.</p>

And then, the being who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā here in this place. I came into existence without rhyme or reason. There is no one who can create me. I am the Universal Seer, the All-seeing, the Almighty. I am God, the Supreme One, the subtle Maker, the Creator, and the father of all that are and are to be. I am the one who came into existence first. All these beings re-arose here after me. And these beings who re-arose here later all have been created by me.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc67' href='#sc67'>SC 67</a>And the beings who re-arose there after him also think: ‘He is the Great Brahmā. He himself can create; and there is no one who can create him.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc68' href='#sc68'>SC 68</a>Now, this comes to pass, that a certain being, due to exhaustion of his life-span or the exhaustion of merit, passes away from that world and takes rebirth in this world. After growing up, he shaves his head and puts on robes, thus goes forth from household life into homelessness. When he has gone forth, by means of endeavour and diligence, etc., he attains to such a state of mental concentration that with his mind thus concentrated he recollects his immediately preceding life. He speaks thus: ‘The Great Brahmā who can create himself, and there is no one who can create him. He is the Almighty, the All-seeing, the Universal Seer, God, the Supreme Being, the Subtle Maker, the Creator, and the Father of all beings. He is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, and he will remain the same just like eternity itself. But we who have been created by him and have come hither as being impermanent, unstable, doomed to perish, short-lived.’ That’s why we know that the self and the world are partly eternal and partly non-eternal.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc88' href='#sc88'>SC 88</a>There are some recluse or Brahmān who is erudite and well-heard, wise, clever, experienced in controversy, and respected by the world. He is good at distinguishing any viewpoint. He thinks: ‘when I be questioned about the profundity of this or that point, I might not be able to reply. If I could not reply, that would distress me, and that distress would be an obstacle for me. Therefore, out of fear and loathing of being distressed, I have to answer in this way, as my refuge, as my island, as my house, as my path of deliverance. So when someone put a question to me on this or that, I should answer like this: “I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way.

Such a person understands whether there is a world beyond or there is no such a world beyond. But I do neither see nor understand whether there is a world beyond or there is no such a world beyond. If, without understanding, I were to declare there is to be a world beyond or there is to be no world beyond, my declaration might be false, that would distress me. Therefore, out of fear and loathing of making a false statement, I take this as my refuge, as my island, as my house, and as my path of deliverance. So, when someone puts a question to me on this or that, I should answer like this: ‘I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way.

Under these circumstances, desire and lust or hatred and aversion might cause a rebirth. In order to eliminate the pain of remorse, I go forth from the household life into the homelessness. Therefore, out of fear and loathing of the falling into that state, (he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome), he takes this as his refuge, as his island, as his house, and as his path of deliverance.

The body of the Tathagata stands, just for the sake of teaching Dharma to those gods and men. If he stands without the outward form, those gods and men shall have nothing to behold. Just as, when the head of Tala tree has been cut, it can not grow any more—in the same way, having escaped from the cycle of birth and death, the Buddha will not be reborn any more.</p>
