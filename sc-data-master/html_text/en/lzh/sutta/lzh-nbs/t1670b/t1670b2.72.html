<h1>2.72. Ocean</h1>
</header>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “There is the expression ‘ocean’. Is it because of the water or other reasons that it is called the ‘ocean’?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “It is called ocean by men, because there is just as much salt as water, and just as much water as salt.”</p>
<p>“Why is the ocean all of one taste, the taste of salt?”</p>
<p>“The water in the ocean is so salty because it has been so for a very long time, and because fishes, turtles and other insects make it dirty.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
