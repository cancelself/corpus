<h1>2.65. Duration of Taking Rebirth</h1>
</header>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Suppose, two men were to die here simultaneously, one were to be born in the seventh heaven of Brahman, another were to be born in Kashmir, about seven hundred and twenty li from here. Which of the two arrive first?”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena asked, “Both would arrive at their own place simultaneously.”</p>
<p>“How can they arrive simultaneously, since the two distances are so different?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena said: “Then try to think of the country of Alasanda again.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have done so.”</p>
<p>“Then, great king, try to think of Kashmir again.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have done so.”</p>
<p>“Well which one of the two countries did you think of quicker?”</p>
<p>“The two are equal.”</p>
<p>“Just so, if two men were to die simultaneously, and one were to be born in the seventh heaven of Brahman, while the other were to be born in Kashmir, the two men would arrive simultaneously.”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena asked the king, “Suppose, two birds were flying, one were to alight on a tall tree, the other on a small shrub. If they were to settle down simultaneously, whose shadow would first fall on the ground?”</p>
<p>“The two shadows would fall on the ground simultaneously.”</p>
<p>“Just so, if two men were to die simultaneously, and one were to be born in the seventh heaven of Brahman, while the other were to be born in Kashmir, they would also arrive simultaneously.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
