<h1>2.43. Right Practice Leading to Nirvana</h1>
</header>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Can all the learners of the Dharma attain nirvana?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena replied, “Not all the learners of the Dharma can attain nirvana. Those who rightly endeavor to the meritorious Path, learn and know the right things, practice what should be practiced and give up what should not be practiced, think what should be thought, eradicate what should not be thought, will attain nirvana.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
