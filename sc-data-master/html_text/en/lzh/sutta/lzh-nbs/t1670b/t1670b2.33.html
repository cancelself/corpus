<h1>2.33. The Characteristics of Thought</h1>
</header>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena, “What is thought?” Nāgasena replied, “When a thought occurs to a person, that is because he has done something. It is like a person who prepares poison and also drinks it himself, and then makes others drink it. He himself would suffer bodily pain and others also would. It is also like a person who does evil deeds and after the dissolution of the body, he will be reborn in the hells. And those who follow his advice or teaching would also be reborn in the hells. The evil person thus thinks and speaks.</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
