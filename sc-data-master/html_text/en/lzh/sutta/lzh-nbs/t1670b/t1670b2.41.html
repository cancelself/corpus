<h1>2.41. Earth Resting on Water</h1>
</header>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Your people say that the earth rests on water, that water <a class='ref t' id='t715a' href='#t715a'>T 715a</a> rests on air, and that air rests on space. These words, I cannot believe.”</p>
<p>Then the elder Nāgasena took the writing ink(?) of the king and held the pot of writing ink upside down with three fingers and asked the king, “Is the water in this pot supported by atmosphere?”</p>
<p>The king said, “Yes, it is supported by the atmosphere.”</p>
<p>“So is the water supported by air.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
