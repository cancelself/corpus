<h1>2.15. All for the Same Purpose</h1>
</header>
<p>The king asked, “Nāgasena, all the qualities you have mentioned above are so different, are they all for the same purpose of eradicating all defilements?”</p>
<p>Nāgasena said, “Yes, they are. Various kinds of good qualities are described in Buddhist sutras, but they are all for the same purpose of eradicating defilements.”</p>
<p>Nāgasena said, “It is like the king who, although he sends his fourfold army to the battlefield, has one aim of defeating the opposing army. In the same way, the Buddha preached various kinds of good qualities in different sutras, but they serve the same purpose of eradicating different kinds of defilement.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena, you quote the sutras readily.”</p>
