<h1>2.71. On Stopping Breathe</h1>
</header>
<p>The king asked Nāgasena again, “Your sramanas say, ‘I can stop my breathing’. How can they stop their breathing?”</p>
<p>“Then have you ever heard of ‘zhi’—life principle?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I have heard of it.”</p>
<p>“Is the life principle inside the body frame of a person?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I consider that the life principle is inside the body frame of a person.”</p>
<p>Then Nāgasena said, “Great king, the ignorant person cannot control his body and speech, cannot follow the Dharma and precepts. Such a person does not love his own body.”</p>
<p>Nāgasena continued, “People who learn the Dharma can control their body and speech, follow the Dharma and precepts, and can obtain one-pointedness of the mind. Thus they attain the fourth dhyana state. So can they stop their breathing.”</p>
<p>“Excellent, Nāgasena.”</p>
