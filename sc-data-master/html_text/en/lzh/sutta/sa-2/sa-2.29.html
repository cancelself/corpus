<h1>Māra disturbs the Buddha’s rest</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Park. During the first watch of the night, the Buddha <span class='add'>practiced while</span> sitting in meditation and <span class='add'>while</span> walking. When the first watch ended, he washed his feet and entered his abode, lay down on his right side, one leg resting on the other and, focusing his mind on clarity, directed his thoughts towards rising <span class='add'>again after the rest</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>King Māra the Bad, understanding the Buddha’s mind, had this thought: “The renunciant Gotama is in Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Park. During the first watch of the night, he <span class='add'>practiced while</span> sitting in meditation and walking. When the middle watch of the night began, he washed his feet, entered his abode, and lay down on his right side, one leg resting on the other and, focusing his mind on clarity, he directed his thoughts towards rising <span class='add'>again after the rest</span>. I should now go and disturb him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Thereupon, King Māra transformed himself into a young man, <span class='add'>stood</span> in front of the <i>Tathāgata</i> and spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Do you have nothing else to do /<br>
that you take a nap,<br>
peacefully slumbering, not waking up? /<br>
Passed out as if drunk,<br>
a person without wealth and property /<br>
how can he sleep untroubled?<br>
<span class='add'>Only</span> those with great wealth and property /<br>
pleased and happy fall asleep.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Then the World-honored One knew that Māra had come to disturb him and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“I sleep, not because I lack things to do /<br>
neither am I drunk.<br>
It is because I have no worldly wealth /<br>
that I can sleep now.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>It is because I have gained great<i>Dhamma</i> wealth /<br>
that I can sleep peacefully.<br>
In my sleep /<br>
in every breathing in and breathing out<br>
there is benefit /<br>
nothing is lost.<br>
Awake, there are no doubtful thoughts; /<br>
there is nothing to fear in slumber.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>There are those that have troubles as if a poisoned arrow /<br>
has pierced their heart,<br>
afflicted with many sufferings and pains. /<br>
If even those can sleep,<br>
Why should I who have pulled out the poisoned arrow /<br>
not find sleep?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>On hearing this, Māra thought: “The renunciant Gotama knows my mind,” and sad and dejected he returned to his palace.</p>
