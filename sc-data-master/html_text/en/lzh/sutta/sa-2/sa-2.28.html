<h1>Māra transforms himself into a snake to frighten the Buddha</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time, in the middle of the night, the World-honored One was practicing walking meditation in the open. Having washed his feet, he entered his silent abode, sat upright and focused his attention in front of him. Then, King Māra the Bad had this thought: “The renunciant Gotama <span class='add'>staying</span> in Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain is practicing walking meditation in the open. I should go and disturb him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>At that time King Māra changed into a huge snake that was long and thick like a large boat. With a pair of eyes glittering brightly like a <span class='add'>bronze</span> bowl from the land of Kosala, tongue flicking in and out like lightning and breath heaving like thunder, it stood before the Buddha and coiled its body around him. Then, it bent its neck forward, and lowered its head on to the head of the Buddha. The Buddha, who knew that this was Māra <span class='add'>trying</span> to disturb him, spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“I live in complete solitude /<br>
the mind focused in true liberation,<br>
in quiet meditation and physical cultivation /<br>
according to the teaching of the former Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Poisonous snakes, fierce and violent /<br>
of terrifying appearance,<br>
constrictor snakes and vermin: /<br>
all these disturbances /<br>
cannot stir even one hair <span class='add'>on my body</span> /<br>
much less frighten me.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>If the sky broke apart /<br>
or the great earth shook,<br>
all beings /<br>
would feel great terror;<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> to frighten me /<br>
is not possible.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Even if you aimed a poisoned arrow /<br>
at my heart,<br>
the moment the arrow struck /<br>
I would not seek protection;<br>
nevertheless the poisoned arrow /<br>
cannot penetrate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>When King Māra heard the Buddha speak this verse he thought: “The Gotama renunciant knows my mind!” and he became deeply afraid. Depressed and dispirited, he made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
