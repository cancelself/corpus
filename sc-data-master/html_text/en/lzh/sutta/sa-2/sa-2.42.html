<h1>Sakka pays obeisance to the Buddha 3 (Saṅgha)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time the Buddha told the monks: “A long time ago Sakka Devānaṁ Inda wanted to go for a ride and enjoy his parkland. He ordered his charioteer Mātali: “Harness the thousand-horse chariot!” Soon Mātali had harnessed the chariot, went to Sakka, and said to him: “The chariot is ready. We may leave whenever you please.” Thereupon Sakka left the Vejayanta Palace and with palms together paid obeisance facing west. When Mātali saw this, surprise and fear arose in him, and he dropped whip and reins.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Sakka said: “What have you seen that you are so scared?” Mātali said: “Maghavā! Husband of Sujā! When I saw you with folded hands paying obeisance facing west, my mind became filled with fear and I dropped whip and reins. All beings revere you; all the kings are under your rule. The four <span class='add'>heavenly</span> kings and the thirty-three gods all respectfully revere you. Who then surpasses you in power, that you stand and pay obeisance with folded hands facing west?” Sakka answered: “I am revered by everyone: this might be as you say. <span class='add'>However,</span> what all gods and human beings respectfully venerate is the <i>Saṅgha</i>. I respectfully pay obeisance to the <i>Saṅgha</i>.”</p>
<p>Thereupon Mātali spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“The human body is filled with pus and sweat, /<br>
worse than an exposed corpse,<br>
always afflicted by hunger and thirst. /<br>
Why do you admire these homeless ones?<br>
Why do you now /<br>
venerate them thus?<br>
What beauty do they have /<br>
and what virtue?<br>
Please tell me, /<br>
I will now listen attentively.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Sakka Devānaṁ Inda spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Just because they are homeless, /<br>
I admire them.<br>
They own no goods, /<br>
no storehouses and no grain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>They have left all tasks and business /<br>
to frugally live out their lives in harmony.<br>
They keep the precepts well, /<br>
discuss the wonderful Dhamma.<br>
Brave and firm are they, without fear, /<br>
practicing noble silence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Gods and asuras /<br>
fight incessantly,<br>
and as to men, /<br>
each harbors anger and ambition.<br>
I venerate those /<br>
who have abandoned knife and cudgel.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>Everyone else strives to accumulate <span class='add'>riches</span>; /<br>
<i>they</i> let go of everything.<br>
What the world holds dear, /<br>
their minds have discarded.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>I pay obeisance to those /<br>
who have abandoned all extremes.<br>
This, Mātali, /<br>
you should know.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mātali spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“You venerate the very best /<br>
I will follow you in paying homage to them.<br>
What the Maghavā venerates /<br>
I too shall venerate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>Having spoken this verse, Sakka mounted the chariot and departed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka is powerful among men and gods. If even he venerates the <i>Saṅgha</i>, how much more should you, monks, who have left home to train in the path, venerate the <i>Saṅgha.</i>”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>When the Buddha had finished, the monks, having listened to what he had said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
