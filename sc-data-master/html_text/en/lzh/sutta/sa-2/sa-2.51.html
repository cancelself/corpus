<h1>A pauper is reborn in Tāvatiṁsa</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying in Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove of Kalandaka.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time in Rājagaha there was a pauper. Extremely poor and pitiable, he <span class='add'>nevertheless</span> had pure faith in the teachings of the Buddha, could keep the precepts purely, recite the sutras a little, and even make some small offerings. Upon the breaking up of his body, after his death, he was reborn in Tāvatiṁsa, the most wonderful of all places, as the karmic result of these four things. As anewborn <i>deva</i> he was endowed with three superior things. First, he was of superior beauty. Second, he was of superior glory. Third, he was endowed with superior life-span. When the <span class='add'>other</span> <i>deva</i>s saw this, they all admired him. They went to Sakka and said to him: “There is a newborn <i>deva</i>, who is superior to us other <i>deva</i>s in three ways.” Sakka said: “I saw this newborn <i>deva</i> <span class='add'>in his former existence</span>. Formally, as a human being, he was poor and deprived, extremely wretched. <span class='add'>However,</span> he straightforwardly held faith in the three jewels, kept the precepts purely, and even made some small donations. Now he is born into this Tāvatiṁsa heaven.”</p>
<p>Then Sakka spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“If a person has pure faith in the three jewels, /<br>
<span class='add'>if his</span> mind is stable and unwavering,<br>
<span class='add'>if he</span> keeps the precepts he has undertaken, not breaking them: /<br>
know that this person should not be called poor.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>He <span class='add'>should be</span> called wise and long-lived. /<br>
Through venerating the unsurpassable three jewels,<br>
He will be reborn in heaven and attain great bliss. /<br>
Therefore one should train in this way.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When the <i>deva</i>s heard this verse, they were happy, received it in faith, paid their respects and returned to their palaces.</p>
