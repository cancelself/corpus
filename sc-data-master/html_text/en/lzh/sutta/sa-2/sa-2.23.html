<h1>Māra disturbs a teaching on impermanence</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying <span class='add'>north of</span> Rājagaha in the Sītavana forest. At that time the Buddha told the monks: “Human life is short, it is bound to end. You should make an effort to follow the path and practice in purity and celibacy. Therefore do not be lazy; practice right conduct. You should train yourselves in the <span class='add'>right</span> meaning of the <i>Dhamma</i> and true conduct.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time the Demon King Māra, having heard what was said, thought: “The renunciant Gotama is expounding the principles of the <i>Dhamma</i> for his disciples in the Sītavana forest at Rājagaha. I should go there and disturb them.” Having thought thus, he transformed himself into a young man and went to the Buddha. He paid homage at his feet and stood to one side. Then he spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Human life is long /<br>
without any cares or worries.<br>
<span class='add'>For those</span> always at ease /<br>
there is no path for death.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Buddha thought: “Māra the Bad has come to confuse and disturb us.” And he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Human life hurries quickly away /<br>
filled with confusion and trouble;<br>
make haste to practice the good /<br>
as if your head were on fire,<br>
and know the Bad One /<br>
has come to disturb.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Then King Māra, having heard the verse, thought: “The renunciant Gotama knows my intentions.” And he became depressed and dispirited and felt deep regret. He made himself invisible and returned to his heavenly palace.</p>
