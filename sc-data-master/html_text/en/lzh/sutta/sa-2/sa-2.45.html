<h1>Sakka visits by night</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time Sakka Devānaṁ Inda, of beautiful appearance, surpassing human beings and <i>deva</i>s, came to where the Buddha was in the middle of the night. He paid homage at the Buddha’s feet and sat to one side. At that time the entire Jeta Grove was filled with light brighter than daylight. Sakka Devānaṁ Inda spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Destroying what can one find peace and rest? /<br>
Getting rid of what can one be free of sorrow?<br>
The cessation of what is praised by Gotama? /<br>
Please dispel my doubts!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>At that time the World-honored One replied with a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Destroying anger, one finds peace and rest. /<br>
Getting rid of anger, one is without sorrow.<br>
Pulling out anger’s stinging, poisonous root: /<br>
this, Sakka, you should know.<br>
Since anger destroys the good, /<br>
those who get rid of it will be praised.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Having heard what the Buddha said, Sakka Devānaṁ Inda circumambulated him three times, was happy and remembered it well.</p>
