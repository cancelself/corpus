<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in the Anāthapiṇḍika Park.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time the nun Somā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she cleaned her bowl, gathered her seat <span class='add'>for meditation</span> and went to the Andhavana forest <span class='add'>to meditate</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>King Māra the Bad thought: “The nun Somā took her robes and her begging bowl and entered Sāvatthī to beg for food. Having finished her meal, she has cleaned her bowl, and gathered her seat <span class='add'>for meditation</span> and is now on her way to the Andhavana forest <span class='add'>to meditate</span>.” Thereupon the Bad One transformed himself into a <i>brāhmaṇa</i>, stood by the wayside, and said: “My lady, where are you going?” The nun answered: “I am going to a secluded place.” Then the Bad One spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“The stage which seers attain, /<br>
that state is difficult to reach.<br>
With your inferior intelligence /<br>
you cannot attain that state.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Thereupon the nun thought: “Is this a human or a non-human being, who wants to disturb me?” She entered <span class='add'>a state of meditative</span> concentration and, using her insight, she recognized that it was the Bad One. She spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“The mark of womanhood has nothing to do with it /<br>
if only the mind practices meditative concentration<br>
And perceives the highest <i>Dhamma</i>; /<br>
as long as there are the marks of man—and womanhood,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>One can say that women /<br>
are not apt for the <i>Dhamma.</i><br>
Once the marks of man—and womanhood are no more /<br>
from where should distinctions arise?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><span class='add'>I have</span> cut off all craving, /<br>
the darkness of ignorance is destroyed.<br>
Having reached complete cessation, /<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> dwell in a state of purity.<br>
Therefore understand: /<br>
Bad One you are defeated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>At that time the Bad One thought: “The nun Somā knows my mind well!” Depressed, dispirited, and ashamed he returned to his palace.</p>
