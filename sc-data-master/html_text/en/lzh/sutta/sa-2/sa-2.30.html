<h1>Māra plays the Vīṇā—Godhika</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Vebhāra Mountain, in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time, there was a monk called Godhika who lived alone in a cave on Isigili mountain, at the Black Rock. Living in the wilderness, he made diligent efforts, and through his tenacity cut through the view of self and attained temporary liberation, having experienced <span class='add'>all</span> stages of <i>jhāna</i> meditation. Then he regressed and lost <span class='add'>the experience of liberation</span>. <span class='add'>This happened</span> a second time, a third time … altogether six times. Always he regressed. Then the monk thought: “Now, living alone and making diligent efforts, I have regressed six times. If I regress again, I will kill myself with a knife.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>King Māra the Bad knew that the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha on Gijjhakūṭa Mountain in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave. He also knew that a disciple of the Buddha called Godhika was staying near Rājagaha, on Isigili Mountain, at the Black Rock. There, making diligent efforts with tenacious mind, Godhika had attained temporary liberation, had personally witnessed <span class='add'>the truth</span>, but after each of the six attainments had regressed. At that time King Māra had this thought: “When the monk Godhika attains <span class='add'>temporary liberation</span> for the seventh time, he will certainly kill himself, and leave the world of Māra.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Having thought thus, he took his harp of beryl and went before the Buddha. Plucking his harp he composed this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“You endowed with great wisdom and great strength /<br>
with great magical powers,<br>
having attained freedom in the Dhamma /<br>
your majestic radiance shines brightly.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Now your <i>sāvaka</i> disciple /<br>
wishes to kill himself.<br>
You, best among men /<br>
should restrain him.<br>
How could he who rejoices in your teaching /<br>
die while still learning it?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>When King Māra had spoken this verse, the Buddha said to him: “Bad One, you have always been a great friend of the slothful. What you said just now was spoken for your own sake, not for the sake of that monk.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>At that time the World-honored One spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“If one is not easily frightened /<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> persistently practices diligently,<br>
one can always enjoy meditation /<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> day and night practice the good.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><span class='add'>Godhika</span> has ended the propensity for lust and desire /<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> defeated your armies.<br>
<span class='add'>He</span> has now cast off his final body /<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> entered <i>Nirvāṇa</i> forever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>There King Māra became sad and dispirited, dropped his harp of beryl and sadly and regretfully returned to his palace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>The Buddha ordered the monks to <span class='add'>follow him to</span> Godhika’s place at Isigili. <span class='add'>There</span> they saw something like smoke gathering to the east of Godhika’s corpse. The Buddha said to the monks: “Do you see the smoke gathering?” The monks said: “Yes, World-honored One, we see it.” <span class='add'>Then the smoke</span> gathered likewise towards the south, the west and the north <span class='add'>of Godhika’s body</span>. The Buddha said to the monks: “This is the Bad One; his form is hidden and he is surrounding Godhika looking for his consciousness.” The Buddha said to the monks: “The monk Godhika has entered <i>Nirvāṇa</i>; there is no consciousness <span class='add'>to be found</span>; there is no destination.” At that time, King Māra changed into a young man and spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Above and below and in the four directions /<br>
I have searched for Godhika’s consciousness.<br>
Does no one know his destination /<br>
where his consciousness abides?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>At that time the Buddha said to the Bad One: “Thus the wise and steadfast one has vanquished your armies and entered <i>Nirvāṇa</i>.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having heard what he said, were happy and remembered it well.</p>
