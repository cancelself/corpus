<h1>Sakka debates with Vepacitti</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>, once, the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time the World-honored One told the monks: “A long time ago Sakka Devānaṁ Inda, leader of the gods, was about to do battle with the <i>asura</i>s. At that time Sakka Devānaṁ Inda said to Vepacitti, king of the <i>asura</i>s: “We should not lead our armies to harm each other, but instead should debate, and thus decide who wins and who loses.” Vepacitti said to Sakka Devānaṁ Inda: “Kosiya, if we were to debate, who would determine the winner and the loser?” Sakka Devānaṁ Inda said: “In both our armies there are people who are intelligent, of wise judgment, able to tell good from bad, and to decide who will be the winner and who the loser.” Vepacitti said: “You speak first, Sakka!” <span class='add'>But</span> Sakka answered: “My turn will come. You are the older <i>deva</i>. You speak first.” And Vepacitti spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“If I were to tolerate transgressions /<br>
the foolish would say of my patient manner:<br>
‘His patience is born of fear’ /<br>
and deem themselves superior.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply Sakka Devānaṁ Inda spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Though the other might call it fear /<br>
and <span class='add'>think</span> he has gained the upper hand,<br>
precious treasures and all benefits /<br>
<span class='add'>are for those</span> invincible ones who are patient when insulted.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Vepacitti spoke another verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“The foolish have no wisdom /<br>
they have to be restrained.<br>
<span class='add'>They are</span> like a cow at the rear /<br>
attempting to stampede over those ones in front of it on the path.<br>
The knife and cudgel are necessary /<br>
to reign in fools.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sakka Devānaṁ Inda answered with this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“I believe that for restraining the foolish /<br>
silent patience is the best.<br>
<span class='add'>When</span> extreme hatred or anger or rage /<br>
is suffered patiently, the other <span class='add'>party</span> will naturally calm down.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Those without anger, without violence, /<br>
those are noble ones,<br>
They are disciples of noble ones; /<br>
those one should always befriend.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>For those filled with hatred and anger, /<br>
their hatred is an obstacle heavy as a mountain.<br>
But if, at a time of hatred and anger, /<br>
one can restrain oneself even a little,<br>
then that is called good karma /<br>
like reining in an unruly horse.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The wise among the gods and the <i>asura</i>s debated this thoroughly, weighing up who had won and who had lost. <span class='add'>They agreed</span> that the <span class='add'>king of the</span> <i>asura</i>s had spoken in favor of strife and battle, while Sakka Devānaṁ Inda <span class='add'>had spoken for</span> ending quarrels, his mind not favoring angry contest. Thus, the <i>asura</i> <span class='add'>king</span> lost and Sakka won.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>The Buddha told the monks: “Sakka Devānaṁ Inda, who rules freely in <span class='add'>the Tāvatiṁsa</span> heaven, has during the long night <span class='add'>of <i>saṁsāra</i></span> patiently suffered insults, now extols the way of patience. You too, monks, should bear insults patiently, and extol those who are patient. This is called living the homeless life.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>When the Buddha had finished speaking, the monks, having heard what he had said, were happy and bore it well in mind remembered it well.</p>
