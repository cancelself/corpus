<h1>Dharmaguptaka Monks’ Code of Discipline</h1>
</header>
<h2>Introductory verses</h2>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a> I bend my head in adoration, and worship all the Buddhas,<br>
The Holy Law, and the Church.<br>
Now I proclaim the Law of the Vinaya,<br>
In order to establish for aye the True Law.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a> These Precepts are like the fathomless ocean.<br>
Like gems are they, which one tires not in seeking.<br>
Desiring to preserve the treasure of the Holy Law,<br>
In the hearing of the assembly I repeat it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a> Wishful to prevent the prevalence of false views,<br>
I now proclaim these Precepts before the Assembly,<br>
Delivered to us from the earliest times.<br>
Let the Monks then attend!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a> Just as if a man destroyed his feet,<br>
So that he could no longer walk,<br>
So it is to destroy these Precepts,<br>
Without which there can be no birth in Heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a> Let all those who desire such birth,<br>
Who now are living in the world,<br>
Guard and preserve these Precepts, as feet,<br>
Beware of injuring or mutilating them,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a> For as a chariot which has entered<br>
on a narrow and dangerous road,<br>
And suddenly breaks its axle, or loses a linch-pin,<br>
So is the case of the man who breaks the Precepts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a> At the time of death what forebodings!<br>
For as a man looking in a mirror,<br>
Sees himself graceful or deformed, and so has pleasure or pain,<br>
Such is the effect of the Law being declared.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a> Has it been observed? What joy!<br>
Has it been neglected? What dismay!<br>
So also as when two hostile armies contend,<br>
The brave advance, the cowards retreat,</p>
Thus is it with respect to this Law,<br>
The pure advance boldly, the transgressors go back.
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a> As a king is supreme amongst men,<br>
As the ocean is chief of all flowing waters,<br>
As the moon is chief among the stars,<br>
As Buddha is pre-eminent among Sages,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a> So among all the codes of Rules,<br>
(This) Book of Precepts is the best.<br>
Tathāgata has established that these Laws,<br>
Should be declared publicly every half month.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Preliminary</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a> Are the Monks assembled? (They are.) Are all things arranged? (seats, water, sweeping, etc.) (They are.) Let all depart who are not ordained. (If any, let them go; if none are present, let them say so.) Does any monk here present ask for absolution? (Let them answer accordingly.) Exhortation must be given to the nuns, (but if there are none present let them say so.) Are we agreed what our present business is? It is to repeat the Precepts in this lawful assembly.</p>
<h2>nidāna</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a> Venerable brethren (Bhante) attend now! On this 15th or 14th day of the white division of the month (or the dark division, as the case may be), let the assembled monks listen attentively and patiently, whilst the Precepts are distinctly recited.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a> Brethren! I desire to go through the Pātimokkha. Monks assembled thus, let all consider and devoutly reflect on these Precepts. If any have transgressed let them repent. If none have transgressed then stand silent. By their silence, brethren, it shall be known that you are guiltless.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a> Now if a stranger ask one of us a question, we are bound to reply truthfully; so, also, monks, we who reside in community, if we know that we have done wrong and yet decline to acknowledge it, we are guilty of prevarication. But Buddha has declared that prevarication effectually prevents our religious advancement. That brother, therefore, who is conscious of transgression, and desires absolution, ought at once to declare his fault, and after proper penance he shall have rest and peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a> Brethren! having repeated this preface, I ask of you all: Is this assembly pure or not? (Repeat this three times.) Brethren, this assembly is pure, therefore it is silent. Silent you stand. So let it be!</p>
<h2>4 pārājika rules</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a> Brethren, I now proceed to recite the four parajika laws, ordered to be recited twice every month.</p>
<h4>Pārājika 1</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a> If a monk holding the precepts and agreeing there with, without leaving the community, act in opposition to the precepts, and repent not, wickedly practising all sorts of impure conduct, till he come to live in common with the brute beasts, this monk shall be excluded and cut off from the assembly.</p>
<h4>Pārājika 2</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a> If a monk living in a village, or an uninhabited place (quiet place), encouraging a thievish disposition, take goods which are not given him, with a thievish intent; and if a king or his minister take this man and imprison, banish, or kill him (saying), “You are a thief, or you are a fool, or you are besotted!” This monk shall be excluded, and separated from the community.</p>
<h4>Pārājika 3</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a> If a monk cause a man’s death, or hold a weapon and give it a man (for the purpose), or if he speak of the advantages of death, or if he ceaselessly exhort one to meet death (saying), “Tush! you are a brave man,” or use such wicked speech as this, “It is far better to die and not to live,” using such considerations as these, bringing every sort of expedient into use, praising death, exhorting to death. This monk ought to be excluded and cut off.</p>
<h4>Pārājika 4</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a> If a monk, having no true knowledge, speak of himself in these words, “I have attained perfection (lit. the law above men), I have entered on the most excellent law of holy or sacred wisdom, I know Truth; I see Truth; and if that man at another time, whether asked or unasked, desiring absolution, shall speak thus: “Indeed I neither know nor see, and when I said I saw, and when I said I knew, it was but vain, wild and false language, in order to exclude the necessity of further advance, and to encourage my idle disposition.” This monk ought to be excluded and cut off.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a> Worthy Sirs! I have thus delivered the four Pārājika rules. If there be any monk who has transgressed either one or other of them, it is impossible for such a man to live in the community after his sin as he was before. That man has acquired the guilt which demands exclusion, and ought not to live as a member of the monkhood. I demand, therefore, Brethren! Are ye all in this assembly pure [3 times]. Brethren! This assembly is pure! Silently, therefore, ye stand! So let it be!</p>
<h2>13 saṅghādisesa rules</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a> Brethren! I now proceed to recite the 13 Saṅghādisesa Rules.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 1</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a> If a monk by pampering lustful thoughts be conquered by them, except in his dreams, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 2</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a> If a monk, encouraging lustful desires, bring his body into contact with that of a woman, whatever part of her body it be, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 3</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a> If a monk, encouraging lustful thoughts, talk lewdly with a woman, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 4</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a> If a monk, encouraging lustful thoughts, pampering his body, say, in the presence of a woman, “Honourable sister, I am preparing myself by the purest Rule, holding the precepts in their fullest perfection, preparing my self in the law of perfect virtue, which admits of holding these laws of lustful desires, (come) minister to me!” and being thus ministered to by the woman, let him be suspended and undergo the highest penance.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 5</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a> If a monk, in his journeyings, busy himself as a matchmaker between this one and another, and being the messenger of a man, talk with the woman on these points, or being the messenger of a woman, talk with the man on this subject; and if he thus complete arrangements so that there be intercourse between the two, whether for marriage or the occasion only, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 6</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a> If a monk seek to get a house for himself, without a householder, on his own account alone, he must take care to observe the proper measurements; the mean measure ments are these, twelve of Buddha’s spans in length, and within, seven of these spans broad. He ought also to take the body of the monks, to mark out the position of the place given, in doing which they must observe the character of the place, that it be not either dangerous of approach or difficult of access; if the monk, notwithstanding the illegal position, still build his house, or if he take not the monks to inspect it, or if it exceed the lawful measurement, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 7</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a> If a monk desire to construct a large house with a proprietor, but for himself, he ought to take certain of the monks to inspect the character of the site, to see that it is a place without any difficulty of approach, and not in a dangerous neighbourhood; if he does not observe these regulations, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 8</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a> If a monk, from the blind effects of angry resentment, vilify a monk (as worthy of being) Pārājika, whereas his assertion is mere slander, wishing to remove that man from his purity, and at another time, solicited or not, he confess that his charge resulted from anger, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 9</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc31' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a> If a monk, because he is angry, take an idea from a different subject, and slander a monk as fit to be Pārājika, without cause, and if at another time, solicited or not, he confess that he did so through anger, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 10</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc32' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a> If a monk, wishing to break the harmony among the community, plot and consider how to accomplish this, firmly holding to his intention and not relinquishing it, another monk (acquainted with his purpose), ought to expostulate with him and say, “Brother! do not inter rupt the harmony of the assembly! do not devise ex pedients for this purpose! do not consider the best means of doing this mischief! holding to it and persevering in it. Brother! There ought to be harmony in the community, peace and not wrangling, as the learner of one master; agreeing, as milk combines with water; so combining in the law of Buddha! There is profit and rest in so doing I” If the (wicked) monk, at the time of being thus exhorted, still keep to his purpose, and relinquish it not, the other must expostulate three times, in order to induce the first to lay aside his purpose; if, after the third warning, he give up his intention, it is well! but if not, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 11</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a> If a monk have formod a cabal, say of one, two, or three, or more (brothers), and if he shall thus address the other (who has been expostulating with some offender), Brother, do not chide this monk, he is a good man, and speaks according to the law and precepts. What he says I and others approve of and rejoice at.” Then the first shall reply, expostulating, thus, “Brother! say not so! say not that this monk is in agreement with the law and precepts; say not you approve and rejoice at what he says, for in truth this monk is an opposer of the Law in saying what he does; he is a transgressor of the precepts! Brother! do not desire thus to break the harmony of the community! you ought, indeed, to rejoice at, and desire to see harmony amongst the brethren. Brother! amongst monks there should be peace and not wrangling! learners of one master, as milk mingles with water, so should it be in the law of Buddha, having peace there is great prosperity!” If, at the time of this warning, the other still hold his resolve, let the expostulation be repeated three times, etc.; if he hear, well! if not, let him be suspended!</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 12</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a> If a monk, depending on (or attached to) a certain village (or, it may be, an assembly of monks"), live (in a fixed habitation) in a city or town, and pollute the house in which he lives, walking disorderly, so that all see it and hear it, all the monks ought to converse with this monk, and say, “Brother! you have polluted the family in which you reside; your conduct is disorderly; all men see it, and talk of it. Now, you are able to leave this monastery (assembly) and go elsewhere; you may not live in this community/ These monks so speaking, and that one replying, “Brothers! this community is one-sided (through love), is full of anger, wishes to terrify, is foolish; there are other monks guilty of this same fault, some are ex pelled, and some not.” Then all the monks, chiding him, shall say, “Brother! say not so, that in this community there are monks of such character, whereas it is not the case. Brother, it is your disorderly conduct which all men see and talk about (that is the cause of our speaking as we do).” Thus if he, at the time of this warning, still hold his opinion, let it be repeated three times; if he retract and repent, well! if not, let him be suspended.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādisesa 13</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc35' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a> If a monk, of a bad disposition, will not bear being spoken to, according to the direction of the law of precepts, and if, when all the monks have expostulated with him on this account, he reply, “Brother, do not talk thus at me! whether I am right or wrong! I also will say nothing to you, whether right or wrong. Brother, be agreed (or satisfied), do not find fault!” Those monks, addressing him, shall say, “Brother! refuse not to receive our appeal! a brother ought to receive the word of (kind) expostulation. Brother! as the law corrects all the monks, so would all the monks, according to the law, expostulate with our brother. So the disciples of Buddha shall all receive profit, correcting each other in turn for their faults, and mutually inviting each other to further repentance.” These monks thus speaking to him, if he still hold by his opinion after three warnings, let him be suspended.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc36' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a> Monks! thus have I repeated the thirteen Saṅghādisesa ordinances: the first nine (to be inflicted) for the first offence, the others after three warnings. If a monk have broken any one of the laws (above named), and wil fully concealed it, he ought to be placed under compulsory solitary confinement (<i>pravāsa</i>), after which he should pass six nights of <i>mānatta</i> penance. After this he ought to be absolved. Twenty monks in conclave may absolve him; if only one person short of twenty come together, he shall not be absolved; and in this case all the monks shall be considered blameworthy. This is the law. I now ask all the venerable ones in this assembly, are you pure or not (three times)? Venerable ones! this assembly is pure Silently therefore ye stand! So let it be.</p>
<h2>2 aniyata rules</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc37' href='#sc37'>SC 37</a> Venerable monks! the following rules relate to faults not capable of exact definition; they are two in number, and are found in the Vinaya, and are ordered to be repeated fortnightly (requiring suspension or penance according to the case).</p>
<h4>Aniyata 1</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc38' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a> If a monk (monk) occupy a screened and sheltered place, in common with a woman, and sit in a spot fit for the commission of sin, and at the same time indulge in licentious (unlawful) conversation with her if, for example, she be a faithful lay woman (<i>upāsika</i>) and they converse together on matters relating to the three laws, viz., pārājika, saṅghādisesa, pācittiya; and if this monk, sitting in the manner mentioned, say of his own accord: “I have broken these laws, and am therefore liable to the several punishments attached to the transgression, whether entire exclusion, or suspension and penance, or public confession,” then according to what this faithful laywoman shall report, respecting the crimes which the monk has acknowledged, such shall be his punishment.</p>
<h4>Aniyata 2</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc39' href='#sc39'>SC 39</a> If a monk consort with a woman in an open place, unfit for the commission of crime, but talk loosely with her, for example with a well-principled laywoman about the two laws, sanghadisesa, and pācittiya, and say respecting each of these of his own accord: “I have broken these laws and am liable to the punishment attached to such transgression” this monk shall be punished according to what the faithful laywoman reports. This also is a case in point.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc40' href='#sc40'>SC 40</a> Venerable monks! I have thus declared these two rules called undetermined. I demand of you all, is this assembly pure or not (three times). Venerable ones! this assembly is pure, and therefore you are silent. So let it be.</p>
<h2>30 nissaggiya pācittiya rules</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc41' href='#sc41'>SC 41</a> Venerable monks! I now proceed to declare the thirty Nissaggiya-pācittiya dhamma, to be recited fortnightly, as contained in the midst of the Vinaya (or book of precepts).</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc42' href='#sc42'>SC 42</a> If a monk, having finished a set of robes for himself, the Kathina cloth having been distributed, be presented with an additional garment, he may retain it ten days without consecration, but if he keep it beyond that time, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>

If it be enough to make him a robe, well! but if not, he may keep the piece by him a whole month, in order to obtain a further piece to make up the deficiency; but if he keep it longer than a month, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4>Nissaggiya Pācittya 4</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc45' href='#sc45'>SC 45</a> If a monk receive a piece of cloth from a bhikṣuṇī, not related to him, except in the way of justifiable exchange, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4>Nissaggiya Pācittya 5</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a> If a monk send one of his robes to a bhikṣuṇī, not a relative, to be washed or smoothed after it has been dyed, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4>Nissaggiya Pācittya 6</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc47' href='#sc47'>SC 47</a> If a monk ask a robe from a householder not a relative of his, or from the householder’s wife, except on special occasions, it is nissaggiya pācittiya. The special occasions are when his robe has been stolen, or lost, or burnt, or blown away.</p>
<h4>Nissaggiya Pācittya 7</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc48' href='#sc48'>SC 48</a> If a monk, under such circumstances, shall by any unguarded expression intimate a wish that this householder or his wife, neither of them being related to him, should give him a robe (or cloth for a robe), this monk may receive a just equivalent (for that which he has lost); if he takes more, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>
<h4>Nissaggiya Pācittya 8</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49'>SC 49</a> If a householder or his wife shall have collected money in order to provide a robe for a particular monk, and if this monk, before receiving it, and without any invitation, go to the house of the master of the family, and speak thus to him, “Excellent householder! purchase such and such a robe and give it me, because it is good!” If he obtain his request, it is nissaggiya pācittiya.</p>

If this causes the man to recollect his debt, well and good! but if the monk does not even thus procure the robe, and go back after this to the man to try to get it this is nissaggiya pācittiya. If he do not obtain the robe, he may either go himself, or send a messenger to the place whence the gift came and say: “The money which you sent some time ago as a present for the purchase of a robe for a particular monk, and which you entrusted to the care of such and such a person, has not been used for the benefit of the monk in question, you should go back and take it therefore, lest it be lost.” Such is the rule.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc160' href='#sc160'>SC 160</a> Venerable sirs! I have thus recited the ninety pācittiya laws; I now ask the entire assembly of monks, are ye pure from violation of these laws or not [three times]. Venerable sirs! This assembly is pure, and therefore ye are silent. So let it be.</p>
<h2>4 pātidesanīya rules</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc161' href='#sc161'>SC 161</a> Venerable sirs! The following four rules known as pātidesanīya are ordered to be recited fortnightly, and are taken from the Vinaya, or Book of Precepts.</p>
<h4>Pātidesanīya 1</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc162' href='#sc162'>SC 162</a> If a monk, in good health, enter a village and receive with his own hands food to eat from a bhikṣuṇī, not related to him, and eat it: this monk ought to confess his fault in the presence of the other monks, and say: “Venerable sirs! I have transgressed by bringing contempt on the law; I ought not to have done so; I now confess my fault to the venerable monks. This is called pātidesanīya.</p>
<h4>Pātidesanīya 2</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc163' href='#sc163'>SC 163</a> If a monk go to a layman’s house to eat, and a bhikṣuṇī, present in the same house, point out with her finger, and say: “Give this gruel to such and such an one;” or, “Give this rice to such and such an one,” the monks generally ought to speak to that bhikṣuṇī, and say: “Worthy sister! be still; wait till the monks have done eating.” If there be no monk (who has the courage) to speak thus to that bhikṣuṇī, then the one present (or the monks who are present) ought to confess their fault before the other monks, and say: “Venerable sirs! I have transgressed and brought contempt on the law; I ought not to have done so; I now confess my fault before the venerable brethren.” This is pātidesanīya.</p>
<h4>Pātidesanīya 3</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc164' href='#sc164'>SC 164</a> If certain families have been appointed by the assembly of monks to the houses of resort (whether for study or otherwise) for the monks, and if a monk, knowing such a family, go, whilst in good health, and with out any invitation, and receive in his hand food and eat it, this monk ought to confess his fault in the presence of the others, and say: “Venerable sirs! I have broken the law, and brought it into contempt, which I ought not to have done. I now confess my fault to you, venerable sirs! This is pātidesanīya.</p>
<h4>Pātidesanīya 4</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc165' href='#sc165'>SC 165</a> If a monk reside at a distance in a dangerous place, as a solitary ascetic, and do not previously warn his patrons, who reside beyond the precincts of his monastery, that they must not bring him food, and (in the face of the danger) reside within his precinct, and receive food there and eat it, except he is sick, this monk shall confess his fault to the rest, and say: “Venerable sirs! I have broken the law, and brought it into contempt. I now confess to you my sin.” This is pātidesanīya.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc237' href='#sc237'>SC 237</a> Excellent Sirs! I have thus repeated the seven adhikaraṇasamathas. I now demand of you all, Is thin assembly pure? [three times]. Brethren! this assembly is pure; silently, therefore, ye stand. So let it be.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc238' href='#sc238'>SC 238</a> Worthy Sirs! I have thus recited the Preface to the Sutra of Precepts; I have repeated the four Pārājika rules, the thirteen Saṅghādisesa rules, the two Aniyata rules, the thirty Nissagiya-pācittiya rules, the ninety Pācittiya rules the four Pātidesanīya rules, the one hundred Sekhiya rules, the seven Adhikaraṇasamatha rules. These, all taken from the Sutra of Precepts, are those which Buddha has declared ought to be repeated fortnightly. If there be any other laws of Buddha not herein contained, this assembly is well agreed, they ought to be observed.</p>
