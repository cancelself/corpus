<p><a class='ref wal' id='walE.2' href='#walE.2'>Wal E.2</a>In the first watch of the night he inclined his mind to direct knowledge: the realisation of the knowledge of the scopes of psychic potency. He wielded the manifold scopes of psychic potency.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='walE.3' href='#walE.3'>Wal E.3</a>That is to say: having been one, he became many; having been many, he became one; he appeared and vanished by means of the knowledge and vision that he wielded; he went unhindered with his body through a wall, through a cliff, through a rampart as though through space; he dived in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walked on water with his body unhindered as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travelled in space like a bird; with his hand he touched and stroked the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he exercised mastery with the body as far as the Brahmā world.</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='walE.14' href='#walE.14'>Wal E.14</a>With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he saw beings passing away and being reborn, beautiful and ugly, inferior and superior, going to fortunate and unfortunate destinations, and he understood how beings fare in accordance with their karma thus:</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='walE.20' href='#walE.20'>Wal E.20</a>He understood in accordance with reality the thoughts and examinations in the minds of other beings and persons with his mind.

When it was liberated there came the knowledge and vision, “I am liberated.” He understood, “Birth is ended, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to this existence.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='walE.25' href='#walE.25'>Wal E.25</a>Thus the <i>bodhisattva</i>, the Blessed One, while dwelling in Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjarā river at the root of the Bodhi tree, having finished his task, having done what had to be done, being fully Awakened, attained <span class='add'>the <i>samādhi</i> of</span> the fire element.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>1. Salutation by two Brahmas</span></h2>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal1.3' href='#wal1.3'>Wal 1.3</a>Then the two gods of Brahma’s retinue, like a strong man would bend his extended arm, or would extend his bended arm, vanished from the Brahma realm and appeared standing before the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal1.4' href='#wal1.4'>Wal 1.4</a>Then one of the gods of Brahma’s retinue spoke this verse:</p>

Bringing your achievement of non-conflict, wander in the world,<br>

There will be some who will understand the gem of the Dharma!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal1.6' href='#wal1.6'>Wal 1.6</a>The second god of Brahma’s retinue at that time spoke this verse:</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal1.9' href='#wal1.9'>Wal 1.9</a>Then the Blessed One, having arisen from that <i>samādhi</i>, on that occasion spoke this verse:</p>

<h2><span class='add'>2. The first meal</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.1' href='#wal2.1'>Wal 2.1</a>The Buddha, the Blessed One sat for seven days in one posture without moving and without being offered alms-food, experiencing the rapture and bliss of liberation.</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.3' href='#wal2.3'>Wal 2.3</a>Then a god who was a former friend, relative, or companion of the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika, for their welfare thought thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.4' href='#wal2.4'>Wal 2.4</a>“This Buddha, the Blessed One, dwells in Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjara river, at the root of the Bodhi tree soon after full Awakening, experiencing the rapture and bliss of liberation. The Buddha, the Blessed One has been seated for seven days in one posture without moving and without walking for alms-food. Therefore, should the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika be the first to offer alms-food, that would bring them benefit, welfare, and happiness for a long time. What if I, aiming at their happiness, encourage them to offer alms-food?”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.5' href='#wal2.5'>Wal 2.5</a>Then that god, having pervaded the merchant’s caravan of wagons with light, said this to the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika:</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.6' href='#wal2.6'>Wal 2.6</a>“Merchants, merchants! This Buddha, the Blessed One, dwells in Uruvelā on the bank of the Nerañjara river, at the root of the Bodhi tree soon after full Awakening, experiencing the rapture and bliss of liberation. The Buddha, the Blessed One has been seated for seven days in one posture without moving and without being offered alms-food. Therefore, you should be the first to offer alms-food, which will bring you benefit, welfare, and happiness for a long time.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.7' href='#wal2.7'>Wal 2.7</a>Then the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika thought thus: “This Buddha cannot be an ordinary person, nor can this be an ordinary declaration of the Dharma, if even this god encourages us to offer alms-food to him, the Tathāgata, arahant, and fully Awakened Buddha.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.8' href='#wal2.8'>Wal 2.8</a>Then the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika took much rice-cake and honey-lumps to the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.9' href='#wal2.9'>Wal 2.9</a>Having approached the Blessed One and bowed with their heads at his feet they stood at one side and said to him:</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.11' href='#wal2.11'>Wal 2.11</a>Then the Blessed One thought thus: “If I were to accept alms-food from these with my own hands, this would be like the followers of other religions and would not be appropriate for me. What if I were to consider how the fully Awakened Buddhas of the past accepted alms-food for the welfare of beings?”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.12' href='#wal2.12'>Wal 2.12</a>Gods declared to the Blessed One: “Venerable Sir, the fully Awakened Buddhas of the past accepted alms-food in a bowl, for the welfare of beings.” The Blessed One, extending his knowledge & vision, also knew that the fully Awakened Buddhas of the past accepted alms-food in a bowl, for the welfare of beings.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal2.13' href='#wal2.13'>Wal 2.13</a>Then the Blessed One had need of a bowl.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>3. The bowl</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal3.1' href='#wal3.1'>Wal 3.1</a>Then the Four Great Kings, knowing of the Blessed One’s need of a bowl, had four stone bowls made from a rock mountain, not crafted or finished by humans, clear, clean, odourless, and brought them to the Blessed One.</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal3.5' href='#wal3.5'>Wal 3.5</a>Then the Blessed One thought thus: “If I were to accept a bowl from one of the Great Kings, the other three might change <span class='add'>their minds</span>. If I accept two or three, the others might change <span class='add'>their minds</span>. Why do I not accept the bowls from all four of the Great Kings and transform them into one?”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal3.6' href='#wal3.6'>Wal 3.6</a>Then the Blessed One, having accepted bowls from the Four Great Kings transformed them into one.</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal3.8' href='#wal3.8'>Wal 3.8</a>Then the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika addressed the Blessed One:</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal3.10' href='#wal3.10'>Wal 3.10</a>Then the Blessed One spoke the following in appreciation of the gift of the merchants Tripusa and Bhallika:</p>

<h2><span class='add'>4. The Buddha’s illness and the request of Māra</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal4.1' href='#wal4.1'>Wal 4.1</a>Then the Blessed One, after taking the alms-food from the merchants Tripusa and Bhalika ate his meal in that place.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal4.2' href='#wal4.2'>Wal 4.2</a>Then the Blessed One became sick with a wind-ailment from the honey-lumps.</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.1' href='#wal21.1'>Wal 21.1</a>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, I am freed from all snares, both human and divine. You too are freed from all snares, both human and divine. Wander, monks, for the welfare of the many-folk, for the happiness of the many-folk, out of compassion for the benefit of the world, for the welfare and happiness of gods and men. Let not two go by the one road! Also, I will go to Uruvelā, to the village of Senāyana.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.2' href='#wal21.2'>Wal 21.2</a><span class='add'>Then Māra the wicked thought: “The Blessed One has addressed the monks thus: ‘Monks, I am freed from all snares, both human and divine.

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.3' href='#wal21.3'>Wal 21.3</a>Then Māra the wicked transformed his body into the appearance of a student and approached the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.4' href='#wal21.4'>Wal 21.4</a>Having approached at that time he spoke this verse:</p>

How can he imagine he is free?<br>
You are tied with great ties!<br>
Ascetic, you will not escape me!”</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.5' href='#wal21.5'>Wal 21.5</a>Then the Blessed One thought thus: “Māra the wicked has approached me and created a vision.” Knowing this, the Blessed One at that time spoke this verse:</p>

<p>“I am free from all snares,<br>

I know you, wicked one!<br>
You are destroyed right here, terminator!”</p>

<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.6' href='#wal21.6'>Wal 21.6</a>Then Māra the wicked thought: “The ascetic Gotama knows me by encompassing my mind with his.” Realising this, sad, depressed, and remorseful, he vanished right there.</p>
<p><a class='ref wal' id='wal21.7' href='#wal21.7'>Wal 21.7</a>The Blessed One addressed the monks once more: “Monks, I am freed from all snares, both human and divine. You too are freed from all snares, both human and divine. Wander, monks, for the welfare of the many-folk (…as before, up until…) Also, I will go to Uruvelā, to the village of Senāyana.”</p>
