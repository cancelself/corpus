<h1>24. The Four Analytical Knowledges</h1>
</header>
<p>Herein, monastics, what are the four analytical knowledges?</p>
<p>They are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The analytical knowledge of meaning,</li>
<li>the analytical knowledge of the way things are,</li>
<li>the analytical knowledge of language,</li>
<li>the analytical knowledge of inspired speech.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The analytical knowledge of meaning is what?</p>
<p>That is to say, the unchanging knowledge of the ultimate truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The analytical knowledge of the way things are is what?</p>
<p>The unchanging knowledge of things without pollutants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The analytical knowledge of language is what?</p>
<p>The unchanging knowledge of utterances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The analytical knowledge of inspired speech is what?</p>
<p>What is suitable and facile talk: the unchanging and clear knowledge one dwelling in concentration has <span class='add'>(of this)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the four analytical knowledges.</p>
