People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns walk on almstour during the rains, trampling down the crops and grasses, injuring life that is one-facultied, bringing many small creatures to destruction?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can these nuns … during the rains … bringing many small creatures to destruction?” …</p>
