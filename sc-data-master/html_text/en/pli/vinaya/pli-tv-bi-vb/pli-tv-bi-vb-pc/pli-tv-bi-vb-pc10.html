Now at that time there was a festival on a mountain-top in Rājagaha. The group of six nuns went to see the festival on the mountain-top. People … spread it about saying: “How can nuns come to see dancing and singing and music, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the group of six nuns go to see … music?” …</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the group of six nuns go to see … music? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should go to see dancing or singing or music, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
