<h1>Nuns’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 60</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.60' href='#Bi-Pc.60'>Bi-Pc.60</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain nun together with a man, the one with the other, made a boil burst that had formed on the lower part of her body. Then that man began to violate that nun. She cried out in distress. Nuns, having run up, spoke thus to that nun: “Why do you, lady, cry out in distress?” Then that nun told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this nun together with a man, the one with the other, make a boil burst that had formed on the lower part of her body?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun … lower part of her body?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun … lower part of her body? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, without having obtained permission from an Order or from a group, should together with a man, the one with the other, make a boil or a scab that has formed on the lower part of her body burst or break or let it be washed or smeared or bound up or unbound, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
