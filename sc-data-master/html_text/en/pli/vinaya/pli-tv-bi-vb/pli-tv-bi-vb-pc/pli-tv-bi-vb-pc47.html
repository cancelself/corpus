<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.47' href='#Bi-Pc.47'>Bi-Pc.47</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā, not having given up her household robe, made use of it. Other menstruating nuns did not obtain it. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, not having given up her household robe, make use of it?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … makes use of it?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … make use of it? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, not having given up her household robe, should make use of it, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Not having given up, should make use of it</span> means: <span class='gloss'>if, having made use of it for two or three days, having washed it on the fourth day, she makes use of it, not having given it up to a nun or to a probationer or to a female novice, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
