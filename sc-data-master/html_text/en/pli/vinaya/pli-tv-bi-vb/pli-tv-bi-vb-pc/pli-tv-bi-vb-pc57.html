<h1>Nuns’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 57</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.57' href='#Bi-Pc.57'>Bi-Pc.57</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time several nuns, having kept the rains in a village residence, went to Sāvatthī. Nuns spoke thus to these nuns: “Where did the ladies keep the rains? Was an Order of monks <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.314' href='#Vin.4.314'>PTS vp Pali 4.314</a> ‘invited’?”</p>
<p>“Ladies, we did not ‘invite’ an Order of monks.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns, having spent the rains, not ‘invite’ an Order of monks?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … did not ‘invite’ an Order of monks?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns … not ‘invite’ an Order of monks? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, having kept the rains, should not ‘invite’ both Orders in respect of three matters: what was seen or heard or suspected, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.57.2.1' href='#Bi-Pc.57.2.1'>Bi-Pc.57.2.1</a> <span class='term'>Whatever</span> means: <span class='gloss'>… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Having kept the rains</span> means: <span class='gloss'>having kept the first three months or the last three months.</span></p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will not ‘invite’ both Orders in respect of three matters: what was seen or heard or <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.355' href='#BD.3.355'>BD 3.355</a> suspected,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.57.2.2' href='#Bi-Pc.57.2.2'>Bi-Pc.57.2.2</a> There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about, she does not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
