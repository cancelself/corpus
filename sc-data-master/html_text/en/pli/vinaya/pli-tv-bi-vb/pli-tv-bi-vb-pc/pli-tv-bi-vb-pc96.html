<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.96' href='#Bi-Pc.96'>Bi-Pc.96</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.345' href='#Vin.4.345'>PTS vp Pali 4.345</a> time a certain nun entered a village for almsfood without her vest. While she was on the high road gusts of wind blew up her outer cloak. People shouted out: “Beautiful is the waist of the lady.” That nun, being made fun of by the people, became ashamed. Then that nun, having gone to a dwelling, told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this nun enter a village without her vest?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that this nun … without her vest?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun enter a village without her vest? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should enter a village without her vest, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Without a vest</span> means: <span class='gloss'>without a vest.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Vest</span> means: <span class='gloss'>from below the collar-bone to above the navel, for the sake of covering this.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Should enter a village</span> means: <span class='gloss'>in going beyond the enclosure of a village that is fenced in, there is an offence of expiation. In entering the precincts of a village that is not fenced in, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>

<p class='end'>The Ninth Division: that on a sunshade</p>
<p>Recited, ladies, are the hundred and sixty-six rules for offences of expiation. Concerning them, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The ladies are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I understand this.</p>
