<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.41' href='#Bi-Pc.41'>Bi-Pc.41</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a bold design was made in a picture gallery in King Pasenadi of Kosala’s pleasure grove. Many people went to see the picture gallery. The group of six nuns also went to see the picture gallery. People … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns go to see the picture gallery, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns go to see a picture gallery?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns went to see a picture gallery?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can this group of six nuns go to see a picture gallery? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should go to see a king’s pleasure house or a picture gallery or a park or a pleasure grove or a lotus pond, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p>If she goes to see, there is an offence of wrong-doing. Standing where she sees, there is an offence of expiation. Having left the region of sight, if she sees again, there is an offence of expiation. If she goes to see one or the other, there is an offence of wrong-doing. Standing where she sees, there is an offence of expiation. Having left the region of sight, if she sees again, there is an offence of expiation. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.299' href='#Vin.4.299'>PTS vp Pali 4.299</a> </p>
