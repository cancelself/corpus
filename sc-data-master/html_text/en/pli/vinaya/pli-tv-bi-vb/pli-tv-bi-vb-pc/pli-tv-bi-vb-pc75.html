<h1>Nuns’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 75</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.75' href='#Bi-Pc.75'>Bi-Pc.75</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained when they had completed twelve years (of standing but) were not agreed upon by the Order. They were ignorant … <span class='pe'><a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc74/en/horner#Bi-Pc.74.1'>Bi-Pc.74.1</a>. <i>Instead of</i> less than twelve years (of standing) <i>read</i> when they have completed twelve years (of standing but) are not agreed upon by the Order.</span> … “… It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased …” and having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give a nun who has completed twelve years (of standing) the agreement to ordain. And thus, monks, should it be given: That nun who has completed twelve years (of standing), having approached the Order, having arranged her upper robe over one shoulder, having honoured the feet of the senior nuns, having sat down on her haunches, having saluted with joined palms, should speak thus to it: <span class='kamma'>‘Ladies, I, so and so, a nun who has completed twelve years (of standing), request the Order for the agreement to ordain.’ And a second time it should be requested … And a third time it should be requested.</span> This nun should be tested by the Order thinking: ‘This nun is experienced, she is conscientious.’ If she is both ignorant and unconscientious it should not be given. If she is ignorant but conscientious it should not be given. If she is experienced but unconscientious, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.386' href='#BD.3.386'>BD 3.386</a> it should not be given. If she is both experienced and conscientious, it should be given. And thus, monks, should it be given: The Order should be informed by an experienced, competent nun, saying: <span class='kamma'>‘Ladies, let the Order listen to me. This nun so and so who has completed twelve years (of standing) requests the Order for the agreement to ordain. If it seems right to the Order … <span class='pe'><i>cf.</i> <a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc63/en/horner#Bi-Pc.63.1'>Bi-Pc.63.1</a>, etc.</span> … So do I understand this.’</span>”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having rebuked the nuns in many a figure for their weakness in maintaining themselves … “… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun who has completed twelve years (of standing but) who is not agreed upon by the Order should ordain, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Completed twelve years</span> means: <span class='gloss'>attained to twelve years.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Not agreed upon</span> means: <span class='gloss'>the agreement to ordain is not given by a (formal) act at which the motion is followed by one proclamation. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.331' href='#Vin.4.331'>PTS vp Pali 4.331</a> </span></p>

<p>There is no offence if she ordains when she has completed twelve years (of standing) and is agreed upon by the Order; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
