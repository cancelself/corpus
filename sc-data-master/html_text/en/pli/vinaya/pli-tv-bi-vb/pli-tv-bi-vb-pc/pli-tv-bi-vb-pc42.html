<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.42' href='#Bi-Pc.42'>Bi-Pc.42</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns made use of a sofa and of a divan. People, engaged in touring the dwelling place, having seen (them) … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns make use of a sofa and of a divan, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns make use of a sofa and of a divan?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns made use of a … divan?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns make use of a sofa and of <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.327' href='#BD.3.327'>BD 3.327</a> a divan? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should make use of a sofa or of a divan, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Sofa</span> means: <span class='gloss'>it is called of exceeding measure.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Divan</span> means: <span class='gloss'>it is made having brought hair (stuffing).</span></p>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.42.2.2' href='#Bi-Pc.42.2.2'>Bi-Pc.42.2.2</a> There is no offence if, having cut down the legs of the sofa, she makes use of it; if, having cut out the hair (stuffing) from the divan, she makes use of it; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
