<h1>Nuns’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 29</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.29' href='#Bi-Pc.29'>Bi-Pc.29</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the family who supported the nun Thullanandā spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “If we, lady, are able, we will give robe-material for the Order of nuns.” Now at that time nuns, having kept the rains-retreat, collected together wishing to distribute robe-material. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to these nuns: “Wait, ladies, there is for the Order of nuns an expectation of robe-material.” The nuns spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “Do go, lady, and find out about this robe-material.” The nun Thullanandā approached that family; having approached she spoke thus to the people: “Sirs, do give robe-material for the Order of nuns.” They said: “Lady, we are not able to give robe-material for the Order of nuns.” The nun Thullanandā told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā, when an expectation of robe-material is not sure, let the robe-season pass?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … let the robe-season pass?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … let the robe-season pass? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, when an expectation of robe-material is not sure, should let the robe-season pass, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>When an expectation of robe-material is not sure</span> means: <span class='gloss'>if they say, “If we are able, we will give, we will make,” (but their) word becomes broken.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Robe-season</span> means: <span class='gloss'>the last month of the rainy season when the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kaṭhina</i> cloth is not (formally) made, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.287' href='#Vin.4.287'>PTS vp Pali 4.287</a> the five months when it is (formally) made.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Should let the robe-season pass</span> means: <span class='gloss'>if she lets pass the last day of the rainy season when the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kaṭhina</i> cloth is not (formally) made, there is an offence of expiation.

If she is in doubt as to whether the robe-material is not sure … offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that the robe-material is sure when it is not sure … no offence. If she thinks that the robe-material is not sure when it is sure, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether the robe-material is sure, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
