<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.44' href='#Bi-Pc.44'>Bi-Pc.44</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns did household work. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns do household work?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns do household work?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns do household work? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should do household work, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
