<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.84' href='#Bi-Pc.84'>Bi-Pc.84</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns used sunshades and sandals. People … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns use sunshades and sandals, like women householders who enjoy pleasures of the senses?” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns use sunshades and sandals?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks … and sandals?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can … and sandals? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“Whatever nun should use a sunshade and sandals, there is an offence of expiation.”</p>
<p>And thus this rule of training for nuns came to be laid down by the lord.</p>

They told this matter to the lord. He said: “Monks, I allow a sunshade and sandals to a nun who is ill. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun who is not ill should use a sunshade and sandals, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
