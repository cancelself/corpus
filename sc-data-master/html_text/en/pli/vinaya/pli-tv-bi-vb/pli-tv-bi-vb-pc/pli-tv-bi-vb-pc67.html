<h1>Nuns’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 67</h1>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.67' href='#Bi-Pc.67'>Bi-Pc.67</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained a girl married for full twelve years and who had trained for two years in the six rules, but who was not agreed upon by the Order. Nuns spoke thus: “Come, probationers, … <span class='pe'><a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc64/en/horner#Bi-Pc.64.1'>Bi-Pc.64.1</a></span> …” … “How can these nuns ordain a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules, but who is not agreed upon by the Order?” … he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give the agreement as to ordination to a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules. And thus, monks, should it be given: That girl married for full twelve years <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.324' href='#Vin.4.324'>PTS vp Pali 4.324</a> and who has trained for two years in the six rules, having approached the Order … <span class='pe'><a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc63/en/horner#Bi-Pc.63.1'>Bi-Pc.63.1</a></span> … should speak thus: <span class='kamma'>‘Ladies, I, so and so, a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained under the lady so and so for two years in the six rules, request the Order for the agreement as to ordination.’ And a second time … <span class='pe'><a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc63/en/horner#Bi-Pc.63.1'>Bi-Pc.63.1</a>. <i>Instead of</i> probationer <i>read</i> girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules; <i>instead of</i> agreement as to training for two years in the six rules <i>read</i> agreement as to ordination</span> …</span> <span class='kamma'>‘So do I understand this.’</span>”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having rebuked these nuns in many a figure for their weakness in maintaining themselves … “… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should ordain a girl married for full twelve years and who has trained for two years in the six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the Order, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
