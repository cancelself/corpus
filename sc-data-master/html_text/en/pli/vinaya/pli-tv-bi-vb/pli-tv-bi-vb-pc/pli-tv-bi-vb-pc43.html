<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns spin yarn?”</p>

<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the group of six nuns spin yarn? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should spin yarn, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
