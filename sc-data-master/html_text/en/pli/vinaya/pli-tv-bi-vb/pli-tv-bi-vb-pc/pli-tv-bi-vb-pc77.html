<h1>Nuns’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 77</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.77' href='#Bi-Pc.77'>Bi-Pc.77</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain probationer, having approached the nun Thullanandā, asked for the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>upasampadā</i> ordination. The nun Thullanandā, having said to that probationer, “If you, lady, will give me a robe, then will I ordain you,” neither ordained her nor made an effort to get her ordained. Then that probationer told this matter to the nuns. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā, having said … neither ordain her nor make an effort to get her ordained?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … nor made an effort to get her ordained?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … nor make an effort to get her ordained? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, having said to a probationer: ‘If you, lady, will give me a robe, then will I ordain you,’ (yet) if she is not afterwards prevented, should neither ordain her nor should make an effort to get her ordained, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Probationer</span> means: <span class='gloss'>one who has trained for two years in the six rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>‘If you, lady, will give me a robe, then will I ordain you’</span> means: <span class='gloss'>then will I confer the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>upasampadā</i> ordination on you.</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Should neither ordain her</span> means: <span class='gloss'>should not herself ordain her.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Nor should make an effort to get her ordained</span> means : should not command another.</p>
<p>If she thinks, “I will neither ordain her nor make an effort to get her ordained,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.</p>
