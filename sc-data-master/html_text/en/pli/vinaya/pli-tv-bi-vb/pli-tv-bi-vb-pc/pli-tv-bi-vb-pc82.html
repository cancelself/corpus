<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.82' href='#Bi-Pc.82'>Bi-Pc.82</a> … At Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained every year; there were not sufficient dwellings. People … spread it about saying: “How can these nuns ordain every year? There are not sufficient dwellings.” Nuns heard these people who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain every year?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as it is said, monks, that nuns ordain every year?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns ordain every year? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of raining:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should ordain every year, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
