<h1>Nuns’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 64</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.64' href='#Bi-Pc.64'>Bi-Pc.64</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained a probationer who had trained for two years in the six rules (but) who was not agreed upon by the Order. Nuns spoke thus: “Come, probationers, find out about this, give this, convey this, make this allowable.” These spoke thus: “Ladies, we are not probationers, we are nuns.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns ordain a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the Order?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns ordained … not agreed upon by the Order?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns ordain … not agreed upon by the Order? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … and having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“I allow you, monks, to give the agreement as to ordination to a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules. And thus, monks, should it be given: That probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules, having approached the Order … <span class='pe'><a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc63/en/horner#Bi-Pc.63.1'>Bi-Pc.63.1</a></span> … should speak thus: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.321' href='#Vin.4.321'>PTS vp Pali 4.321</a> ‘<span class='kamma'>Ladies, I, so and so, a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules under the lady so and so, request the Order <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.368' href='#BD.3.368'>BD 3.368</a> for the agreement as to ordination.’ And a second time … <span class='pe'><a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc63/en/horner#Bi-Pc.63.1'>Bi-Pc.63.1</a> <i>instead of</i> probationer <i>read</i> probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules <i>instead of</i> agreement as to training for two years in the six rules <i>read</i> agreement as to ordination.</span> … So do I understand this.’</span>”</p>
<p>Then the lord, having rebuked the nuns in many a figure for their weakness in maintaining themselves … “… this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should ordain a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules (but) who is not agreed upon by the Order, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Two years</span> means: <span class='gloss'>two years.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Has trained</span> means: <span class='gloss'>has trained in the six rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Not agreed upon</span> means: <span class='gloss'>the agreement as to ordination is not given by a (formal) act at which the motion is followed by one proclamation.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Should ordain</span> means: <span class='gloss'>… <span class='pe'><a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc61/en/horner#Bi-Pc.61.2.1'>Bi-Pc.61.2.1</a></span> …</span></p>
<p>There is no offence if she ordains a probationer who has trained for two years in the six rules and who is agreed upon by the Order; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
