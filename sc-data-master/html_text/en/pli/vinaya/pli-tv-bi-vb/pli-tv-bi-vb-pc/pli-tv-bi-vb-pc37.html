Now at that time nuns walked without a weapon on almstour within (their own) region (when this was) agreed upon as dangerous, frightening. Bad men assaulted them. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns … dangerous, frightening?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns … dangerous, frightening?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns … dangerous, frightening? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should walk without a weapon on alms-tour within (her own) region (when this is) agreed upon as dangerous, frightening, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
