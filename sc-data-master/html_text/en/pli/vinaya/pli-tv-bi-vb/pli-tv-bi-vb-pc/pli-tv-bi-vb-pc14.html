<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.14' href='#Bi-Pc.14'>Bi-Pc.14</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā, stood together with and talked with a man, the one with the other, on a carriage road and in a cul-de-sac and at cross-roads, and she whispered in his ear and she dismissed the nun who was her companion. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the lady Thullanandā stand together with … at cross-roads, and whisper in his ear and dismiss the nun who is her companion?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā stood together with … and dismissed the nun who is her companion?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā stand together with … and dismiss the nun who is her companion? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.271' href='#Vin.4.271'>PTS vp Pali 4.271</a> </p>
