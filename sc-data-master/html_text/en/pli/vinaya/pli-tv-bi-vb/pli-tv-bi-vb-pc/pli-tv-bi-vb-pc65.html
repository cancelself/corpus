<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.65' href='#Bi-Pc.65'>Bi-Pc.65</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time nuns ordained a girl married for less than twelve years. These were not able to endure cold, heat, hunger, thirst, contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind and sun, creeping things, abusive hurtful language; they were not able to endure bodily feelings which arising are painful, acute, sharp, shooting, disagreeable, miserable, deadly. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can nuns ordain a girl married for less than twelve years?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns ordained … married for less than twelve years?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.322' href='#Vin.4.322'>PTS vp Pali 4.322</a> </p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns ordain a girl married for less than twelve years? Monks, a girl married for less than twelve years is not able to endure cold … bodily feelings … miserable, deadly. It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should ordain a girl married for less than twelve years, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

If she is in doubt as to whether it is less than twelve years … offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that twelve years are completed when it is less than twelve years … no offence. If she thinks that it is less than twelve years when twelve years are completed, there is an offence of wrong-doing.
