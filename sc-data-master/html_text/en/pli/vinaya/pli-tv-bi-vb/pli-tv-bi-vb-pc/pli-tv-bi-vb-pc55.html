<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.55' href='#Bi-Pc.55'>Bi-Pc.55</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a certain nun, walking for alms along a certain road in Sāvatthī, approached a certain family; having approached, she sat down on an appointed seat. Then these people, having offered food to this nun, spoke thus: “Lady, other nuns may also come.” Then this nun, thinking: “How may these nuns not come?” having approached the nuns, spoke thus: “Ladies, in such and such a place there are fierce dogs, a wild bull, the place is a swamp, do not go there.” But a certain nun, walking for alms along that road, approached that family; having approached, she sat down on an appointed seat. Then these people, having offered food to that nun, spoke thus: “Why do not the other nuns come, lady?” Then this nun told this matter to those people. The people … spread it about, saying: “How can that nun be grudging as to families?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that a nun was grudging as to families?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can a nun be grudging as to families? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should be one who is grudging as to families, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
