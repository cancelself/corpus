<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.28' href='#Bi-Pc.28'>Bi-Pc.28</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā gave recluses’ robe-material to players and to dancers and to female tumblers and to female conjurors and to drummers, saying: “Do praise me in public.” The players and the dancers and the tumblers and the conjurors and the drummers praised the nun Thullanandā in public, saying: “The lady Thullanandā is very learned, she is a repeater, she is wise, she is skilled in giving talk on <i lang='pli' translate='no'>dhamma</i>. Give for the lady, make for the lady.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.299' href='#BD.3.299'>BD 3.299</a> “How can the lady Thullanandā give recluses’ robe-material to a householder?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā gave recluses’ robe-material to a householder?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā give recluses’ robe-material to a householder? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should give recluses’ robe-material to a householder or to a wanderer or to a female wanderer, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
