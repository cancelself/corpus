Now at that time the nun Thullanandā thinking: “I will ordain a probationer,” having had monks who were elders convened, having seen sumptuous solid foods and soft foods, saying: “Masters, I will not ordain the probationer yet,” having dismissed the monks who were elders, having had Devadatta, Kokālika, Kaṭamorakatissaka, the son of the lady Khaṇḍā and Samuddadatta convened, she ordained the probationer. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can the lady Thullanandā ordain a probationer by showing favouritism to (monks) placed on probation?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā ordained a probationer by showing favouritism to (monks) placed on probation?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … (monks) placed on probation? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should ordain a probationer by showing favouritism to (monks) placed on probation, there is an offence of expiation.</span>”</p>
