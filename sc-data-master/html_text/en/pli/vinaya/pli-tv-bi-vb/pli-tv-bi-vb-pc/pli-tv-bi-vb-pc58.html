<h1>Nuns’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 58</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.58' href='#Bi-Pc.58'>Bi-Pc.58</a> … among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks, having approached a nunnery, exhorted the group of six nuns. Nuns spoke thus to the group of six nuns: “Come, ladies, we will go for exhortation.”</p>
<p>“Well, ladies, we would go for the sake of exhortation, (but) the group of the six masters exhort us, having come to this place itself.” Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six nuns not go for exhortation?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six nuns do not go for exhortation?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the group of six nuns <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.315' href='#Vin.4.315'>PTS vp Pali 4.315</a> not go for exhortation? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should not go for exhortation or for communion, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

<p> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.58.2.1' href='#Bi-Pc.58.2.1'>Bi-Pc.58.2.1</a> <span class='term'>Whatever</span> means: <span class='gloss'>… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Exhortation</span> means: <span class='gloss'>the eight important rules.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Communion</span> means: <span class='gloss'>one (formal) act, one recitation, an equal training. If she thinks, “I will not go for <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.357' href='#BD.3.357'>BD 3.357</a> exhortation or for communion,” in throwing off the responsibility, there is an offence of expiation.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pc.58.2.2' href='#Bi-Pc.58.2.2'>Bi-Pc.58.2.2</a> There is no offence if there is an obstacle; if, having looked about for a nun as a companion, she does not get the chance; if she is ill; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
