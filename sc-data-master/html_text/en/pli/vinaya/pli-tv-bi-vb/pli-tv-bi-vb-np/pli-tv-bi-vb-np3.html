<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-NP.3' href='#Bi-NP.3'>Bi-NP.3</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā, having exchanged a robe with a certain nun, made use of it. Then that nun, having folded up that robe, laid it aside. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to that nun: “Lady, that robe <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.247' href='#Vin.4.247'>PTS vp Pali 4.247</a> which was exchanged by you with me, where is that robe?” Then that nun, having taken out that robe, showed it to the nun Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā spoke thus to that nun: “Lady, take back your robe, give me this robe. That which is yours is yours, that which is mine is mine. Give this to me, take away your own,” and she tore it away. Then that nun told this matter to the nuns … to the monks. The monks … to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thullanandā … tore it away?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … tear it away? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, having exchanged a robe with a nun, should afterwards speak thus: ‘Lady, take your robe, give this robe to me. That which is yours is yours, that which is mine is mine. Give this to me, take away <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.221' href='#BD.3.221'>BD 3.221</a> your own,’ (and) should tear it away or should cause (another) to tear it away, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.</span>”</p>

<p> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-NP.3.2.1' href='#Bi-NP.3.2.1'>Bi-NP.3.2.1</a> <span class='term'>Whatever</span> means: <span class='gloss'>… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>With a nun</span> means: <span class='gloss'>with another nun.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Robe</span> means: <span class='gloss'>any one robe of the six (kinds of) robes (including) the least one fit for assignment.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Having exchanged</span> means: <span class='gloss'>something large for something small or something small for something large.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Should tear it away</span> means: if she tears it away herself, there is an offence of’ expiation involving forfeiture.</p>
<p><span class='term'>Should cause (another) to tear it away</span> means: <span class='gloss'>if she commands another, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If having commanded once, she then tears many away, it is to be forfeited. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: <span class='kamma'>‘Ladies, having exchanged this robe with a nun, it was torn away by me; it is to be forfeited. I forfeit it to the Order’</span> … <span class='kamma'>‘the Order should give back … let the ladies give back … I will give back (this robe) to the lady.’</span></span></p>

If she thinks that she is ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that she is not ordained when she is not ordained, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</p>
