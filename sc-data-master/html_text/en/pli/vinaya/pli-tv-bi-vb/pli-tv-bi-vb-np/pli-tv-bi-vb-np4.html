<h1>Nuns’ Forfeiture (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Nissaggiya</i>) 4</h1>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-NP.4' href='#Bi-NP.4'>Bi-NP.4</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the nun Thullanandā came to be ill. Then a certain lay-follower approached the nun Thullanandā, and having approached he spoke thus to the nun Thullanandā: “What, lady, is your discomfort? What may be brought (for you)?”</p>
<p>“Sir, I am in need of ghee.”</p>
<p>Then that lay-follower, having for a <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kahāpaṇa</i> brought ghee from the house of a certain shopkeeper, gave it to the nun Thullanandā. The nun Thullanandā said: “I am not in need of ghee, sir, I am in need of oil.” Then that lay-follower approached that shopkeeper, and having approached he spoke thus to that shopkeeper:</p>
<p>“The lady says that she does not need ghee, master, she needs oil. You take the ghee (and) give me the oil.”</p>
<p>“If we, master, take back again goods that were bought, when will our goods be sold? Ghee was taken owing to the purchase of ghee; give for the purchase of oil (and) you shall take oil”</p>
<p>Then that lay-follower … spread it about, saying: “How can this lady Thullanandā, having had one thing asked for, then have another thing asked for?” Nuns heard this lay-follower who … spread it about. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about … Then these nuns told this matter to the monks. The monks … to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that the nun Thulla <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.224' href='#BD.3.224'>BD 3.224</a> nandā, having had one thing asked for, had another thing asked for?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.249' href='#Vin.4.249'>PTS vp Pali 4.249</a> the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can the nun Thullanandā … have another thing asked for? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, having had one thing asked for, should have another thing asked for, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>

<p> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-NP.4.2.1' href='#Bi-NP.4.2.1'>Bi-NP.4.2.1</a> <span class='term'>Nun</span> means: <span class='gloss'>… nun is to be understood in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Having had one thing asked for</span> means: <span class='gloss'>having had anything whatever asked for.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Should have another asked for</span> means: <span class='gloss'>excepting that (thing), if she has another asked for, in the request there is an offence of wrong-doing. It is to be forfeited on acquisition. It should be forfeited to an Order or to a group or to one nun. And thus, monks, should it be forfeited: “Ladies, having had this thing asked for, the other thing asked for is to be forfeited by me. I forfeit it to the Order.” … “… the Order should give back … let the ladies give back … I will give back (this thing) to the lady.”</span></p>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-NP.4.2.2' href='#Bi-NP.4.2.2'>Bi-NP.4.2.2</a> If she thinks that one thing is another thing and has the other thing asked for, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she is in doubt as to whether one thing … If she thinks that an identical thing is another thing … offence of expiation involving forfeiture. If she thinks that another thing is an identical thing (and) has the identical thing asked for, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she is in doubt as to whether it is an identical thing (and) has an identical thing asked for, there is an offence of wrong-doing. If she thinks that it is an identical thing when it is an identical thing, there is no offence.</p>
