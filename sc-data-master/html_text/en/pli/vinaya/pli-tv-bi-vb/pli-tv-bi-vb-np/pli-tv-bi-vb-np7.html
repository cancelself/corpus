<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-NP.7' href='#Bi-NP.7'>Bi-NP.7</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time lay-followers, having made a voluntary collection for robe-material for the Order of nuns, having laid aside what was necessary in a certain cloak-seller’s house, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.252' href='#Vin.4.252'>PTS vp Pali 4.252</a> having approached the nuns, spoke thus: “Ladies, in such and such a cloak-seller’s house what is necessary for robe-material is laid aside. Having had the robe-material brought from there, distribute it.”</p>
<p>And the nuns, although having themselves asked for what was necessary, yet having got medicine in exchange, made use of it. The lay-followers, having found out … spread it about, saying: “How can these nuns get something in exchange for what was necessary (and) appointed for another thing, destined for another thing, belonging to an Order, (and) that they themselves asked for?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, monks, that nuns got something in exchange … that they themselves asked for?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How, monks, can nuns get something in exchange … that they themselves asked for? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun should get something in exchange for what was necessary (and) appointed for another thing, destined for another thing, belonging to an <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.232' href='#BD.3.232'>BD 3.232</a> Order, (and) that she herself asked for, there is an offence of expiation involving forfeiture.”</span></p>
