<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Sk.75.2.2' href='#Bi-Sk.75.2.2'>Bi-Sk.75.2.2</a> Now at that time ill nuns were (too) scrupulous to ease themselves and spit in the water. They told this matter to the lord. He said:</p>
<p>“I allow, monks, a nun if she is ill to ease herself and spit in the water. And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>‘I will not ease myself or spit in the water, if not ill,’ is a training to be observed.</span>”</p>
<p>If she is not ill she should not ease herself or spit in the water. Whoever out of disrespect, if not ill … offence of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>There is no offence if it is unintentional; if she is not thinking; if she does not know; if she is ill; if done on dry land she pours water over it; if there are accidents; if she is mad, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
