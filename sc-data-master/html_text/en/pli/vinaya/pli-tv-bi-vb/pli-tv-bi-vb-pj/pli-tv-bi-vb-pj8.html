<h1>Nuns’ Defeat (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pārājika</i>) 8</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pj.8' href='#Bi-Pj.8'>Bi-Pj.8</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six nuns, filled with desire, for the sake of following what was verily not the rule, consented to taking hold of the hand of a male person who was filled with desire, and they consented to taking hold of the edge of (his) outer robe, and they stood and they talked and they went to a rendezvous and they consented to a man’s approaching (them) and they entered into a covered place and they disposed the body for such a purpose. Those who were modest nuns … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the group of six nuns, filled with desire, for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, consent to … and stand and talk and go to a rendezvous … and enter … and dispose …?” “It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How, monks, can the group of six nuns … consent to … dispose the body for such a purpose? It is not, monks, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, let the nuns set forth this rule of training:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever nun, filled with desire, for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, should consent to taking hold of the hand of a male person who is filled with desire or should consent to taking hold of the edge of (his) outer cloak or should stand or should talk or should go to a rendezvous <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.221' href='#Vin.4.221'>PTS vp Pali 4.221</a> also becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion, she is a doer of eight things.”</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Should consent to taking hold of the hand</span> means: <span class='gloss'>hand means, going up from the tip of the nail as far as the elbow. If for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she consents to taking hold below the collarbone, above the circles of the knees, there is a grave offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Or should consent to taking hold of the edge of (his) outer cloak</span> means: <span class='gloss'>if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she consents to take hold of what he is clothed in or of what he has put on, there is a grave offence.</span></p>

<p><span class='term'>Or should go to a rendezvous</span> means: <span class='gloss'>if for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she, being told by a man, ‘Come to such and such a place,’ goes (there), for every step there is an offence of wrong-doing. In merely approaching the reach of a man’s hand, there is a grave offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>Or should consent to a man’s approaching</span> means: <span class='gloss'>if <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.175' href='#BD.3.175'>BD 3.175</a> for the sake of following what is verily not the rule, she consents to a man’s approaching, there is an offence of wrong-doing.

<p><span class='term'>She also</span> means: <span class='gloss'>she is so called in reference to the former.</span></p>
<p><span class='term'>She becomes one who is defeated</span> means: <span class='gloss'>as a palmyra tree cut off at the crown cannot become one for new growth, so a nun, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.222' href='#Vin.4.222'>PTS vp Pali 4.222</a> completing the eight courses, becomes one who is not a (true) recluse, not a daughter of the Sakyans;</span> therefore she is called she becomes one who is defeated.</p>
<p><span class='term'>Not in communion</span> means: <span class='gloss'>communion …</span> is therefore called <span class='term'>not in communion</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bi-Pj.8.2.2' href='#Bi-Pj.8.2.2'>Bi-Pj.8.2.2</a> There is no offence if it is not intentional; if she is not thinking; if she does not know; if she does not consent: if she is mad, her mind unhinged, afflicted with pain, if she is the first wrong-doer.</p>
<p class='end'>Told is the Fourth Offence involving Defeat</p>
<hr>
<p>Recited, ladies, are the eight offences involving defeat; a nun having fallen into one or other of these does not receive communion together with the nuns; <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='BD.3.176' href='#BD.3.176'>BD 3.176</a> as before, so after, she becomes one who is defeated, she is not in communion. Concerning them, I ask the ladies: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a second time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? And a third time I ask: I hope that you are quite pure in this matter? The ladies are quite pure in this matter, therefore they are silent; thus do I understand this.</p>
<p class='end'>Told is the Portion on Defeat <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.223' href='#Vin.4.223'>PTS vp Pali 4.223</a> </p>
