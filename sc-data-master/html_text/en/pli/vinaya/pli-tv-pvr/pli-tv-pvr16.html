<p>“How is <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kaṭhina</i> cloth not formally made?” means: in twenty-four ways is <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kaṭhina</i> cloth not formally made. <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Kaṭhina</i> cloth is not formally made merely by marking it … (<a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-kd7/en/horner#Kd.7.1.5'>Kd.7.1.5</a>) … Thus also is <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kaṭhina</i> cloth not formally made.</p>

Temporary is called: it is called a gift that should not be appropriated. Postponement is called: there are two kinds of postponement: a postponement in carrying out (doing) and a postponement of possessions. To be forfeited is called: if the dawn breaks while it is being made. In these twenty-four ways is <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kaṭhina</i> cloth not formally made.</p>
