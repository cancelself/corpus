<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bu-Pc.54' href='#Bu-Pc.54'>Bu-Pc.54</a> … at Kosambī in Ghosita’s monastery. Now at that time the venerable Channa indulged in bad habits. The monks said:</p>
<p>“Reverend Channa, do not do that, it is not allowable.” He did the same (things) out of disrespect. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying:</p>
<p>“How can the venerable Channa do a disrespectful thing?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, Channa, did a disrespectful thing?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked him, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish man, do a disrespectful thing? It is not, foolish man, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>In disrespect there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
