<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bu-Pc.76' href='#Bu-Pc.76'>Bu-Pc.76</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time the group of six monks defamed a monk with an unfounded charge of an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can the group of six monks defame … formal meeting of the Order?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, defamed a monk with an unfounded charge of an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order?” “It is true, lord.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.148' href='#Vin.4.148'>PTS vp Pali 4.148</a> </p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying: “How can you, foolish men, defame … formal meeting of the Order? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever monk should defame a monk with an unfounded charge of an offence entailing a formal meeting of the Order, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>
