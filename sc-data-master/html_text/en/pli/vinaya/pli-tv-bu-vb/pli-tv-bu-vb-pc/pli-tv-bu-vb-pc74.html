<h1>Monks’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 74</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bu-Pc.74' href='#Bu-Pc.74'>Bu-Pc.74</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.146' href='#Vin.4.146'>PTS vp Pali 4.146</a> time the group of six monks, angry, displeased, gave the group of seventeen monks a blow; these cried out. Monks spoke thus: “Why do you, your reverences, cry out?”</p>
<p>“Your reverences, this group of six monks, angry, displeased, gave us a blow.” Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: “How can this group of six monks, angry, displeased, give monks a blow?” …</p>
<p>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, angry, displeased, gave monks a blow?”</p>
<p>“It is true, lord.”</p>
<p>The enlightened one, the lord, rebuked them, saying:</p>
<p>“How can you, foolish men, angry, displeased, give monks a blow? It is not, foolish men, for pleasing those who are not (yet) pleased … And thus, monks, this rule of training should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>Whatever monk, angry, displeased, should give a monk a blow, there is an offence of expiation.”</span></p>

If he is in doubt as to whether one is ordained … If he thinks that one is not ordained when he is ordained, (and) angry, displeased … offence of expiation.
