<h1>Monks’ Expiation (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pācittiya</i>) 91</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='Bu-Pc.91' href='#Bu-Pc.91'>Bu-Pc.91</a> … at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time a cloth for the rains was allowed to monks by the lord. The group of six monks, thinking: “A cloth for the rains is allowed by the lord,” wore cloths for the rains that were not of a (proper) measure; they went about trailing (these) along in front as well as behind. Those who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: <span class='pe'>see <a class='cr' href='/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc90/en/horner#Bu-Pc.90.1'>Bu-Pc.90.1</a></span> … “… should be set forth:</p>
<p>“<span class='rule'>When a cloth for the rains is being made for a monk, it must be made to a (proper) measure. This is the (proper) measure here: in length six spans of the accepted span, in breadth two and a half spans. In exceeding this (measure), there is an offence of expiation involving cutting down.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4.173' href='#Vin.4.173'>PTS vp Pali 4.173</a> </span></p>
