<h1>16.4. A Visitor of Families</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, what do you think, what kind of bhikkhu is worthy to be a visitor of families, and what kind of bhikkhu is not worthy to be a visitor of families?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One….”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The Blessed One said this: “Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might approach families with the thought: ‘May they give to me, not hold back! May they give me much, not a little! May they give me fine things, not shabby things! May they give me promptly, not slowly! May they give me considerately, not casually!’ When a bhikkhu approaches families with such a thought, if they do not give, he thereby becomes hurt; on that account he experiences pain and displeasure. If they give little rather than much … If they give shabby things rather than fine things … If they give slowly rather than promptly … If they give casually rather than considerately, he thereby becomes hurt; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.201' href='#sn.ii.201'>sn.ii.201</a> on that account he experiences pain and displeasure. Such a bhikkhu is not worthy to be a visitor of families.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might approach families with the thought: ‘When among others’ families, how could I possibly think: “May they give to me, not hold back!… May they give me respectfully, not casually!”?’ When a bhikkhu approaches families with such a thought, if they do not give … if they give casually rather than considerately, he does not thereby become hurt; he does not on that account experience pain and displeasure. Such a bhikkhu is worthy to be a visitor of families.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Bhikkhus, Kassapa approaches families with such a thought…. Thus if they do not give … if they give casually rather than considerately, he does not thereby become hurt; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.202' href='#sn.ii.202'>sn.ii.202</a> he does not on that account experience pain and displeasure.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Bhikkhus, I will exhort you by the example of Kassapa or one who is similar to Kassapa. Being exhorted, you should practise accordingly.”</p>
