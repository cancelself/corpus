<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Once in the past, bhikkhus, a certain devatā of the Tavatiṁsa host was revelling in Nandana Grove, supplied and endowed with the five cords of celestial sensual pleasure, accompanied by a retinue of celestial nymphs. On that occasion he spoke this verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a> “‘They do not know bliss<br>
Who have not seen Nandana,<br>
The abode of the glorious male devas<br>
Belonging to the host of Thirty.’ <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.6' href='#sn.i.6'>sn.i.6</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“When this was said, bhikkhus, a certain devatā replied to that devatā in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a> “‘Don’t you know, you fool,<br>
That maxim of the arahants?<br>
Impermanent are all formations;<br>
Their nature is to arise and vanish.<br>
Having arisen, they cease:<br>
Their appeasement is blissful.’”</p>
