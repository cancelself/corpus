Consummate, with taints destroyed,<br>
One who bears his final body,<br>
Would he still say, ‘I speak’?<br>

Consummate, with taints destroyed,<br>
One who bears his final body,<br>
He might still say, ‘I speak,’<br>
And he might say, ‘They speak to me.’<br>
Skilful, knowing the world’s parlance,<br>
He uses such terms as mere expressions.”</p>

Consummate, with taints destroyed,<br>
One who bears his final body,<br>
Is it because he has come upon conceit<br>

That he would say, ‘They speak to me’?”</p>

For him all knots of conceit are consumed.<br>
Though the wise one has transcended the conceived, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.15' href='#sn.i.15'>sn.i.15</a> <br>
