<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a> “Those of great wealth and property,<br>
Even khattiyas who rule the country,<br>
Look at each other with greedy eyes,<br>
Insatiable in sensual pleasures.<br>
72 Among these who have become so avid,<br>
Flowing along in the stream of existence,<br>
Who here have abandoned craving?<br>
Who in the world are no longer avid?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a> “Having left their homes and gone forth,<br>
Having left their dear sons and cattle,<br>
Having left behind lust and hatred,<br>
Having expunged ignorance—<br>
The arahants with taints destroyed<br>
Are those in the world no longer avid.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.16' href='#sn.i.16'>sn.i.16</a> </p>
