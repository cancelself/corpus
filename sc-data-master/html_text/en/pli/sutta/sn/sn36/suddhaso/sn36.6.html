<h1 class='sutta-title'>36.6. The Thorn</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Monks, the uneducated commoner feels pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings, and neutral feelings. Monks, an educated disciple of the noble ones also feels pleasant feelings, unpleasant feelings, and neutral feelings. Monks, in this case, what is the difference, what is the distinction, what is the variance between an educated disciple of the noble ones and an uneducated commoner?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Bhante, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, based on the Blessed One. Bhante, it would be wonderful if the Blessed One would elucidate the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Therefore, monks, listen and carefully pay attention; I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Yes, Bhante,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Monks, when an uneducated commoner is touched by a painful sensation, he sorrows, frets, and laments, beating his chest and wailing, and becomes confused. He feels two feelings – one physical and one mental. Monks, it is just like a person who has been pierced by a thorn. Then he is pierced again by a second thorn. Monks, in this way, the person feels the feeling of two thorns.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Monks, in the same way, when an uneducated commoner is touched by a painful sensation, he sorrows, frets, and laments, beating his chest and wailing, and becomes confused. He feels two feelings – physical and mental. When touched by that painful feeling, he is aversive. Since he is aversive towards that painful feeling, the tendency of aversion towards painful feelings is latent in him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“When touched by painful feelings, he seeks delight in sensual pleasure. Why is that? Monks, an uneducated commoner does not know any escape from painful feelings other than sensual pleasure. Since he seeks delights in sensual pleasure, the tendency of passion towards pleasant feelings is latent in him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“He does not accurately understand the origin, disappearance, appeal, drawback, and escape regarding those feelings. Since he does not accurately understand the origin, disappearance, appeal, drawback, and escape regarding those feelings, the tendency of ignorance towards neutral feelings is latent in him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he is trapped. If he feels a painful feeling, he is trapped. If he feels a neutral feeling, he is trapped. Monks, this is called ‘An uneducated commoner is trapped by birth, decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, depression, and anguish; he is trapped by dissatisfaction,’ I say.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Monks, when an educated disciple of the noble ones is touched by a painful sensation, he does not sorrow, fret, lament, beat his chest, wail, or become confused. He feels one feeling – physical, not mental. Monks, it is just like a person who has been pierced by a thorn. But he is not pierced again by a second thorn. Monks, in this way, the person feels the feeling of only one thorn.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“The wise one who has learned much<br>
Does not feel pleasure or pain.<br>
This is the great distinction<br>
Between a steadfast wholesome one and a commoner.</p>

Seeing clearing both this world and other worlds,<br>
Then one‘s mind is not agitated by desirable things<br>
Or aversive towards what is undesirable.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“For that one, both approval and rejection<br>
Have been vaporized, have disappeared, and do not exist.<br>
Having known the path, flawless and sorrowless,<br>
One fully understands, and transcends existence.”</p>
