<h1>36.5. Should Be Seen</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, there are these three feelings. What three? Pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Pleasant feeling, bhikkhus, should be seen as painful; painful feeling should be seen as a dart; neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling should be seen as impermanent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu has seen pleasant feeling as painful, painful feeling as a dart, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling as impermanent, he is called a bhikkhu who sees rightly. He has cut off craving, severed the fetters, and by completely breaking through conceit, he has made an end to suffering.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>One who has seen the pleasant as painful<br>
And the painful as a dart,<br>
Seen as impermanent the peaceful feeling<br>
Neither painful nor pleasant:<br>
He is a bhikkhu who sees rightly,<br>
One who fully understands feelings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Having fully understood feelings,<br>
He is taintless in this very life.<br>
Standing in Dhamma, with the body’s breakup<br>
The knowledge-master cannot be reckoned.</p>
