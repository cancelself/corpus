<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you the way that is suitable for uprooting all conceivings. Listen to that….</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the way that is suitable for uprooting all conceivings? What do you think, bhikkhus, is the eye permanent or impermanent?”—“Impermanent, venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.25' href='#sn.iv.25'>sn.iv.25</a> “Suffering, venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”—“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Are forms permanent or impermanent?… Is eye-consciousness … Is eye-contact … Is any feeling that arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—permanent or impermanent?…</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Is the ear permanent or impermanent?… Is the mind … Is any feeling that arises with mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?”—“Impermanent, venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent suffering or happiness?”—“Suffering, venerable sir.”—“Is what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’?”—“No, venerable sir.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.26' href='#sn.iv.26'>sn.iv.26</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye, towards forms, towards eye-consciousness, towards eye-contact, towards whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant. He experiences revulsion towards the ear … towards the mind … towards whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition…. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion <span class='add'>his mind</span> is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’</p>
