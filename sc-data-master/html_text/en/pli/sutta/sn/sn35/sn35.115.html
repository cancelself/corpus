<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, there are forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them, welcomes them, and remains holding to them, he is called a bhikkhu who is bound among forms cognizable by the eye, who has entered Mara’s lair, who has come under Mara’s control; <span class='add'>Mara’s snare has been fastened to him so that he is bound by the bondage of Mara</span> and the Evil One can do with him as he wishes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“There are, bhikkhus, sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu seeks delight in them … the Evil One can do with him as he wishes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“There are, bhikkhus, forms cognizable by the eye that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them, does not welcome them, and does not remain holding to them, he is called a bhikkhu who is free among forms cognizable by the eye, who has not entered Mara’s lair, who has not come under Mara’s control; <span class='add'>Mara’s snare has been unfastened from him so that he is not bound by the bondage of Mara</span> and the Evil One cannot do with him as he wishes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“There are, bhikkhus, sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that are desirable, lovely, agreeable, pleasing, sensually enticing, tantalizing. If a bhikkhu does not seek delight in them … the Evil One cannot do with him as he wishes.”</p>
