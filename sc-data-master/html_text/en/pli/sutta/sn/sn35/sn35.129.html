<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Venerable Ānanda was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Park. Then the householder Ghosita approached the Venerable Ānanda … and said to him: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.114' href='#sn.iv.114'>sn.iv.114</a> “Venerable Ānanda, it is said, ‘diversity of elements, diversity of elements.’ In what way, venerable sir, has the diversity of elements been spoken of by the Blessed One?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Householder, there exists the eye element, and forms that are agreeable, and eye-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasant, a pleasant feeling arises. There exists the eye element, and forms that are disagreeable, and eye-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as painful, a painful feeling arises. There exists the eye element, and forms that are a basis for equanimity, and eye-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, a neither- painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Householder, there exists the ear element … the nose element … the tongue element … the body element … the mind element, and mental phenomena that are agreeable, and mind-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as pleasant, a pleasant feeling arises. There exists the mind element, and mental phenomena that are disagreeable, and mind-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as painful, a painful feeling arises. There exists the mind element, and mental phenomena that are a basis for equanimity, and mind-consciousness: in dependence on a contact to be experienced as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling arises.</p>
