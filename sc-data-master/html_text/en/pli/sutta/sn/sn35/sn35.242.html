<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kimbila on the bank of the river Ganges. The Blessed One saw a great log being carried along by the current of the river Ganges, and he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Do you see, bhikkhus, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.182' href='#sn.iv.182'>sn.iv.182</a> that great log being carried along by the current of the river Ganges?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”… <span class='pe'>as above</span> …</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>When this was said, the Venerable Kimbila asked the Blessed One: “What, venerable sir, is the near shore … what is inward rottenness?”</p>
<p><span class='add'>Replies as above except the following:</span></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“And what, Kimbila, is inward rottenness? Here, Kimbila, a bhikkhu commits a certain defiled offence, an offence of a kind that does not allow for rehabilitation. This is called inward rottenness.”</p>
