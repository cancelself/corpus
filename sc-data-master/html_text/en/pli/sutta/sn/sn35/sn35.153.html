<h1>35.153. Is There a Method?</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Is there a method of exposition, bhikkhus, by means of which a bhikkhu—apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflection, apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it —<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.139' href='#sn.iv.139'>sn.iv.139</a> can declare final knowledge thus: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerable sir, our teachings are rooted in the Blessed One, guided by the Blessed One, take recourse in the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would clear up the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him, the bhikkhus will remember it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Then listen and attend closely, bhikkhus, I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“There is a method of exposition by means of which a bhikkhu—apart from faith … apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it—can declare final knowledge thus: ‘Destroyed is birth … there is no more for this state of being.’ And what is that method of exposition? Here, bhikkhus, having seen a form with the eye, if there is lust, hatred, or delusion internally, a bhikkhu understands: ‘There is lust, hatred, or delusion internally’; or, if there is no lust, hatred, or delusion internally, he understands: ‘There is no lust, hatred, or delusion internally.’ Since this is so, are these things to be understood by faith, or by personal preference, or by oral tradition, or by reasoned reflection, or by acceptance of a view after pondering it?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Aren’t these things to be understood by seeing them with wisdom?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“This, bhikkhus, is the method of exposition by means of which a bhikkhu can declare final knowledge thus: ‘Destroyed is birth … there is no more for this state of being.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Further, bhikkhus, having heard a sound with the ear … <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.140' href='#sn.iv.140'>sn.iv.140</a> … Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, if there is lust, hatred, or delusion internally, a bhikkhu understands: ‘There is lust, hatred, or delusion internally’; or, if there is no lust, hatred, or delusion internally, he understands: ‘There is no lust, hatred, or delusion internally.’ Since this is so, are these things to be understood by faith, or by personal preference, or by oral tradition, or by reasoned reflection, or by acceptance of a view after pondering it?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Aren’t these things to be understood by seeing them with wisdom?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“This, bhikkhus, is the method of exposition by means of which a bhikkhu—apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflection, apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it—can declare final knowledge thus: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
