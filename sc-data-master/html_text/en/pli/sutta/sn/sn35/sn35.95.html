<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Then the Venerable Maluṅkyaputta approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Here now, Maluṅkyaputta, what should I say to the young bhikkhus when a bhikkhu like you—old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage—asks me for an exhortation in brief?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Although, venerable sir, I am old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief, let the Fortunate One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Perhaps I may understand the meaning of the Blessed One’s statement, perhaps I may become an heir to the Blessed One’s statement.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“What do you think, Maluṅkyaputta, do you have any desire, lust, or affection for those forms cognizable by the eye that you have not seen and never saw before, that you do not see and would not think might be seen?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Do you have any desire, lust, or affection for those sounds cognizable by the ear … for those odours cognizable by the nose … for those tastes cognizable by the tongue … for those tactile objects cognizable by the body … <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.73' href='#sn.iv.73'>sn.iv.73</a> for those mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that you have not cognized and never cognized before, that you do not cognize and would not think might be cognized?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Here, Maluṅkyaputta, regarding things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized by you: in the seen there will be merely the seen; in the heard there will be merely the heard; in the sensed there will be merely the sensed; in the cognized there will be merely the cognized.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“When, Maluṅkyaputta, regarding things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized by you, in the seen there will be merely the seen, in the heard there will be merely the heard, in the sensed there will be merely the sensed, in the cognized there will be merely the cognized, then, Maluṅkyaputta, you will not be ‘by that.’ When, Maluṅkyaputta, you are not ‘by that,’ then you will not be ‘therein. ’ When, Maluṅkyaputta, you are not ‘therein,’ then you will be neither here nor beyond nor in between the two. This itself is the end of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“I understand in detail, venerable sir, the meaning of what was stated by the Blessed One in brief:</p>

He directly knew: “Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.” And the Venerable Maluṅkyaputta became one of the arahants.</p>
