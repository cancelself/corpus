<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthi. Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One … and said to him: “Venerable sir, it is said, ‘the world, the world.’ In what way, venerable sir, is it said ‘the world’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Whatever is subject to disintegration, Ānanda, is called the world in the Noble One’s Discipline. And what is subject to disintegration? The eye, Ānanda, is subject to disintegration, forms … eye-consciousness … eye-contact … whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition … that too is subject to disintegration. The ear is subject to disintegration … The mind is subject to disintegration … Whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too is subject to disintegration. Whatever is subject to disintegration, Ānanda, is called the world in the Noble One’s Discipline.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.54' href='#sn.iv.54'>sn.iv.54</a> </p>
