<h1>35.69. Upasena</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Upasena were dwelling at Rajagaha in the Cool Grove, in the</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Snake’s Hood Grotto. Now on that occasion a viper had fallen on the Venerable Upasena’s body. Then the Venerable Upasena addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Come, friends, lift this body of mine on to the bed and carry it outside before it is scattered right here like a handful of chaff.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When this was said, the Venerable Sāriputta said to the Venerable Upasena: “We do not see any alteration in the Venerable Upasena’s body nor any change in his faculties; yet the Venerable Upasena says: ‘Come, friends, lift this body of mine on to the bed and carry it outside before it is scattered right here like a handful of chaff.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Friend Sāriputta, for one who thinks, ‘I am the eye’ or ‘The eye is mine’; ‘I am the ear’ or ‘The ear is mine’ … ‘I am the mind’ or ‘The mind is mine,’ there might be alteration of the body or a change of the faculties. But, friend Sāriputta, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.41' href='#sn.iv.41'>sn.iv.41</a> it does not occur to me, ‘I am the eye’ or ‘The eye is mine’; ‘I am the ear’ or ‘The ear is mine’ … ‘I am the mind’ or ‘The mind is mine,’ so why should there be any alteration in my body or any change in my faculties?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“It must be because I-making, mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit have been thoroughly uprooted in the Venerable Upasena for a long time that it does not occur to him, ‘I am the eye’ or ‘The eye is mine’; ‘I am the ear’ or ‘The ear is mine’ … ‘I am the mind’ or ‘The mind is mine.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Then those bhikkhus lifted the Venerable Upasena’s body on to the bed and carried it outside. Then the Venerable Upasena’s body was scattered right there just like a handful of chaff.</p>
