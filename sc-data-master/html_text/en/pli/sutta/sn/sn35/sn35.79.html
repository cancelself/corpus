<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“There is one thing, bhikkhu, through the abandoning of which ignorance is abandoned by a bhikkhu and true knowledge arises.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Ignorance, bhikkhu, is that one thing through the abandoning of which ignorance is abandoned by a bhikkhu and true knowledge arises.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“But, venerable sir, how should a bhikkhu know, how should he see, for ignorance to be abandoned by him and true knowledge to arise?”</p>

When he knows and sees forms as impermanent … When he knows and sees as impermanent whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“When, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu knows and sees thus, ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises.”</p>
