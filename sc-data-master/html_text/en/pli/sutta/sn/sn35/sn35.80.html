<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“But, venerable sir, how should a bhikkhu know, how should he see, for ignorance to be abandoned by him and true knowledge to arise?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Here, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu has heard, ‘Nothing is worth adhering to.’ When a bhikkhu has heard, ‘Nothing is worth adhering to,’ he directly knows everything. Having directly known everything, he fully understands everything. Having fully understood everything, he sees all signs differently. He sees the eye differently, he sees forms differently … whatever feeling arises with mind-contact as condition … that too he sees differently.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“When, bhikkhu, a bhikkhu knows and sees thus, ignorance is abandoned by him and true knowledge arises.”</p>
