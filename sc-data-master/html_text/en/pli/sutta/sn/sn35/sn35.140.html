<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, the eye is impermanent. The cause and condition for the arising of the eye is also impermanent. As the eye has originated from what is impermanent, how could it be permanent? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.130' href='#sn.iv.130'>sn.iv.130</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“The ear is impermanent…. The mind is impermanent. The cause and condition for the arising of the mind is also impermanent. As the mind has originated from what is impermanent, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Seeing thus, bhikkhus, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards the eye … towards the mind. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion <span class='add'>his mind</span> is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It’s liberated.’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
