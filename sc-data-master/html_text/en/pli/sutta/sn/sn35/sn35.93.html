<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, consciousness comes to be in dependence on a dyad. And how, bhikkhus, does consciousness come to be in dependence on a dyad? In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness. The eye is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.68' href='#sn.iv.68'>sn.iv.68</a> forms are impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Thus this dyad is moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Eye-consciousness is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of eye-consciousness is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, eye-consciousness has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“The meeting, the encounter, the concurrence of these three things is called eye-contact. Eye-contact too is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of eye-contact is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, eye-contact has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Contacted, bhikkhus, one feels, contacted one intends, contacted one perceives. Thus these things too are moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“In dependence on the ear and sounds there arises ear-consciousness … <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.69' href='#sn.iv.69'>sn.iv.69</a> … In dependence on the mind and mental phenomena there arises mind-consciousness. The mind is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise; mental phenomena are impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. Thus this dyad is moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Mind-consciousness is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of mind-consciousness is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, mind-consciousness has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“The meeting, the encounter, the concurrence of these three things is called mind-contact. Mind-contact too is impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. The cause and condition for the arising of mind-contact is also impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise. When, bhikkhus, mind-contact has arisen in dependence on a condition that is impermanent, how could it be permanent?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Contacted, bhikkhus, one feels, contacted one intends, contacted one perceives. Thus these things too are moving and tottering, impermanent, changing, becoming otherwise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“It is in such a way, bhikkhus, that consciousness comes to be in dependence on a dyad.”</p>
