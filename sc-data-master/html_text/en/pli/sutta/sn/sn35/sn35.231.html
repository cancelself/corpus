<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, in regard to forms cognizable by the eye, if in any bhikkhu or bhikkhunī <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.160' href='#sn.iv.160'>sn.iv.160</a> lust still exists and has not been abandoned, if hatred still exists and has not been abandoned, if delusion still exists and has not been abandoned, then even trifling forms that enter into range of the eye obsess the mind, not to speak of those that are prominent. For what reason? Because lust still exists and has not been abandoned, hatred still exists and has not been abandoned, delusion still exists and has not been abandoned. The same in regard to sounds cognizable by the ear … mental phenomena cognizable by the mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a milk-sap tree —an assattha or a banyan or a pilakkha or an udumbara-fresh, young, tender. If a man breaks it here and there with a sharp axe, would sap come out?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Yes, venerable sir. For what reason? Because there is sap.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“So too, bhikkhus, in regard to forms cognizable by the eye … even trifling forms that enter into range of the eye obsess the mind, not to speak of those that are prominent. For what reason? Because lust still exists and has not been abandoned, hatred still <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.161' href='#sn.iv.161'>sn.iv.161</a> exists and has not been abandoned, delusion still exists and has not been abandoned.
