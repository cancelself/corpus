<h1>35.29. Weighed Down</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Bhikkhus, all is weighed down. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.21' href='#sn.iv.21'>sn.iv.21</a> And what, bhikkhus, is the all that is weighed down? The eye is weighed down, forms are weighed down, eye-consciousness is weighed down, eye-contact is weighed down, and whatever feeling arises with eye-contact as condition—whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant—that too is weighed down. Weighed down by what? Weighed down by birth, aging, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair, I say.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“The ear is weighed down … The mind is weighed down … Weighed down by what? Weighed down by birth … by despair, I say.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
