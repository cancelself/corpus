<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“That foolish, incompetent, unskilful cook does not pick up the sign of his own master’s preference: ‘Today this curry pleased my master, or he reached for this one, or he took a lot of this one, or he spoke in praise of this one; or the sour curry pleased my master today, or he reached for the sour one, or he took a lot of the sour one, or he spoke in praise of the sour one; or the bitter curry … or the pungent curry … or the sweet curry … or the sharp curry … or the mild curry … or the salty curry … or the bland curry pleased my master … or he spoke in praise of the bland one.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“That foolish, incompetent, unskilful cook does not gain <span class='add'>gifts of</span> clothing, wages, and bonuses. For what reason? Because that foolish, incompetent, unskilful cook does not pick up the sign of his own master’s preference.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“So too, bhikkhus, here some foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu dwells contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating the body in the body, his mind does not become concentrated, his corruptions are not abandoned, he does not pick up that sign. He dwells contemplating feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. While he dwells contemplating phenomena in phenomena, his mind does not become concentrated, his corruptions are not abandoned, he does not pick up that sign.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“That foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu does not gain pleasant dwellings in this very life, nor does he gain <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.151' href='#sn.v.151'>sn.v.151</a> mindfulness and clear comprehension. For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, that foolish, incompetent, unskilful bhikkhu does not pick up the sign of his own mind.</p>
