<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“By having developed and cultivated what things has the Venerable Anuruddha attained to greatness of direct knowledge?” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.176' href='#sn.v.176'>sn.v.176</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“It is, friend, because I have developed and cultivated the four establishments of mindfulness that I have attained to greatness of direct knowledge. What four? Here, friend, I dwell contemplating the body in the body … feelings in feelings … mind in mind … phenomena in phenomena, ardent, clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. It is, friend, because I have developed and cultivated these four establishments of mindfulness that I directly know this thousandfold world.”</p>
