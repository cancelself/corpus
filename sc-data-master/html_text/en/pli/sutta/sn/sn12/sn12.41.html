<h1>12.41. Five Fearful Animosities (1)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthī. Then the householder Anathapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Householder, when five fearful animosities have subsided in a noble disciple, and he possesses the four factors of stream-entry, and he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom the noble method, if he wishes he could by himself declare of himself: ‘I am one finished with hell, finished with the animal realm, finished with the domain of ghosts, finished with the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the nether world. I am a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as my destination.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“What are the five fearful animosities that have subsided? Householder, one who destroys life engenders, on account of such behaviour, fearful animosity pertaining to the present life and fearful animosity pertaining to the future life, and he experiences mental pain and displeasure. Thus for one who abstains from destroying life, this fearful animosity has subsided.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“One who takes what is not given … <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.69' href='#sn.ii.69'>sn.ii.69</a> … who engages in sexual misconduct … who speaks falsely … who indulges in wine, liquor, and intoxicants that are a basis for negligence engenders, on account of such behaviour, fearful animosity pertaining to the present life and fearful animosity pertaining to the future life, and he experiences mental pain and displeasure. Thus for one who abstains from wine, liquor, and intoxicants that are a basis for negligence, this fearful animosity has subsided.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“These are the five fearful animosities that have subsided.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“What are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses? Here, householder, the noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“He possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma thus: ‘The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“He possesses confirmed confidence in the Saṅgha thus: ‘The Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples is practising the good way, practising the straight way, practising the true way, practising the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.70' href='#sn.ii.70'>sn.ii.70</a> Saṅgha of the Blessed One’s disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“He possesses the virtues dear to the noble ones—unbroken, untorn, unblemished, unmottled, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“These are the four factors of stream-entry that he possesses.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“And what is the noble method that he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom? Here, householder, the noble disciple attends closely and carefully to dependent origination itself thus: ‘When this exists, that comes to be; with the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be; with the cessation of this, that ceases. That is, with ignorance as condition, volitional formations <span class='add'>come to be</span>; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“This is the noble method that he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“When, householder, these five fearful animosities have subsided in a noble disciple, and he possesses these four factors of stream-entry, and he has clearly seen and thoroughly penetrated with wisdom this noble method, if he wishes he could by himself declare of himself: ‘I am one finished with hell, finished with the animal realm, finished with the domain of ghosts, finished with the plane of misery, the bad destinations, the nether world. I am a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as my destination.’”</p>
