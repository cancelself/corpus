<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you the wrong way and the right way. Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the wrong way? With ignorance as condition, volitional formations <span class='add'>come to be</span>; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness…. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. This, bhikkhus, is called the wrong way. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.5' href='#sn.ii.5'>sn.ii.5</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“And what, bhikkhus, is the right way? With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness…. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering. This, bhikkhus, is called the right way.”</p>
