<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, I will teach you seventy-seven cases of knowledge. Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.60' href='#sn.ii.60'>sn.ii.60</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Bhikkhus, what are the seventy-seven cases of knowledge? The knowledge: ‘Aging-and-death has birth as its condition.’ The knowledge: ‘When there is no birth, there is no aging-and-death.’ The knowledge: ‘In the past too aging-and-death had birth as its condition.’ The knowledge: ‘In the past too, had there been no birth, there would have been no aging-and-death.’ The knowledge: ‘In the future too aging-and-death will have birth as its condition.’ The knowledge: ‘In the future too, should there be no birth, there will be no aging-and-death.’ The knowledge: ‘That knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma is also subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away, and cessation.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“The knowledge: ‘Birth has existence as its condition.’… The knowledge: ‘Volitional formations have ignorance as their condition. ’ The knowledge: ‘When there is no ignorance, there are no volitional formations.’ The knowledge: ‘In the past too volitional formations had ignorance as their condition.’ The knowledge: ‘In the past too, had there been no ignorance, there would have been no volitional formations.’ The knowledge: ‘In the future too volitional formations will have ignorance as their condition.’ The knowledge: ‘In the future too, should there be no ignorance, there will be no volitional formations.’ The knowledge: ‘That knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma is also subject to destruction, vanishing, fading away, and cessation.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“These, bhikkhus, are called the seventy-seven cases of knowledge.”</p>
