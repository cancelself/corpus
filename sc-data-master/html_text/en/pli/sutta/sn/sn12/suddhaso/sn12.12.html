<h1 class='sutta-title'>12.12. The Discourse to Moḷiyaphagguna</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Sāvatthi. “Monks, these are the four kinds of food<sup>1</sup>, which maintain beings that have come into existence and support those who are seeking existence. What four? Edible food, whether coarse or subtle; sense-contact is the second; mental volition is the third; consciousness is the fourth. Monks, these are the four kinds of food which maintain beings that have come into existence and support those who are seeking existence.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>When this was said, Venerable Moḷiyaphagguna said to the Blessed One, “Bhante, who feeds on consciousness-food?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“That is not a valid question,” the Blessed One said. “I do not say ‘One feeds.’ If I said, ‘One feeds,’ then this would be a valid question: ‘Bhante, who feeds on consciousness-food?’ But I do not say that. Since I do not say that, if someone asked, ‘Bhante, what is consciousness food for?’ then that would be a valid question. And the proper explanation would be, ‘Consciousness is the food based on which there is the production of further existence in the future; and when that has come to be, then there are the six senses; and based on the six senses there is sense-contact.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Bhante, who contacts?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“That is not a valid question,” the Blessed One said. “I do not say ‘One contacts.’ If I said, ‘One contacts,’ then this would be a valid question: ‘Bhante, who contacts?’ But I do not say that. Since I do not say that, if someone asked, ‘Bhante, what is the condition for sense-contact?’ then that would be a valid question. And the proper explanation would be, ‘Based on the six senses there is sense-contact, and based on sense-contact there are feelings.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Bhante, who feels?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“That is not a valid question,” the Blessed One said. “I do not say ‘One feels.’ If I said, ‘One feels,’ then this would be a valid question: ‘Bhante, who feels?’ But I do not say that. Since I do not say that, if someone asked, ‘Bhante, what is the condition for feeling?’ then that would be a valid question. And the proper explanation would be, ‘Based on sense-contact there are feelings, and based on feelings there is craving.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Bhante, who craves?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“That is not a valid question,” the Blessed One said. “I do not say ‘One craves.’ If I said, ‘One craves,’ then this would be a valid question: ‘Bhante, who craves?’ But I do not say that. Since I do not say that, if someone asked, ‘Bhante, what is the condition for craving?’ then that would be a valid question. And the proper explanation would be, ‘Based on feeling there is craving, and based on craving there is grasping.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Bhante, who grasps?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“That is not a valid question,” the Blessed One said. “I do not say ‘One grasps.’ If I said, ‘One grasps,’ then this would be a valid question: ‘Bhante, who grasps?’ But I do not say that. Since I do not say that, if someone asked, ‘Bhante, what is the condition for grasping?’ then that would be a valid question. And the proper explanation would be, ‘Based on craving there is grasping, and based on grasping there is existence.’<sup>2</sup> …this is how the entire mass of suffering arises.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“However, Phagguna, when through dispassion the six senses completely cease, then sense-contact ceases; when sense-contact ceases, feeling ceases; when feeling ceases, craving ceases; when craving ceases, grasping ceases; when grasping ceases, existence ceases; when existence ceases, birth ceases; when birth ceases, decay, dying, sorrow, lamentation, pain, depression, and anguish cease. This is how the entire mass of suffering ceases.”</p>
