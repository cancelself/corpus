<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Sāvatthī. “Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know and does not see. For one who knows what, for one who sees what, does the destruction of the taints come about? ‘Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling … such is perception … such are volitional formations … such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing away’: it is for one who knows thus, for one who sees thus, that the destruction of the taints comes about. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.30' href='#sn.ii.30'>sn.ii.30</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that the knowledge of destruction in regard to destruction has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for the knowledge of destruction? It should be said: liberation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that liberation too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for liberation? It should be said: dispassion.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that dispassion too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for dispassion? It should be said: revulsion.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that revulsion too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for revulsion? It should be said: the knowledge and vision of things as they really are.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that the knowledge and vision of things as they really are too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for the knowledge and vision of things as they really are? It should be said: concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that concentration too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for concentration? It should be said: happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that happiness too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for happiness? It should be said: tranquillity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that tranquillity too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for tranquillity? It should be said: rapture.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that rapture too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for rapture? It should be said: gladness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that gladness too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for gladness? It should be said: faith.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that faith too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.31' href='#sn.ii.31'>sn.ii.31</a> And what is the proximate cause for faith? It should be said: suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that suffering too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for suffering? It should be said: birth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that birth too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for birth? It should be said: existence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that existence too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for existence? It should be said: clinging.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that clinging too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for clinging? It should be said: craving.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that craving too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for craving? It should be said: feeling.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“For feeling, it should be said: contact. For contact: the six sense bases. For the six sense bases: name-and-form. For name-and-form: consciousness. For consciousness: volitional formations.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“I say, bhikkhus, that volitional formations too have a proximate cause; they do not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for volitional formations? It should be said: ignorance.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“Thus, bhikkhus, with ignorance as proximate cause, volitional formations <span class='add'>come to be</span>; with volitional formations as proximate cause, consciousness; with consciousness as proximate cause, name-and-form; with name-and-form as proximate cause, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as proximate cause, contact; with contact as proximate cause, feeling; with feeling as proximate cause, craving; with craving as proximate cause, clinging; with clinging as proximate cause, existence; with existence as proximate cause, birth; with birth as proximate cause, suffering; with suffering as proximate cause, faith; with faith as proximate cause, gladness; with gladness as proximate cause, rapture; with rapture as proximate cause, tranquillity; with tranquillity as proximate cause, happiness; with happiness as proximate cause, concentration; with concentration as proximate cause, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.32' href='#sn.ii.32'>sn.ii.32</a> with the knowledge and vision of things as they really are as proximate cause, revulsion; with revulsion as proximate cause, dispassion; with dispassion as proximate cause, liberation; with liberation as proximate cause, the knowledge of destruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“Just as, bhikkhus, when rain pours down in thick droplets on a mountain top, the water flows down along the slope and fills the cleft, gullies, and creeks; these being full fill up the pools; these being full fill up the lakes; these being full fill up the streams; these being full fill up the rivers; and these being full fill up the great ocean; so too, with ignorance as proximate cause, volitional formations <span class='add'>come to be</span>; with volitional formations as proximate cause, consciousness … with liberation as proximate cause, the knowledge of destruction.”</p>
