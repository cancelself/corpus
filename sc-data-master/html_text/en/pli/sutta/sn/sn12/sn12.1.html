<h1>12.1. Dependent Origination</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anathapiṇḍika’s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Bhikkhus, I will teach you dependent origination. Listen to that and attend closely, I will speak.”–“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“And what, bhikkhus, is dependent origination? With ignorance as condition, volitional formations <span class='add'>come to be</span>; with volitional formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering. This, bhikkhus, is called dependent origination.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance comes cessation of volitional formations; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.ii.2' href='#sn.ii.2'>sn.ii.2</a> with the cessation of volitional formations, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>This is what the Blessed One said. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Blessed One’s statement.</p>
