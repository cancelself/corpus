<h1>4.4. Mara’s Snare (1)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a> Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Baraṇasi in the Deer Park at Isipatana. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, I have arrived at unsurpassed liberation, I have realized unsurpassed liberation. You too, bhikkhus, by careful attention, by careful right striving, must arrive at unsurpassed liberation, must realize unsurpassed liberation.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a> “You are bound by Mara’s snare<br>
Both celestial and human;<br>
You are bound by Mara’s bondage:<br>
You won’t escape me, ascetic!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a> “I am freed from Mara’s snare<br>
Both celestial and human;<br>
I am freed from Mara’s bondage:<br>
You’re defeated, End-maker!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
