<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans at the brahmin village of Ekasala. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was teaching the Dhamma surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then it occurred to Mara the Evil One: “This ascetic Gotama is teaching the Dhamma while surrounded by a large assembly of laypeople. Let me approach the ascetic Gotama in order to confound them.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a> “This is not suitable for you,<br>
That you instruct others.<br>
When so engaged don’t get caught<br>
In attraction and repulsion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One:</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a> “Compassionate for their welfare,<br>
The Buddha instructs others.<br>
The Tathagata is fully released<br>
From attraction and repulsion.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
