<h1>4.22. Samiddhi</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Silavati . Now on that occasion the Venerable Samiddhi was dwelling not far from the Blessed One—diligent, ardent, and resolute. Then, while the Venerable Samiddhi was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in his mind thus: “It is indeed a gain for me, it is well gained by me, that my teacher is the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One! It is indeed a gain for me, it is well gained by me, that I have gone forth in this well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline! It is indeed a gain for me, it is well gained by me, that my companions in the holy life are virtuous, of good character!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then Mara the Evil One, having known with his own mind the reflection in the mind of the Venerable Samiddhi, approached him and, not far from him, made a loud noise, frightful and terrifying, as though the earth were splitting open.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then the Venerable Samiddhi approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported what had happened. <span class='speaker'>The Blessed One said:</span> “That was not the earth splitting open, Samiddhi. That was Mara the Evil One, who had come in order to confound you. Go back, Samiddhi, and dwell diligent, ardent, and resolute.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Yes, venerable sir,” the Venerable Samiddhi replied. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.120' href='#sn.i.120'>sn.i.120</a> Then he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, and departed, keeping him on the right.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>A second time, while the Venerable Samiddhi was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in his mind … And a second time Mara the Evil One … … made a loud noise, frightful and terrifying, as though the earth were splitting open.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Then the Venerable Samiddhi, having understood, “This is Mara the Evil One,” addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a> “I have gone forth out of faith<br>
From the home to the homeless life.<br>
My mindfulness and wisdom are mature,<br>
And my mind well concentrated.<br>
Conjure up whatever forms you wish,<br>
But you will never make me tremble.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, “The bhikkhu Samiddhi knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.</p>
