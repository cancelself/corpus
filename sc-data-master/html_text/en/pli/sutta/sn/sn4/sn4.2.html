<h1>4.2. The King Elephant</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvela on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the foot of the Goatherd’s Banyan Tree just after he had become fully enlightened. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.104' href='#sn.i.104'>sn.i.104</a> Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting out in the open air in the thick darkness of the night while it was drizzling.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then Mara the Evil One, wishing to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the Blessed One, manifested himself in the form of a giant king elephant and approached the Blessed One. His head was like a huge block of steatite; his tusks were like pure silver; his trunk was like a huge plough pole.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then the Blessed One, having understood, “This is Mara the Evil One,” addressed him in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a> “You’ve wandered through the long course<br>
Creating beautiful and hideous shapes.<br>
Enough, Evil One, with that trick of yours:<br>
You’re defeated, End-maker!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, “The Blessed One knows me, the Fortunate One knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.</p>
