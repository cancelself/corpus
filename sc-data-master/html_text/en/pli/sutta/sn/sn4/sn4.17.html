<h1>4.17. Six Bases for Contact</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesali in the Great Wood in the Hall with the Peaked Roof. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.113' href='#sn.i.113'>sn.i.113</a> Now on that occasion the Blessed One was instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk concerning the six bases for contact. And those bhikkhus were listening to the Dhamma with eager ears, attending to it as a matter of vital concern, applying their whole minds to it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then it occurred to Mara the Evil One: “This ascetic Gotama is instructing, exhorting, inspiring, and gladdening the bhikkhus … who are applying their whole minds to it. Let me approach the ascetic Gotama in order to confound them.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then Mara the Evil One approached the Blessed One and, not far from him, made a loud noise, frightful and terrifying, as though the earth were splitting open. Then one bhikkhu said to another: “Bhikkhu, bhikkhu! It seems as though the earth is splitting open.” When this was said, the Blessed One said to that bhikkhu: “The earth is not splitting open, bhikkhu. That is Mara the Evil One, who has come here in order to confound you.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then the Blessed One, having understood, “This is Mara the Evil One,” addressed Mara the Evil One in verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a> “Forms, sounds, tastes, odours,<br>
Tactiles, and all mental objects:<br>
This is the terrible bait of the world<br>
With which the world is infatuated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a> “But when he has transcended this,<br>
The mindful disciple of the Buddha<br>
Shines radiantly like the sun,<br>
Having surmounted Mara’s realm.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mara the Evil One … disappeared right there.</p>
