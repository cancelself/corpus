<h1>4.11. The Boulder</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting out in the open in the thick darkness of the night while it was drizzling. Then Mara the Evil One, wishing to arouse fear, trepidation, and terror in the Blessed One, shattered a number of huge boulders not far away from him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then the Blessed One, having understood, “This is Mara the Evil One,” addressed Mara the Evil One in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a> “Even if you make this Vulture Peak<br>
Quake all over in its entirety,<br>
The enlightened are not perturbed,<br>
For they are are fully liberated.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then Mara the Evil One, realizing, “The Blessed One knows me, the Fortunate One knows me,” sad and disappointed, disappeared right there.</p>
