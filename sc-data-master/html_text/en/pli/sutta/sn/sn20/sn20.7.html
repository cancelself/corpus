<h1>20.7. The Drum-Peg</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> the Exalted One was once staying near Sāvatthī at the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There the Exalted One addressed the brethren:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>Once upon a time, brethren, the Dasārahas had a kettle-drum called Summoner. As it began to split the Dasārahas fixed in ever another peg, until the time came that the Summoner's original drumhead had vanished and only the framework of pegs remained. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en179' href='#pts-vp-en179'>PTS vp En 179</a> Even so, brethren, will the brethren become in the future.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Those Suttantas uttered by the Tathāgata, deep, deep in meaning, not of the world, dealing with the void, to these when uttered, they will not listen, they will not lend a ready ear, they will not bring to them an understanding heart, they will not deem those doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, that which should be mastered. But those Suttantas which are made by poets, which are poetry, which are a manifold of words, a manifold of phrases, alien, the utterances of disciples, to these when uttered they will listen, they will lend a ready ear, they will bring an understanding heart, they will deem these doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, which should be mastered.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Thus it is, brethren, that the Suttantas uttered by the Tathāgata, deep, deep in meaning, not of the world, dealing with the void, will disappear. Wherefore, brethren, ye are thus to train yourselves: to these very Suttantas will we listen, will we give a ready ear, to these will we bring an understanding heart. And we will deem these doctrines that which should be learnt by heart, and mastered, even thus.</p>
