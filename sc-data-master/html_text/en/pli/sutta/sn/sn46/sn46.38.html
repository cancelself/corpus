The hindrance of sensual desire is not present on that occasion; the hindrance of ill will … the hindrance of sloth and torpor … the hindrance of restlessness and remorse … the hindrance of doubt is not present on that occasion. These are the five hindrances that are not present on that occasion.</p>

The enlightenment factor of mindfulness goes to fulfilment by development on that occasion…. The enlightenment factor of equanimity goes to fulfilment by development on that occasion. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.96' href='#sn.v.96'>sn.v.96</a> These are the seven factors of enlightenment that go to fulfilment by development on that occasion.</p>
