<h2>46.111. Longing</h2>
<h3>a. Full Comprehension</h3>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Monks, there are these three longings.</p>
<p>What three?</p>
<p>The longing for sensual delights, the longing for becoming, the longing for the holy life.</p>
<p>These, monks, are the three longings.</p>
<p>It is for the full comprehension of these three longings, monks, that the seven limbs of wisdom must be cultivated.</p>
<p>What seven limbs of wisdom?</p>
<p>Herein a monk cultivates the limb of wisdom that is mindfulness, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is investigation of the Norm, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>
<p>He cultivates the limb of wisdom that is energy, which is based on seclusion, on dispassion, on cessation, which ends in self-surrender.</p>

<h2>46.120. Craving</h2>
<h3>a. Full Comprehension</h3>
<p>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p>Once the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī.</p>
<p>Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“Monks, there are these three cravings.</p>
<p>What three?</p>
<p>The craving for sensual delights, the craving for becoming, the craving for ceasing to become.</p>
