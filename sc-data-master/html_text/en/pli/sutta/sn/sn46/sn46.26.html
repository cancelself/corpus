</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, develop the path and the way that leads to the destruction of craving. And what is the path and the way that leads to the destruction of craving? It is: the seven factors of enlightenment. What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness … the enlightenment factor of equanimity.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>When this was said, the Venerable Udayī asked the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how are the seven factors of enlightenment developed and cultivated so that they lead to the destruction of craving?”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“He develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release; which is vast, exalted, measureless, without ill will. When he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion … without ill will, craving is abandoned. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.87' href='#sn.v.87'>sn.v.87</a> With the abandoning of craving, kamma is abandoned. With the abandoning of kamma, suffering is abandoned.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Thus, Udayī, with the destruction of craving comes the destruction of kamma; with the destruction of kamma comes the destruction of suffering.”</p>
