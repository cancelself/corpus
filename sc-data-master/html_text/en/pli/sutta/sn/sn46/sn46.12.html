<h1>46.12. The Simile of the Sun (1)</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, this is the forerunner and precursor of the rising of the sun, that is, the dawn. So too, bhikkhus, for a bhikkhu this is the forerunner and precursor of the arising of the seven factors of enlightenment, that is, good friendship. When a bhikkhu has a good friend, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“And how does a bhikkhu who has a good friend develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release…. He develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.79' href='#sn.v.79'>sn.v.79</a> that a bhikkhu who has a good friend develops and cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment.”</p>
