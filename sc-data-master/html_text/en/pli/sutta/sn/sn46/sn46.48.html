<h1>46.48. The Sun</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, this is the forerunner and precursor of the rising of the sun, that is, the dawn. So too, for a bhikkhu this is the forerunner and precursor of the arising of the seven factors of enlightenment, that is, good friendship. When a bhikkhu has a good friend, it is to be expected that he will develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“And how does a bhikkhu who has a good friend develop and cultivate the seven factors of enlightenment? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the enlightenment factor of mindfulness … he develops the enlightenment factor of equanimity, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way that a bhikkhu who has a good friend develops and cultivates the seven factors of enlightenment.”</p>
