<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw1' href='#flw1'>FLW 1</a>Thus have I heard:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw2' href='#flw2'>FLW 2</a>Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw3' href='#flw3'>FLW 3</a>“Monks.”</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw4' href='#flw4'>FLW 4</a>“Yes, lord,” replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw5' href='#flw5'>FLW 5</a>The Exalted One said:</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw6' href='#flw6'>FLW 6</a>“By whomsoever, monks, the seven limbs of wisdom are neglected, by them is neglected this Ariyan eightfold way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw7' href='#flw7'>FLW 7</a>By whomsoever, monks, the seven limbs of wisdom are undertaken, by them is undertaken this Ariyan eightfold way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw8' href='#flw8'>FLW 8</a>What are the seven?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw9' href='#flw9'>FLW 9</a>The limb of wisdom that is mindfulness,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is Norm investigation,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is energy,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is zest,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is tranquillity,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is concentration,<br>
the limb of wisdom that is equanimity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw10' href='#flw10'>FLW 10</a>By whomsoever, monks, the seven limbs of wisdom are neglected, by them is neglected this Ariyan eightfold way for the utter destruction of ill.</p>
<p><a class='ref flw' id='flw11' href='#flw11'>FLW 11</a>By whomsoever, monks, the seven limbs of wisdom are undertaken, by them is undertaken this Ariyan eightfold way for the utter destruction of ill.”</p>
