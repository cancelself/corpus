<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Master Gotama, what is the cause and reason why sometimes even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been recited? What is the cause and reason why sometimes those hymns that have not been recited over a long period recur to the mind, let alone those that have been recited?”</p>
<p><span class='add'>i. Why the hymns do not recur to the mind</span></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Brahmin, when one dwells with a mind obsessed by sensual lust, overwhelmed by sensual lust, and one does not understand as it really is the escape from arisen sensual lust, on that occasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is one’s own good, or the good of others, or the good of both. Then even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been recited.</p>
