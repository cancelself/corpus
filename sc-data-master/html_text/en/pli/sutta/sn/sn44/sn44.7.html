<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Then the wanderer Vacchagotta approached the Venerable Mahamoggallana and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Mahamoggallana:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“How is it, Master Moggallana, is the world eternal?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The world is eternal.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Then, Master Moggallana, is the world not eternal?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The world is not eternal.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“How is it then, Master Moggallana, is the world finite?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The world is finite.’”</p>
<p>“Then, Master Moggallana, is the world infinite?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The world is infinite.’” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.392' href='#sn.iv.392'>sn.iv.392</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“How is it then, Master Moggallana, are the soul and the body the same?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The soul and the body are the same.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Then, Master Moggallana, is the soul one thing, the body another?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The soul is one thing, the body is another.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“How is it, Master Moggallana, does the Tathagata exist after death?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The Tathagata exists after death.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Then, Master Moggallana, does the Tathagata not exist after death?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The Tathagata does not exist after death.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“How is it, then, Master Moggallana, does the Tathagata both exist and not exist after death?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“Then, Master Moggallana, does the Tathagata neither exist nor not exist after death?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“Vaccha, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“What, Master Moggallana, is the cause and reason why, when wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ‘The world is eternal’ or ‘The world is not eternal’; or ‘The world is finite’ or ‘The world is infinite’; or ‘The soul and the body are the same’ or ‘The soul is one thing, the body is another’; or ‘The Tathagata exists after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata does not exist after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata both exists and does not exist after death,’ or ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death’? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.393' href='#sn.iv.393'>sn.iv.393</a> And what is the cause and reason why, when the ascetic Gotama is asked such questions, he does not give such answers?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“Vaccha, wanderers of other sects regard the eye thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ They regard the ear … the nose … the tongue … the body … the mind thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ Therefore, when the wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ‘The world is eternal’ … or ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’ But, Vaccha, the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, regards the eye thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ He regards the ear … the mind thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Therefore, when the Tathagata is asked such questions, he does not give such answers.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>Then the wanderer Vacchagotta rose from his seat and approached the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One …and said to him:</p>
<p>“How is it, good Gotama, is the world eternal?”</p>
<p><span class='add'>All as above down to:</span></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“Vaccha, I have not declared this either: ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.394' href='#sn.iv.394'>sn.iv.394</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“What, Master Gotama, is the cause and reason why, when wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ‘The world is eternal’ … or ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death’? And what is the cause and reason why, when the ascetic Gotama is asked such questions, he does not give such answers?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“Vaccha, wanderers of other sects regard the eye … the mind thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.’ Therefore, when the wanderers of other sects are asked such questions, they give such answers as: ‘The world is eternal’ … or ‘The Tathagata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’ But, Vaccha, the Tathagata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, regards the eye … the mind thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’ Therefore, when the Tathagata is asked such questions, he does not give such answers.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“It is wonderful, Master Gotama! It is amazing, Master Gotama! How the meaning and the phrasing of both teacher and disciple coincide and agree with each other and do not diverge, that is, in regard to the chief matter. Just now, Master Gotama, I approached the ascetic Moggallana <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iv.395' href='#sn.iv.395'>sn.iv.395</a> and asked him about this matter. The ascetic Moggallana explained this matter to me in exactly the same terms and phrases that Master Gotama used. It is wonderful, Master Gotama! It is amazing, Master Gotama! How the meaning and the phrasing of both teacher and disciple coincide and agree with each other and do not diverge, that is, in regard to the chief matter.”</p>
