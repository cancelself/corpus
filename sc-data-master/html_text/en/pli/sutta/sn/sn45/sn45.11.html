<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, I wish to go into seclusion for half a month. I should not be approached by anyone except the one who brings me almsfood.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied, and no one approached the Blessed One except the one who brought him almsfood.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then, when that half-month had passed, the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Bhikkhus, I have been dwelling in part of the abode in which I dwelt just after I became fully enlightened. I have understood thus: ‘There is feeling with wrong view as condition, also feeling with right view as condition…. There is feeling with wrong concentration as condition, also feeling with right concentration as condition. There is feeling with desire as condition, also feeling with thought as condition, also feeling with perception as condition.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“‘When desire has not subsided, and thought has not subsided, and perception has not subsided, there is feeling with that as condition. [When desire has subsided, and thoughts have not subsided, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.13' href='#sn.v.13'>sn.v.13</a> and perceptions have not subsided, there is also feeling with that as condition. When desire has subsided, and thoughts have subsided, and perceptions have not subsided, there is also feeling with that as condition.] When desire has subsided, and thought has subsided, and perception has subsided, there is also feeling with that as condition. There is effort for the attainment of the as-yet-unattained. When that stage has been reached, there is also feeling with that as condition.’”</p>
