<h1>45.34. Going Beyond</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, these eight things, when developed and cultivated, lead to going beyond from the near shore to the far shore. What eight? Right view … right concentration. These eight things, when developed and cultivated, lead to going beyond from the near shore to the far shore.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Few are those among humankind<br>
Who go beyond to the far shore.<br>
The rest of the people merely run<br>
Up and down along the bank.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“When the Dhamma is rightly expounded<br>
Those who practise in accord with the Dhamma<br>
Are the people who will go beyond<br>
The realm of Death so hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Having left behind the dark qualities,<br>
The wise man should develop the bright ones.<br>
Having come from home into homelessness,<br>
Where it is hard to take delight—</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“There in seclusion he should seek delight,<br>
Having left behind sensual pleasures.<br>
Owning nothing, the wise man<br>
Should cleanse himself of mental defilements.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Those whose minds are well developed<br>
In the factors of enlightenment,<br>
Who through nonclinging find delight<br>
In the relinquishment of grasping:<br>
Those luminous ones with taints destroyed<br>
Are fully quenched in the world.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.25' href='#sn.v.25'>sn.v.25</a> </p>
