<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, suppose a tree were slanting, sloping, and inclining towards the east. If it were cut at its foot, in what direction would it fall?” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.48' href='#sn.v.48'>sn.v.48</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“In whatever direction it was slanting, sloping, and inclining, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“So too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“And how does a bhikkhu do so? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops right view … right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path so that he slants, slopes, and inclines towards Nibbāna.”</p>
