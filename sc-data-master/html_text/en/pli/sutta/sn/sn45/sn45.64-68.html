<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, one thing is very helpful for the arising of the Noble Eightfold Path. What one thing? Accomplishment in virtue … Accomplishment in desire … Accomplishment in self … Accomplishment in view … Accomplishment in diligence … Accomplishment in careful attention … <span class='pe'>complete as in §63</span> <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.34' href='#sn.v.34'>sn.v.34</a> … He develops right concentration, which is based upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, maturing in release. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu who is accomplished in careful attention develops and cultivates the Noble Eightfold Path.”</p>
