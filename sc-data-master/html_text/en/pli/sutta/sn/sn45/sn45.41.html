<h1>45.41. The Fading Away of Lust</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthī. “Bhikkhus, if wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘For what purpose, friends, is the holy life lived under the ascetic Gotama?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘It is, friends, for the fading away of lust that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Then, bhikkhus, if the wanderers of other sects ask you: ‘But, friends, is there a path, is there a way for the fading away of lust?’—being asked thus, you should answer them thus: ‘There is a path, friends, there is a way for the fading away of lust.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“And what, bhikkhus, is that path, what is that way <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.28' href='#sn.v.28'>sn.v.28</a> for the fading away of lust? It is this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view … right concentration. This is the path, this is the way for the fading away of lust.</p>
