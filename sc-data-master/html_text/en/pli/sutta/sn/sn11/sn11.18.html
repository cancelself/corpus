<h1>11.18. The Worship of Householders (or Sakka’s Worship (1))</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthī. There the Blessed One said this: “Bhikkhus, once in the past Sakka, lord of the devas, addressed his charioteer Matali thus: ‘Harness the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds, friend Matali. Let us go to the park grounds to see the beautiful scenery.’—‘Yes, your lordship,’ Matali the charioteer replied. Then he harnessed the chariot with its team of a thousand thoroughbreds and announced to Sakka, lord of the devas: ‘The chariot has been harnessed, dear sir. You may come at your own convenience.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Then, bhikkhus, Sakka, lord of the devas, descending from the Vejayanta Palace, raised his joined hands in reverential salutation, and worshipped the different quarters. Then Matali the charioteer addressed Sakka in verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a> “‘These all humbly worship you—<br>
Those versed in the Triple Veda,<br>
All the khattiyas reigning on earth,<br>
The Four Great Kings and the glorious Thirty—<br>
So who, O Sakka, is that spirit<br>
To whom you bow in worship?’</p>

Those long trained in concentration,<br>

With the holy life their destination.</p>

Those householders making merit,<br>
The lay followers possessed of virtue<br>
Who righteously maintain a wife.’</p>

Are indeed the best in the world.<br>
I too will worship them—<br>
Those whom you worship, Vasava.’</p>

Having worshipped the different quarters,<br>
The deva-king Maghava, Suja’s husband,<br>
The chief, climbed into his chariot.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.i.235' href='#sn.i.235'>sn.i.235</a> </p>
