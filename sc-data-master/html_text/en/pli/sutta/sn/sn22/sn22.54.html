<h1>22.54. Seeds</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthi. “Bhikkhus, there are these five kinds of seeds. What five? Root-seeds, stem-seeds, joint-seeds, cutting-seeds, and germ-seeds as the fifth. If these five kinds of seeds are unbroken, unspoilt, undamaged by wind and sun, fertile, securely planted, but there is no earth or water, would these five kinds of seeds come to growth, increase, and expansion?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“If these five kinds of seeds are broken, spoilt, damaged by wind and sun, unfertile, not securely planted, but there is earth and water, would these five kinds of seeds come to growth, increase, and expansion?”</p>
<p>“No, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“If these five kinds of seeds are unbroken, unspoilt, undamaged by wind and sun, fertile, securely planted, and there is earth and water, would these five kinds of seeds come to growth, increase, and expansion?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Bhikkhus, the four stations of consciousness should be seen as like the earth element. Delight and lust should be seen as like the water element. Consciousness together with its nutriment should be seen as like the five kinds of seeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Consciousness, bhikkhus, while standing, might stand engaged with form; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.55' href='#sn.iii.55'>sn.iii.55</a> based upon form, established upon form, with a sprinkling of delight, it might come to growth, increase, and expansion. Or consciousness, while standing, might stand engaged with feeling … engaged with perception … engaged with volitional formations; based upon volitional formations, established upon volitional formations, with a sprinkling of delight, it might come to growth, increase, and expansion.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Bhikkhus, though someone might say: ‘Apart from form, apart from feeling, apart from perception, apart from volitional formations, I will make known the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and rebirth, its growth, increase, and expansion’—that is impossible.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Bhikkhus, if a bhikkhu has abandoned lust for the form element, with the abandoning of lust the basis is cut off: there is no support for the establishing of consciousness. If he has abandoned lust for the feeling element … for the perception element … for the volitional formations element … for the consciousness element, with the abandoning of lust the basis is cut off: there is no support for the establishing of consciousness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“When that consciousness is unestablished, not coming to growth, nongenerative, it is liberated. By being liberated, it is steady; by being steady, it is content; by being content, he is not agitated. Being unagitated, he personally attains Nibbāna. He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
