<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“And how, bhikkhus, is a bhikkhu skilled in seven cases? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.62' href='#sn.iii.62'>sn.iii.62</a> Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands form, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation; he understands the gratification, the danger, and the escape in the case of form.</p>
