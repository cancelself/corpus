Then the Venerable Rahula … said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, how should one know, how should one see so that, in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, the mind is rid of I-making, mine-making, and conceit, has transcended discrimination, and is peaceful and well liberated?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Any kind of form whatsoever, Rahula, whether past, future, or present … far or near—having seen all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ one is liberated by nonclinging.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever … Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.137' href='#sn.iii.137'>sn.iii.137</a> having seen all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ one is liberated by nonclinging.</p>
