The physical form component of attachment, the feeling component of attachment, the recognition component of attachment, the thought component of attachment, and the consciousness component of attachment. Venerable Koṭṭhita, a virtuous monk is to wisely pay attention to these five components of attachment as impermanent, unsatisfactory, disease, cancer, stabbing, misfortune, affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and impersonal. Venerable, it is possible that a virtuous monk who wisely pays attention to these five components of attachment as impermanent, unsatisfactory, disease, cancer, stabbing, misfortune, affliction, alien, disintegrating, empty, and impersonal can realize the fruit of stream-entry.”</p>
