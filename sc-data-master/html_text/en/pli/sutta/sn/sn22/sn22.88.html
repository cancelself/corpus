<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the Venerable Assaji was dwelling at Kassapaka’s Park, sick, afflicted, gravely ill.</p>
<p><span class='pe'>As in preceding sutta, down to:</span> <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.125' href='#sn.iii.125'>sn.iii.125</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Then if you have nothing for which to reproach yourself in regard to virtue, Assaji, why are you troubled by remorse and regret?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Formerly, venerable sir, when I was ill I kept on tranquillizing the bodily formations, but <span class='add'>now</span> I do not obtain concentration. As I do not obtain concentration, it occurs to me: ‘Let me not fall away!’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Those ascetics and brahmins, Assaji, who regard concentration as the essence and identify concentration with asceticism, failing to obtain concentration, might think, ‘Let us not fall away!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“What do you think, Assaji, is form permanent or impermanent?”—“Impermanent, venerable sir.”… <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.126' href='#sn.iii.126'>sn.iii.126</a> —“Therefore … Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘It is impermanent’; he understands: ‘It is not held to’; he understands: ‘It is not delighted in.’ If he feels a painful feeling, he understands: ‘It is impermanent’; he understands: ‘It is not held to’; he understands: ‘It is not delighted in.’ If he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he understands: ‘It is impermanent’; he understands: ‘It is not held to’; he understands: ‘It is not delighted in.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“If he feels a pleasant feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a painful feeling, he feels it detached; if he feels a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, he feels it detached.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“When he feels a feeling terminating with the body, he understands: ‘I feel a feeling terminating with the body.’ When he feels a feeling terminating with life, he understands: ‘I feel a feeling terminating with life.’ He understands: ‘With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Just as, Assaji, an oil lamp burns in dependence on the oil and the wick, and with the exhaustion of the oil and the wick it is extinguished through lack of fuel, so too, Assaji, when a bhikkhu feels a feeling terminating with the body … terminating with life … He understands: ‘With the breakup of the body, following the exhaustion of life, all that is felt, not being delighted in, will become cool right here.’”</p>
