<h1>22.83. Ānanda</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthi. There the Venerable Ānanda addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Friends, bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Friend!” those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Ānanda said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Friends, the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantaniputta was very helpful to us when we were newly ordained. He exhorted us with the following exhortation:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“It is by clinging, Ānanda, that <span class='add'>the notion</span> ‘I am’ occurs, not without clinging. And by clinging to what does ‘I am’ occur, not without clinging? It is by clinging to form that ‘I am’ occurs, not without clinging. It is by clinging to feeling … to perception … to volitional formations … to consciousness that ‘I am’ occurs, not without clinging.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Suppose, friend Ānanda, a young woman—or a man—youthful and fond of ornaments, would examine her own facial image in a mirror or in a bowl filled with pure, clear, clean water: she would look at it with clinging, not without clinging. So too, it is by clinging to form that ‘I am’ occurs, not without clinging. It is by clinging to feeling … to perception … to volitional formations … to consciousness that ‘I am’ occurs, not without clinging.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“What do you think, friend Ānanda, is form permanent or impermanent?”… <span class='pe'>as in preceding sutta</span> … “Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Friends, the Venerable Puṇṇa Mantaniputta <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.106' href='#sn.iii.106'>sn.iii.106</a> was very helpful to us when we were newly ordained. He exhorted us with that exhortation. And when I heard his Dhamma teaching I made the breakthrough to the Dhamma.”</p>
