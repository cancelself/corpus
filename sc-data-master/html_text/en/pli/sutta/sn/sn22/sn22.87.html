<h1>22.87. Vakkali</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rajagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Now on that occasion the Venerable Vakkali was dwelling in a potter’s shed, sick, afflicted, gravely ill. Then the Venerable Vakkali addressed his attendants:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Come, friends, approach the Blessed One, pay homage to him in my name with your head at his feet, and say: ‘Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is sick, afflicted, gravely ill; he pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at his feet.’ Then say: ‘It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would approach the bhikkhu Vakkali out of compassion.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied, and they approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and delivered their message. The Blessed One consented by silence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, approached the Venerable Vakkali. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.120' href='#sn.iii.120'>sn.iii.120</a> The Venerable Vakkali saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and stirred on his bed. The Blessed One said to him: “Enough, Vakkali, do not stir on your bed. There are these seats ready, I will sit down there.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>The Blessed One then sat down on the appointed seat and said to the Venerable Vakkali: “I hope you are bearing up, Vakkali, I hope you are getting better. I hope that your painful feelings are subsiding and not increasing, and that their subsiding, not their increase, is to be discerned.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Venerable sir, I am not bearing up, I am not getting better. Strong painful feelings are increasing in me, not subsiding, and their increase, not their subsiding, is to be discerned.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“I hope then, Vakkali, that you are not troubled by remorse and regret.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Indeed, venerable sir, I have quite a lot of remorse and regret.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“I hope, Vakkali, that you have nothing for which to reproach yourself in regard to virtue.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“I have nothing, venerable sir, for which to reproach myself in regard to virtue.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Then, Vakkali, if you have nothing for which to reproach yourself in regard to virtue, why are you troubled by remorse and regret?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“For a long time, venerable sir, I have wanted to come to see the Blessed One, but I haven’t been fit enough to do so.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Enough, Vakkali! Why do you want to see this foul body? One who sees the Dhamma sees me; one who sees me sees the Dhamma. For in seeing the Dhamma, Vakkali, one sees me; and in seeing me, one sees the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“What do you think, Vakkali, is form permanent or impermanent?”—<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.121' href='#sn.iii.121'>sn.iii.121</a> “Impermanent, venerable sir.”…—“Therefore … Seeing thus … He understands: ‘… there is no more for this state of being.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>Then the Blessed One, having given this exhortation to the Venerable Vakkali, rose from his seat and departed for Mount Vulture Peak.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, the Venerable Vakkali addressed his attendants thus: “Come, friends, lift me up on this bed and carry me to the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope. How can one like me think of dying among the houses?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied and, having lifted up the Venerable Vakkali on the bed, they carried him to the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>The Blessed One spent the rest of that day and night on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, when the night was well advanced, two devatās of stunning beauty approached the Blessed One, illuminating the whole of Mount Vulture Peak…. Standing to one side, one devatā said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is intent on deliverance.” The other devatā said: “Surely, venerable sir, he will be liberated as one well liberated.” This is what those devatās said. Having said this, they paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on their right, they disappeared right there.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Come, bhikkhus, approach the bhikkhu Vakkali and say to him: ‘Friend Vakkali, listen to the word of the Blessed One <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.122' href='#sn.iii.122'>sn.iii.122</a> and two devatās. Last night, friend, when the night was well advanced, two devatās of stunning beauty approached the Blessed One. One devatā said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is intent on deliverance.” The other devatā said: “Surely, venerable sir, he will be liberated as one well liberated.” And the Blessed One says to you, friend Vakkali: “Do not be afraid, Vakkali, do not be afraid! Your death will not be a bad one. Your demise will not be a bad one.”’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied, and they approached the Venerable Vakkali and said to him: “Friend Vakkali, listen to the word of the Blessed One and two devatās.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>Then the Venerable Vakkali addressed his attendants: “Come, friends, lower me from the bed. How can one like me think of listening to the Blessed One’s teaching while seated on a high seat.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied, and they lowered the Venerable Vakkali from the bed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“Last night, friend, two devatās of stunning beauty approached the Blessed One. One devatā said to the Blessed One: ‘Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is intent on deliverance.’ The other devatā said: ‘Surely, venerable sir, he will be liberated as one well liberated.’ And the Blessed One says to you, friend Vakkali: ‘Do not be afraid, Vakkali, do not be afraid! Your death will not be a bad one. Your demise will not be a bad one.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“Well then, friends, pay homage to the Blessed One in my name with your head at his feet and say: ‘Venerable sir, the bhikkhu Vakkali is sick, afflicted, gravely ill; he pays homage to the Blessed One with his head at his feet.’ Then say: ‘Form is impermanent: I have no perplexity about this, venerable sir, I do not doubt that whatever is impermanent is suffering. I do not doubt that in regard to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, I have no more desire, lust, or affection. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.123' href='#sn.iii.123'>sn.iii.123</a> Feeling is impermanent … Perception is impermanent … Volitional formations are impermanent … Consciousness is impermanent: I have no perplexity about this, venerable sir, I do not doubt that whatever is impermanent is suffering. I do not doubt that in regard to what is impermanent, suffering, and subject to change, I have no more desire, lust, or affection.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“Yes, friend,” those bhikkhus replied, and then they departed. Then, not long after those bhikkhus had left, the Venerable Vakkali used the knife.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>Then those bhikkhus approached the Blessed One … and delivered their message. The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Come, bhikkhus, let us go to the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope, where the clansman Vakkali has used the knife.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“Yes, venerable sir,” those bhikkhus replied. Then the Blessed One, together with a number of bhikkhus, went to the Black Rock on the Isigili Slope. The Blessed One saw in the distance the Venerable Vakkali lying on the bed with his shoulder turned. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.124' href='#sn.iii.124'>sn.iii.124</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>Now on that occasion a cloud of smoke, a swirl of darkness, was moving to the east, then to the west, to the north, to the south, upwards, downwards, and to the intermediate quarters. The Blessed One then addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Do you see, bhikkhus, that cloud of smoke, that swirl of darkness, moving to the east, then to the west, to the north, to the south, upwards, downwards, and to the intermediate quarters?”</p>
<p>“Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>“That, bhikkhus, is Mara the Evil One searching for the consciousness of the clansman Vakkali, wondering: ‘Where now has the consciousness of the clansman Vakkali been established?’ However, bhikkhus, with consciousness unestablished, the clansman Vakkali has attained final Nibbāna.”</p>
