<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At Savatthi. Then the Venerable Suradha approached the Blessed One … and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerable sir, how should one know, how should one see so that, in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, the mind is rid of I-making, mine-making, and conceit, has transcended discrimination, and is peaceful and well liberated?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Any kind of form whatsoever, Suradha, whether past, future, or present … far or near—having seen all form as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ one is liberated by nonclinging.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Any kind of feeling whatsoever … Any kind of perception whatsoever … Any kind of volitional formations whatsoever … <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.iii.81' href='#sn.iii.81'>sn.iii.81</a> Any kind of consciousness whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near—having seen all consciousness as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ one is liberated by nonclinging.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“When one knows and sees thus, Suradha, then in regard to this body with consciousness and in regard to all external signs, the mind is rid of I-making, mine-making, and conceit, has transcended discrimination, and is peaceful and well liberated.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Then the Venerable Suradha … became one of the arahants.</p>
