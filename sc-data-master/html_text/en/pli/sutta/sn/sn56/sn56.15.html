<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, do you remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.427' href='#sn.v.427'>sn.v.427</a> “Venerable sir, I remember the Four Noble Truths taught by the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“But how, bhikkhu, do you remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“I remember suffering, venerable sir, as the first noble truth taught by the Blessed One. I remember the origin of suffering as the second noble truth taught by the Blessed One. I remember the cessation of suffering as the third noble truth taught by the Blessed One. I remember the way leading to the cessation of suffering as the fourth noble truth taught by the Blessed One. It is in this way, venerable sir, that I remember the Four Noble Truths taught by the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Good, good, bhikkhu! It is good that you remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me. Suffering, bhikkhu, is the first noble truth taught by me: remember it thus. The origin of suffering is the second noble truth taught by me: remember it thus. The cessation of suffering is the third noble truth taught by me: remember it thus. The way leading to the cessation of suffering is the fourth noble truth taught by me: remember it thus. In this way, bhikkhu, remember the Four Noble Truths taught by me.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Therefore, bhikkhu, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
