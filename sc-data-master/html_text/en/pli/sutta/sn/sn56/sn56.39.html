<h1>56.39. Indra’s Pillar</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who really knows, who really sees.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, a tuft of cotton wool or kapok, light, wafted by the wind, had settled on an even piece of ground. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.444' href='#sn.v.444'>sn.v.444</a> An easterly wind would drive it westward; a westerly wind would drive it eastward; a northerly wind would drive it southward; a southerly wind would drive it northward. For what reason? Because of the lightness of the tuft.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“So too, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who do not understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who really knows, who really sees.’ For what reason? Because they have not seen the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“But, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they do not look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who really knows, who really sees.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Suppose, bhikkhus, there was an iron pillar or an Indra’s pillar with a deep base, securely planted, immobile, unshaking. Even if a forceful blast of wind comes—whether from the east, the west, the north, or the south—that pillar would not shake, quake, or tremble. For what reason? Because the pillar has a deep base and is securely planted.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“So too, bhikkhus, those ascetics or brahmins who understand as it really is ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’—they do not look up at the face of another ascetic or brahmin, thinking: ‘This worthy is surely one who really knows, who really sees.’ For what reason? Because, bhikkhus, they have clearly seen the Four Noble Truths. What four? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.445' href='#sn.v.445'>sn.v.445</a> The noble truth of suffering … the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
