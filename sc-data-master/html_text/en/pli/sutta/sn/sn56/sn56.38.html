<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, so long as the sun and moon have not arisen in the world, for just so long there is no manifestation of great light and radiance, but then blinding darkness prevails, a dense mass of darkness; for just so long day and night are not discerned, the month and fortnight are not discerned, the seasons and the year are not discerned.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“But, bhikkhus, when the sun and moon arise in the world, then there is the manifestation of great light and radiance; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.443' href='#sn.v.443'>sn.v.443</a> then there is no blinding darkness, no dense mass of darkness; then day and night are discerned, the month and fortnight are discerned, the seasons and year are discerned.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“So too, bhikkhus, so long as a Tathagata has not arisen in the world, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One, for just so long there is no manifestation of great light and radiance, but then blinding darkness prevails, a dense mass of darkness; for just so long there is no explaining, teaching, proclaiming, establishing, disclosing, analysing, or elucidating of the Four Noble Truths.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“But, bhikkhus, when a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One, then there is the manifestation of great light and radiance; then no blinding darkness prevails, no dense mass of darkness; then there is the explaining, teaching, proclaiming, establishing, disclosing, analysing, and elucidating of the Four Noble Truths. What four? The noble truth of suffering … the noble truth of the way leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
