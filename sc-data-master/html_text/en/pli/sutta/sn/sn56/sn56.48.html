<h1>56.48. Yoke with a Hole (2)</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, suppose that this great earth had become one mass of water, and a man would throw a yoke with a single hole upon it. An easterly wind would drive it westward; a westerly wind would drive it eastward; a northerly wind would drive it southward; a southerly wind would drive it northward. There was a blind turtle which would come to the surface once every hundred years. What do you think, bhikkhus, would that blind turtle, coming to the surface once every hundred years, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='sn.v.457' href='#sn.v.457'>sn.v.457</a> insert its neck into that yoke with a single hole?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“It would be by chance, venerable sir, that that blind turtle, coming to the surface once every hundred years, would insert its neck into that yoke with a single hole.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“So too, bhikkhus, it is by chance that one obtains the human state; by chance that a Tathagata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One arises in the world; by chance that the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata shines in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“You have obtained that human state, bhikkhus; a Tathagata, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One has arisen in the world; the Dhamma and Discipline proclaimed by the Tathagata shines in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Therefore, bhikkhus, an exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’”</p>
