<h1>32. The Āṭānāṭiya Discourse</h1>
</header>
<h2>The Occasion</h2>
<p><span class='evam'>Thus I have heard</span>: at one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha on the Vultures’ Peak Mountain. Then the Four Great Kings, with a great army of yakkhas, with a great army of gandhabbas, with a great army of kumbhaṇḍas, with a great army of nāgas, having set up a protection over the four quarters, having set serried troops at the four directions, having set up a barricade at the four directions, at the end of the night, having lit up the whole of Vultures’ Peak with their surpassing beauty, approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. Then of those yakkhas, some, after worshipping the Gracious One, sat down on one side. Some exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, sat down on one side. Some, after raising their hands in respectful salutation to the Gracious One, sat down on one side. Some, after announcing their name and family, sat down on one side. Some, while keeping silent, sat down on one side. Then, while sitting on one side, the Great King Vessavaṇa said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p>“There are, reverend Sir, some high ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some high ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some middle ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some middle ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some low ranking yakkhas who are not pleased with the Gracious One, there are, reverend Sir, some low ranking yakkhas who are pleased with the Gracious One. But, reverend Sir, almost all of the yakkhas are not pleased with the Gracious One.</p>
<p>“What is the reason for that? Because, reverend Sir, the Gracious One preaches the Dhamma of refraining from killing living creatures, preaches the Dhamma of refraining from taking what has not been given, preaches the Dhamma of refraining from sexual misconduct, preaches the Dhamma of refraining from false speech, preaches the Dhamma of refraining from liquor, wines, or intoxicants which cause heedlessness. But, reverend Sir, almost all of the yakkhas do not refrain from killing living creatures, do not refrain from taking what has not been given, do not refrain from sexual misconduct, do not refrain from false speech, do not refrain from liquors, wines, or intoxicants which cause heedlessness. To them that is neither dear nor appealing.</p>
<p>“There are, reverend Sir, disciples of the Gracious One in the wilderness, who are practising in remote jungle dwelling places, where there is little sound, little noise, which have a lonely atmosphere, lying hidden away from men, which are suitable for seclusion. And there are high ranking yakkhas settled there who are not pleased with the word of the Gracious One. To please them, reverend Sir, may the Gracious One learn this Āṭānāṭiya protection, for the monks’, nuns’, laymen’s, and laywomen’s guard, protection, freedom from harm, and comfortable living.”</p>
<p>The Gracious One by keeping silent gave consent. Then the Great King Vessavaṇa having understood the Gracious One’s consent on that occasion recited this Āṭānāṭiya protection:</p>

Then some yakkhas rose from their seats and after worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, vanished right there.

<p class='endsection'>The first recital is finished.</p>

Then of those yakkhas, monks, some, after worshipping me, sat down on one side. Some exchanged greetings with me, and after exchanging polite and courteous greetings, sat down on one side. Some, after raising their hands in respectful salutation to me, sat down on one side. Some, after announcing their name and family, sat down on one side.
