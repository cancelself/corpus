<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>Then the Gracious One addressed the Magadhan chief minister the brahmin Vassakāra, <span class='add'>saying</span>: “At one time, brahmin, I was living near Vesālī near to the Sārandada Shrine and there I taught the Vajjians these seven things which prevent decline.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc244' href='#sc244'>SC 244</a>Then venerable Ānanda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side. While sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc245' href='#sc245'>SC 245</a>“I have seen, reverend Sir, the Gracious One comfortable, I have seen, reverend Sir, the Gracious One bearing up <span class='add'>while sick</span>, and my body, reverend Sir, became faint as it were, and although I could not see <span class='add'>straight</span>, and things were not clear, it appeared to me, reverend Sir, that the Gracious One was sick, <span class='add'>but</span> it was some small comfort that the Gracious One would not attain Final Emancipation until the Gracious One had spoken regarding the Community of monks.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc246' href='#sc246'>SC 246</a>“But what, Ānanda, does the Community of monks expect of me? The Teaching has been taught by me, Ānanda, without having made <span class='add'>a distinction between</span> esoteric and exoteric, for the Realised One there is nothing, Ānanda, of a <span class='add'>closed</span> teacher’s fist in regard to the Teaching.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc247' href='#sc247'>SC 247</a>To whoever, Ānanda, this <span class='add'>thought</span> occurs: ‘I will lead the Community of monks’ or ‘I am the instructor of the Community of monks’ let him speak, Ānanda, regarding the Community of monks. But to the Realised One, Ānanda, this <span class='add'>thought</span> does not occur: ‘I will lead the Community of monks’ or ‘I am the instructor of the Community of monks’. Then why, Ānanda, should the Realised One speak regarding the Community of monks?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc248' href='#sc248'>SC 248</a>I, Ānanda, at present, am old, elderly, of great age, far gone, advanced in years, I am eighty years old. It is like, Ānanda, an old cart, which <span class='add'>only</span> keeps going when shored up with bamboo, just so, Ānanda, I think the Realised One’s body <span class='add'>only</span> keeps going when shored up with bamboo.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc249' href='#sc249'>SC 249</a>When the Realised One doesn’t pay attention, Ānanda, to any of the signs, when all feelings have ceased, he lives having established the signless mind-concentration, and at that time, Ānanda, the Realised One’s body is most comfortable.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc250' href='#sc250'>SC 250</a>Therefore, Ānanda, live with yourself as an island, yourself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge. And how, Ānanda, does a monk live with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc251' href='#sc251'>SC 251</a>Here, Ānanda, a monk dwells contemplating <span class='add'>the nature of</span> the body in the body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class='add'>the nature of</span> feelings in feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class='add'>the nature of</span> the mind in the mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world; he dwells contemplating <span class='add'>the nature of</span> things in <span class='add'>various</span> things, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, after removing avarice and sorrow regarding the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc252' href='#sc252'>SC 252</a>Thus, Ānanda, a monk lives with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge. For whoever, Ānanda, whether at present or after my passing, lives with himself as an island, himself as a refuge, with no other refuge, with the Teaching as an island, the Teaching as a refuge, with no other refuge, those monks of mine, Ānanda, will go from darkness to the highest—whoever likes the training.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc253' href='#sc253'>SC 253</a>Then the Gracious One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms.

What was the reason, what was the cause, for the occurrence of this great earthquake?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc287' href='#sc287'>SC 287</a>Then venerable Ānanda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down at one side. Sitting on one side venerable Ānanda said this to the Gracious One: “Surely it is wonderful, reverend Sir, surely it is marvellous, reverend Sir, this great earthquake, this very great earthquake, and <span class='add'>this</span> awful, hair-raising, crash of the Divinities’ <span class='add'>thunder</span> drum. What was the reason, reverend Sir, what was the cause, for the occurrence of this great earthquake?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc288' href='#sc288'>SC 288</a>“There are these eight reasons, eight causes, Ānanda, for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p>Which eight?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc289' href='#sc289'>SC 289</a>1) This great Earth, Ānanda, stands in the water, the water stands in the atmosphere, the atmosphere stands in space. There comes a time, Ānanda, when great winds blow, with the great winds blowing, the waters move, the waters having moved, the Earth moves. This is the first reason, the first cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc290' href='#sc290'>SC 290</a>2) Furthermore, Ānanda, when an ascetic or a brahmin or a Divinity, one of great power, one of great majesty, has, through spiritual power, attained <span class='add'>complete</span> mastery of the mind, and has then developed even a trifling perception of the Earth, or an unlimited perception of water, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the second reason, the second cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc291' href='#sc291'>SC 291</a>3) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Buddha-to-be falls away from the Tusita hosts, and mindfully, with full awareness, enters his mother’s womb, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the third reason, the third cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc292' href='#sc292'>SC 292</a>4) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Buddha-to-be mindfully, with full awareness, exits his mother’s womb, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the fourth reason, the fourth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc293' href='#sc293'>SC 293</a>5) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One perfectly awakens to the unsurpassed and Perfect Awakening, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the fifth reason, the fifth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc294' href='#sc294'>SC 294</a>6) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One sets the unsurpassed wheel of the Teaching rolling, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the sixth reason, the sixth cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc295' href='#sc295'>SC 295</a>7) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One mindfully, with full awareness gives up the life-process, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes. This is the seventh reason, the seventh cause for the occurrence of a great earthquake.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc296' href='#sc296'>SC 296</a>8) Furthermore, Ānanda, when the Realised One is Finally Emancipated in the Emancipation-element which has no basis for attachment remaining, this Earth moves, wavers, flutters, and shakes.

<h3 class='add'>37: Kusinārā’s History</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc541' href='#sc541'>SC 541</a>After this was said, venerable Ānanda addressed the Gracious One, <span class='add'>saying</span>: “Reverend Sir, may the Gracious One not attain Final Emancipation in this small town, this barren town, this branch town. There are, reverend Sir, other great towns, such as: Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, Bārāṇasī—let the Gracious One attain Final Emancipation there. There are many wealthy Nobles there, wealthy brahmins, wealthy householders, who are devoted to the Realised One, and will worshipfully <span class='add'>dispose of</span> the Realised One’s body.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc542' href='#sc542'>SC 542</a>“Do not say that, Ānanda, do not say that, Ānanda: ‘<span class='add'>This</span> small town, this barren town, this branch town’. Formerly, Ānanda, there was a King by the name of Mahāsudassana, a Righteous Monarch, a Righteous King, who was victorious over the four quarters, one who had established a stable country, endowed with the seven jewels.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc543' href='#sc543'>SC 543</a>This Kusinārā, was then named Kusāvatī, and was King Mahāsudassana’s capital city. Stretching for twelve leagues from East to West, and seven leagues from North to South, the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous, Ānanda, successful, populous, full of people, with much food, just as, Ānanda, the capital city of the Divinities named Āḷakamandā is prosperous, successful, populous, full of people, with much food, so the capital city Kusāvatī was prosperous, Ānanda, successful, populous, full of people, with much food.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc544' href='#sc544'>SC 544</a>The capital city Kusāvatī was never separated from the ten sounds, by day or by night, that is to say: the sound of elephants, the sound of horses, the sound of chariots, the sound of drums, the sound of tabours, the sound of lutes, the sound of songs, the sound of cymbals, the sound of hand bells, <span class='add'>and with</span> ‘eat, drink, chew!’ as the tenth sound.</p>
<h3 class='add'>38: The Mallas Worship the Gracious One</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc545' href='#sc545'>SC 545</a>“Go, Ānanda, and after entering into Kusinārā, announce to the Mallas: ‘Today, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, do not regret it afterwards <span class='add'>thinking</span>: “In the area of our village, was the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation, and we did not, in the last watch of the night, get to see the Realised One”’.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc546' href='#sc546'>SC 546</a>“Very well, reverend Sir,” said venerable Ānanda, and after replying to the Gracious One, dressing, and taking his robes and bowl, he entered Kusinārā with a companion.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc547' href='#sc547'>SC 547</a>Now at that time the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall having some business or other. Then venerable Ānanda went to where the Mallas from Kusinārā were assembled in the Council Hall, and after approaching he said this to the Mallas: “Today, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, come along, Vāseṭṭhas, do not regret it afterwards <span class='add'>thinking</span>: ‘In the area of our village, was the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation, and we did not, in the last watch of the night, get to see the Realised One.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc548' href='#sc548'>SC 548</a>After hearing this from venerable Ānanda, the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas became miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering. Some, having dishevelled hair, were weeping, throwing up their arms, falling down <span class='add'>as though</span> cut down, rolling backwards and forwards as though with their feet cut off, they were crying: “Too quickly the Gracious One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Fortunate One will attain Final Emancipation, too quickly the Visionary in the world will disappear!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc549' href='#sc549'>SC 549</a>Then the Mallas, the sons of the Mallas, the daughters-in-law of the Mallas, and the wives of the Mallas, miserable, depressed, with their minds given over to suffering, approached the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana, and approached venerable Ānanda.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc550' href='#sc550'>SC 550</a>Then this occurred to venerable Ānanda: “If I make the Mallas of Kusinārā worship the Gracious One one by one before the Gracious One has been worshipped by the Mallas of Kusinārā the night will end. Now what if I, having segregated the Mallas family by family, made them worship the Gracious One, <span class='add'>saying</span>: ‘A Malla named so and so, together with his children, wife, dependents, and councillors worships the Gracious One’s feet with his head’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc551' href='#sc551'>SC 551</a>Then venerable Ānanda having segregated the Mallas family by family, made them worship the Gracious One, <span class='add'>saying</span>: “A Malla named so and so, together with his children, wife, dependents, and councillors worships the Gracious One’s feet with his head.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc552' href='#sc552'>SC 552</a>Then venerable Ānanda, in this way, during the first watch of the night, made the Mallas of Kusinārā worship the Gracious One.</p>
<h3 class='add'>39: Subhadda, the Last Direct Disciple</h3>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc553' href='#sc553'>SC 553</a>Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda had arrived at Kusinārā. The wanderer Subhadda heard: “Today, it seems, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc554' href='#sc554'>SC 554</a>Then this occurred to the wanderer Subhadda: “I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said: ‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’ Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation. There is a doubt that has arisen for me, and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus: ‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc555' href='#sc555'>SC 555</a>Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Mallas’ Sal Wood at Upavattana, and approached venerable Ānanda, and after approaching he said to venerable Ānanda: “I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda, who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said: ‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’ Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the ascetic Gotama’s attainment of Final Emancipation. There is a doubt that has arisen for me, and I have confidence in the ascetic Gotama thus: ‘The ascetic Gotama is able to teach the Teaching in such a way that I will be able to abandon that doubt’. It would be well, dear Ānanda, if I was allowed to see the ascetic Gotama.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc556' href='#sc556'>SC 556</a>After this was said, venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: “Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Gracious One is exhausted.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc557' href='#sc557'>SC 557</a>For a second time the wanderer Subhadda said this to venerable Ānanda: “I have heard this from old, elderly wanderers, dear Ānanda, who are teachers and teachers’ teachers, when they said: ‘Only occasionally, rarely, do Realised Ones, Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas arise in the world.’ Today, in the last watch of the night, will be the Realised One’s attainment of Final Emancipation.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc560' href='#sc560'>SC 560</a>For a third time venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: “Enough, friend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realised One, the Gracious One is exhausted.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc561' href='#sc561'>SC 561</a>The Gracious One heard venerable Ānanda having this conversation with the wanderer Subhadda. Then the Gracious One said this to venerable Ānanda: “Enough, Ānanda, do not obstruct Subhadda allow Subhadda to see the Realised One. Whatever Subhadda will ask of me all of it he will ask of me seeking for deep knowledge, and not to trouble me. Whatever question is put I will answer, and he will quickly understand it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc562' href='#sc562'>SC 562</a>Then venerable Ānanda said this to the wanderer Subhadda: “Go, friend Subhadda, the Gracious One has given you permission.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc563' href='#sc563'>SC 563</a>Then the wanderer Subhadda approached the Gracious One, and after approaching, he exchanged greetings with the Gracious One, and after exchanging courteous talk and greetings, he sat down on one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc564' href='#sc564'>SC 564</a>While sitting on one side the wanderer Subhadda said this to the Gracious One: “Those ascetics and brahmins, dear Gotama, who have a community, a group, who teach a group, well-known, famous, religious founders, agreed upon as good for the people, such as: Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhaputta, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, have they all understood, according to their own avowal?

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc651' href='#sc651'>SC 651</a>“Let us do according to the Divinities’ intention, reverend Sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc652' href='#sc652'>SC 652</a>Then venerable Mahākassapa approached Kusinārā, and the Mallas’ Shrine called the Bonded Coronet, and the Gracious One’s funeral pyre, and after approaching and arranging his robe on one shoulder, extending <span class='add'>his hands</span> in respectful salutation, and circumambulating the funeral pyre three times, and uncovering the feet he worshipped the Gracious One’s feet with his head.</p>
