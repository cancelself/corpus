<h1>1.17 Kesakari’s Mansion</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='speaker'>Devata:</span></p>
<p>My mansion is very beautiful and shines in all directions. The pillars of the mansion are made of beryl gemstones. Golden trees decorate the surrounding garden. This mansion appeared as a result of my meritorious deeds.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>God Sakka:</span></p>
<p>One hundred thousand goddesses were born before you here in this mansion to be your attendants. Now you enjoy their company and their service. The light of the full moon shines and surpasses the stars in brightness. The same goes for you: you shine brilliantly and surpass all the other goddesses. Your appearance is extraordinary.</p>
<p>All the gods in Tavatimsa Heaven, headed by me, are overcome with the desire to stare at the great Brahma and admire him. They cannot help but stare at him. So too, is your appearance. All the gods stare at you and admire you. Please tell me where you have come from. In which world did you live in before you were born here?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Devata:</span></p>
<p>God Sakka, I will tell you everything. In the human world, there is a city called Baranasi in the state of Kasi. I was a woman in that city and my name was Kesakarika. I had great confidence in the Supreme Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Noble Sangha. My faith in the Triple Gem was unshakable. All my doubts were removed. I kept the Five Precepts very purely and I attained the fruit of stream entry. As a result, I am surely headed to the realization of Nibbana.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>God Sakka:</span></p>
<p>Excellent! You have great confidence in the Supreme Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Noble Sangha. Your faith in the Triple Gem is unshakable. All your doubts are removed. You lived under the Five Precepts very purely and you have attained the fruit of stream entry. As a result, you are surely heading to the realization of Nibbana.</p>
<p>Devata, you shine due to your Dhamma practice and your retinue of goddesses. You are greatly welcomed here in this world. We rejoice in your arrival here.</p>
