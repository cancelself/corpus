<p><span class='speaker'>Moggallana Bhante:</span></p>
<p>Devata, your beauty shines in all directions like the bright star named Osadhi.</p>
<p>What are the meritorious deeds that led to this happiness?</p>
<p>Devata, the pure radiance of your body and limbs is stainless and shines in all directions.</p>
<p>Tell me Devata, what kind of meritorious action did you do when you were in the human world to have gained this beauty that shines in all directions, and to have earned all these wonderful things?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Narrator:</span></p>
<p>That devata, delighted at being questioned by Arahant Moggallana, gladly explained what she had done that resulted in such great happiness.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Devata:</span></p>
<p>In my previous life, I was a woman in the human world. One day I saw the Supreme Buddha who was free from defilements and had a peaceful mind. I knew very well that the Buddha was worthy of gifts and therefore my mind had confidence in him. I was a little worried because I did not have valuable things to offer. But still, I offered some sesame seeds with my own hands.</p>
<p>Because of this meritorious deed, I have been born as a very beautiful devata and enjoy all the wonderful things that delight my heart.</p>
<p>Great Bhante, that is the meritorious action I did to have such a beautiful body that shines in all directions.</p>
