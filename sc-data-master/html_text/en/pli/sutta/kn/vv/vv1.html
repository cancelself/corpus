<h1>1.1 Throne Mansion</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='speaker'>Moggallana Bhante:</span></p>
<p>Dear Devata, you are sitting on a golden throne. It flies wherever you want, and as quickly as you want it to. You are beautifully dressed, wearing garlands of flowers, and you are radiant, like lightning shining through the clouds.</p>
<p>What kind of meritorious action did you do when you were in the human world to have gained this beauty that shines in all directions, and to have earned all these wonderful things?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Narrator:</span></p>
<p>That devata, delighted at being questioned by Arahant Moggallana, gladly explained what she had done that resulted in such great happiness.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Devata:</span></p>
<p>Bhante, when I was in the human world, a monk visited our house and I prepared a chair for him to sit on. Raising my hands and putting my palms and fingers together, I saluted that monk respectfully. I also offered almsfood to him.</p>
<p>Because of these meritorious deeds, I have been born as a very beautiful devata and enjoy all the wonderful things that delight my heart.</p>
<p>Great Bhante, these are the meritorious deeds I did to have such a beautiful body that shines in all directions.</p>
