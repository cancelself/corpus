<p><span class='speaker'>Kumara Kassapa Bhante:</span></p>
<p>Dear Deva, there is a beautiful divine hall owned by the god Sakka called Sudhamma Assembly Hall. All the Devas gather there harmoniously. Shining brilliantly in the sky, your mansion is as beautiful as that assembly hall.</p>
<p>Powerful Deva, you have become a leader among devas. The pure radiance of your body and limbs is stainless and shines in all directions.</p>
<p>Tell me, what kind of meritorious action did you do when you were in the human world to have gained this beauty that shines in all directions, and to have earned all these wonderful things?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Narrator:</span></p>
<p>That deva, delighted at being questioned by Arahant Kumara Kassapa gladly explained what he had done that resulted in such great happiness.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Deva:</span></p>
<p>Bhante, in my previous life I lived in the human world as a young servant of King Payasi. I received some money and offered alms using that money. Virtuous monks are very dear to me. I had confidence in them. I offered much food and drink to them respectfully.</p>
<p>Because of this meritorious deed, I have been born as a very beautiful deva and enjoy all the wonderful things that delight my heart.</p>
<p>Great Bhante, that is the meritorious action I did to have such a beautiful body that shines in all directions.</p>
