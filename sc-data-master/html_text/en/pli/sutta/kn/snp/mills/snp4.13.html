<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns902' href='#vns902'>SC Verse 902</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
Regarding those people who hold to their views,<br>
Arguing, “Only this is true!”<br>
Should all of them be criticized,<br>
Or are some praiseworthy also?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns903' href='#vns903'>SC Verse 903</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
This is a small thing, not enough for peace.<br>
I say there are two outcomes of dispute;<br>
Seeing this one should not dispute,<br>
Recognizing that safety is a place without dispute.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns904' href='#vns904'>SC Verse 904</a>Regarding these widely-held opinions,<br>
One who knows does not get involved with any of them.<br>
Why would the uninvolved become involved,<br>
Since they have no preferences<br>
In what is seen or heard?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns905' href='#vns905'>SC Verse 905</a>Those who consider ethics to be the highest<br>
Say that purity comes from self-restraint.<br>
They undertake a vow and stick to it,<br>
Thinking that only training in this way is there purity,<br>
Declaring themselves experts,<br>
They go to future rebirths.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns906' href='#vns906'>SC Verse 906</a>If he falls away from virtuous conduct and vows,<br>
He is anxious, having failed in his task.<br>
He yearns and longs for purity, as one far from home<br>
Who has lost his travelling companions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns907' href='#vns907'>SC Verse 907</a>But one who abandons all virtue and vows,<br>
and deeds both blameless and blameworthy,<br>
Does not long for either purity or impurity;<br>
he lives detached, fostering peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns908' href='#vns908'>SC Verse 908</a>Dependent on ascetic practices,<br>
Or on what is seen, heard, or thought,<br>
They say that purity comes from continual transmigration,<br>
They are not free of craving for life after life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns909' href='#vns909'>SC Verse 909</a>One who yearns has longings,<br>
And is anxious regarding their aspirations;<br>
But for one here who has no falling away or reappearing,<br>
Why would they be anxious,<br>
Or for what would they long?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns910' href='#vns910'>SC Verse 910</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
The doctrine that some people call the ultimate,<br>
Others say is deficient.<br>
Which of these speaks the truth?<br>
For all of them say they are experts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns911' href='#vns911'>SC Verse 911</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
They say their own doctrine is complete,<br>
While that of others is deficient.<br>
Thus arguing they dispute,<br>
Each taking what they agree upon to be the truth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns912' href='#vns912'>SC Verse 912</a>If by criticizing an opponent<br>
Their doctrine became deficient,<br>
There would be no distinguished doctrines,<br>
Because it is common for people to speak<br>
In defence of their own doctrines,<br>
While making the other’s out to be deficient.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns913' href='#vns913'>SC Verse 913</a>Indeed, the honoring of their own teachings<br>
Is nothing other than praise of themselves;<br>
If each doctrine were valid,<br>
Then purity would be just a personal matter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns914' href='#vns914'>SC Verse 914</a>The brahmin is not led by another,<br>
Considering wisely, they do not grasp any teaching;<br>
Therefore they go beyond disputes,<br>
Since they see no other doctrine as best.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns915' href='#vns915'>SC Verse 915</a>Thinking, “I know, I see, this is how it is!”<br>
Some fall back on view as purity.<br>
Even if one has seen, what use is that to them?<br>
Overstepping, they say purity<br>
Comes by some other means.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns916' href='#vns916'>SC Verse 916</a>A person with vision sees mind and body,<br>
And then knows only that much;<br>
Let them see much or little,<br>
The experts say purity does not come from that.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns917' href='#vns917'>SC Verse 917</a>One who speaks dogmatically,<br>
Who’s settled down in view,<br>
Will not be deferent, one not easily trained.<br>
To that attached, his own views “pure”,<br>
“pure path” according to what he’s seen.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns918' href='#vns918'>SC Verse 918</a>The paragon with wisdom comes not near<br>
To following views, by partial knowledge bound.<br>
Having known opinions of common people,<br>
He’s equanimous, though others study them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns919' href='#vns919'>SC Verse 919</a>The sage lets go of all ties to the world,<br>
And when disputes come up they do not take sides;<br>
Peaceful amid the agitated, they are equanimous,<br>
They don’t hold on, thinking, “Let them hold on”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns920' href='#vns920'>SC Verse 920</a>Former corruptions are abandoned,<br>
While new ones are not created,<br>
They have no biases, and are not dogmatic.<br>
The sage is freed from commitment to views,<br>
Not clinging to the world, nor reproaching themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns921' href='#vns921'>SC Verse 921</a>They have no enemies in the doctrines,<br>
Whether seen, heard, or thought;<br>
The sage is freed, having put down the burden,<br>
Not planning, not wanting, not wishing.</p>
