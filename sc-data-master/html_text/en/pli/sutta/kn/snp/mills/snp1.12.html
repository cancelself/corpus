of strict practices—their living-ways not the same:<br>
house-livers not restrained from taking others’ lives,<br>
but the sage always guards other beings’ lives.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns223' href='#vns223'>SC Verse 223</a>In flight the crested peacock, turquoise-necked,<br>
never the swiftness of the swan attains,<br>
so a house-liver cannot match a bhikkhu,<br>
a sage meditating in the woods.</p>
