Now I’ll tell of the Leaving Home,<br>
how he, the mighty seer, went forth,<br>
how he was questioned and described<br>
the reason for his Leaving Home.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns409' href='#vns409'>SC Verse 409</a>The crowded life lived in a house<br>
exhales an atmosphere of dust:<br>
but leaving home is open wide—<br>
seeing this, he chose Leaving Home.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns410' href='#vns410'>SC Verse 410</a>By doing so did he reject<br>
all bodily evil acts,<br>
rejected too, wrong ways of speech,<br>
his livelihood he purified.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns411' href='#vns411'>SC Verse 411</a>He went to Rājagaha town,<br>
hill-guarded fort of Magadhans;<br>
there he, the Buddha, walked for alms,<br>

in all his marks,</p>

“Look, sirs”, he said,<br>
How stately is that man, handsome,<br>
how pure, how perfect is his gait;<br>
with eyes downcast, mindful, he looks<br>
only a plough-yoke’s length ahead.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns414' href='#vns414'>SC Verse 414</a>He’s surely not of humble birth!<br>

upon the path the bhikkhu takes.”</p>

The messengers were sent at once<br>
and followed closely in his wake:<br>
“Now which way will the bhikkhu go?<br>
Where has he chosen his abode?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns416' href='#vns416'>SC Verse 416</a>He wanders on from house to house<br>
guarding sense-doors with real restraint.<br>
Fully aware and mindfully,<br>

The bhikkhu, sire, is like a lion,<br>
or like a tiger, like a bull<br>
and seated in a mountain-cave<br>
on the eastern slope of Paṇḍava!</p>

The Warrior hears the runner’s tale,<br>
then summoning up a coach of state,<br>
he drove in haste from out the town,<br>
out to the hill of Paṇḍava.</p>

and then descended from the coach;<br>
the little distance that remained,<br>
he went on foot, drew near the Sage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns422' href='#vns422'>SC Verse 422</a>The King sat down, and he exchanged<br>
greetings, and asked about his health.<br>
When this exchange of courtesy was done,<br>
the king then spoke to him these words:</p>

You are indeed quite young,<br>
a youth, a man in life’s first phase,<br>
you have the good looks of a man<br>
of high-born warrior-noble stock,</p>

Straight over there, O king,<br>

in that, the clan of Sakyas.<br>
From that family I’ve left home<br>
not desiring pleasures of sense.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns427' href='#vns427'>SC Verse 427</a>Having seen dangers in sense-desires,<br>
renunciation seen as secure,<br>
I shall go on to strive<br>
for there does my mind delight</p>
