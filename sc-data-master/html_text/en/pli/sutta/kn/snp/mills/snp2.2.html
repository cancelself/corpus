they who speak no lies desiring sensual pleasures.</p>

of Sālī-rice, all other things to eat,<br>
delicious, by others donated specially<br>
that one, O Kassapa, is like a carrion-stench.</p>

while eating <i>sālī</i>-rice, all other things<br>
with flesh of fowls so very well prepared;<br>
the meaning of this, O Kassapa, I ask:<br>
Your food, what sort of carrion-stench it has?</p>

Taking life, torture, mutilation too,<br>
binding, stealing, telling lies, and fraud;<br>
deceit, adultery, and studying crooked views:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>

those void of compassion, extremely arrogant,<br>
the miserly, to others never giving anything:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>

imposters, slanderers, deceitful in their dealings,<br>
vile men who commit evil deeds in this world:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>

they go to darkness after death;<br>
such beings as this fall headlong into Hell:<br>
this is carrion-stench, not the eating of meat.</p>

not by the plucking of head-hairs,<br>
nor growing of matted locks,<br>
not by the smearing of the ashes of the dead,<br>
not wearing abrasive skins,<br>
not following sacrificial fires,<br>
or worldly austerities for gaining immortality,<br>
nor mantras, nor offerings,<br>
oblations, seasons’ services<br>
can purify a mortal still overcome by doubt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns253' href='#vns253'>SC Verse 253</a>Who lives with sense-streams guarded, well-aware,<br>
in the Dharma firm, enjoying gently rectitude,<br>
beyond attachments gone, all <i>dukkha</i> left behind,<br>
that wise one’s unsullied by the seen and the heard.</p>

Again, again the Radiant One this topic taught<br>
to that knower of the Vedas, in those mantras expert,<br>
thus clarified the Sage in verses sweetly-sounding.<br>
Him of no carrion-stench, free who’s hard to trace.</p>

free of such stench, all <i>dukkhas</i> dispelling,<br>
he of humble heart bowed at the Tathāgata’s feet<br>
and there and then requested his own Leaving-home.</p>
