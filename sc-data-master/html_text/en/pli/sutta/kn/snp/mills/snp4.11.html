<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns869' href='#vns869'>SC Verse 869</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
Whence so many arguments, disputes<br>
and sorrow, lamentation, selfishness,<br>
arrogance, pride and slander too?<br>
Whence come all these? Please upon them speak.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns870' href='#vns870'>SC Verse 870</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Much love of arguments, disputes,<br>
means sorrow, lamentation, selfishness,<br>
with arrogance, pride and slander too.<br>
Inclined to selfishness, arguments, disputes;<br>
quarrels, slander also come to birth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns871' href='#vns871'>SC Verse 871</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
From what causes in the world there’s dearness, love,<br>
these various greeds that wander in the world,<br>
from these causes, hopes and their ends as well,<br>
these bring about a human being’s future.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns872' href='#vns872'>SC Verse 872</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
From desires in the world as causes of the dear,<br>
these various greeds that wander in the world,<br>
from these causes, hopes and their ends as well,<br>
these bring about a human being’s future.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns873' href='#vns873'>SC Verse 873</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
From what causes in the world is there desire,<br>
and much deliberation on this—whence it comes?<br>
And anger too, false-speaking, also doubtfulness,<br>
and dharmas such as these by the <i>Samaṇa</i> declared</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns874' href='#vns874'>SC Verse 874</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
“It’s pleasant, unpleasant”, so in the world they say<br>
and depending on these arises desire,<br>
but having seen forms, their arising and decay,<br>
then a person in this world certainly deliberates.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns875' href='#vns875'>SC Verse 875</a>With anger, false-speaking, also doubtfulness,<br>
and all such dharmas, this quality exists.<br>
The doubting person<br>
in the knowledge-path should train<br>
for the <i>Samaṇa</i> has declared dharmas<br>
after having Known.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns876' href='#vns876'>SC Verse 876</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
The pleasant, the unpleasant, originate from what?<br>
In the absence of what do these cease to be?<br>
That which is being, non-being as well,<br>
what their origination, do tell me of this?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns877' href='#vns877'>SC Verse 877</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
“Touch”, the origination of pleasant, unpleasant,<br>
“Touch” being absent these cease to be.<br>
That which is being, non-being as well,<br>
its origin’s thus, I tell you of this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns878' href='#vns878'>SC Verse 878</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
From what causes in the world does touch come to be<br>
And whence does possessiveness also arise?<br>
in the absence of what is “mine” making not?<br>
When what exists not are no “touches” touched?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns879' href='#vns879'>SC Verse 879</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
“Touches” depend upon mind, upon form,<br>
possessiveness caused by longing repeated,<br>
when longing’s not found, possessiveness’s gone,<br>
When form is no longer, no “touches” are “touched”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns880' href='#vns880'>SC Verse 880</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
For one in what state does form cease to be,<br>
how bliss and <i>dukkha</i> come to cease as well,<br>
please do you tell me how these come to cease?<br>
For this we would know—such is my intent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns881' href='#vns881'>SC Verse 881</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Neither one of normal perception nor yet abnormal,<br>
neither unperceiving no cessation of perception,<br>
but form ceases for one who (has known) it thus:<br>
Conceptual proliferation has perception as its cause.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns882' href='#vns882'>SC Verse 882</a><span class='speaker'>Question</span><br>
Whatever we’ve asked of you, to us you’ve explained,<br>
another query we’d ask, please speak upon this,<br>
those reckoned as wise here, do they say that<br>
“purity of soul is just for this (life)”<br>
or do some of them state there’s another beyond?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns883' href='#vns883'>SC Verse 883</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Here some reckoned as wise do certainly say:<br>
“Purity of soul is just for this life”;<br>
but others who claim to be clever aver<br>
that there is an occasion<br>
for what has nothing leftover.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns884' href='#vns884'>SC Verse 884</a>And Knowing that these are dependent on views,<br>
having Known their dependence, the investigative Sage<br>
since Liberated Knows, so no longer disputes,<br>
the wise one goes not from being to being.</p>
