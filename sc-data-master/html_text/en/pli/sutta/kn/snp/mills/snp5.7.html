<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1076' href='#vns1076'>SC Verse 1076</a><span class='speaker'>Upasīva</span><br>
Alone, O Sakya, unsupported too,<br>
the mighty flood I do not dare to cross,<br>
All-seeing One, please tell me of the means<br>
using which I may overpass the flood.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1077' href='#vns1077'>SC Verse 1077</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Mindfully do you no-thingness regard,<br>
rely on “there-is-not” to go across the flood,<br>
abandon conversation, let go of sense-desires,<br>
See craving’s exhaustion by night and by day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1078' href='#vns1078'>SC Verse 1078</a><span class='speaker'>Upasīva</span><br>
That one who’s unattached to sense-desires,<br>
relying on no-thingness, left others aside,<br>
freed in the highest of consciousness’s freedom,<br>
will that one be established, or fall away from this?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1079' href='#vns1079'>SC Verse 1079</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
That one who’s unattached to sense-desires,<br>
relying on no-thingness, left others aside,<br>
freed in the highest of consciousness’s freedom,<br>
that one will be established, not fall away from this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1080' href='#vns1080'>SC Verse 1080</a><span class='speaker'>Upasīva</span><br>
Should that one remain even for a heap of years,<br>
O all-Seeing One, but still not fall away?<br>
Would that one liberated cool-become just there,<br>
consciousness ceased in that very state?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1081' href='#vns1081'>SC Verse 1081</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
As flame blown out by force of wind<br>
has gone to its “goal”, cannot be described,<br>
likewise the Sage “in mind and body” freed:<br>
gone to the Goal and cannot be described.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1082' href='#vns1082'>SC Verse 1082</a><span class='speaker'>Upasīva</span><br>
Does one not exist who’s reached the Goal?<br>
Or does one dwell forever free?<br>
O Sage, do well declare this to me now,<br>
for certainly this dharma’s known by you.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1083' href='#vns1083'>SC Verse 1083</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Of one who’s reached the Goal, no measure’s found,<br>
there is not that by which one could be named,<br>
when dharmas for that one are emptied out,<br>
emptied are the ways of telling too.</p>
