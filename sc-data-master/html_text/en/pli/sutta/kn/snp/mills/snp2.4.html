<h1>The Greatest Good Fortune</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>This is what I have heard</span>. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. On that occasion, as the night was coming to an end, a certain god of great beauty approached the Blessed One while illuminating the whole Jeta Grove. After bowing to the Blessed One, they stood to one side and spoke a verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>

Desiring well-being,<br>
Are seekers of good fortune:<br>
Please tell me the greatest good fortune.”</p>
