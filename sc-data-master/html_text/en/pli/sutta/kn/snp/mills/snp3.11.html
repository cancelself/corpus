In midday meditation the sage Asita saw<br>
brilliantly arrayed the thrice-ten deva troop,<br>
happy and joyful waving flags the while,<br>
with Sakka their superior all highly elated.<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns686' href='#vns686'>SC Verse 686</a>Then when he had seen the devas so delighted<br>
respectfully he greeted them and questioned them like this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Why is this deva-Saṅgha so exceedingly joyful<br>
they’ve brought along banners for brandishing about?<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns687' href='#vns687'>SC Verse 687</a>Even when the devas battled anti-gods<br>
with a win for deva-hosts, and loss for demon-hordes,<br>
then was no such celebration— so what have devas seen?<br>
What wonder have they heard? Why devas are delighted?<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns688' href='#vns688'>SC Verse 688</a>They whistle and they sing, clap hands and strum sitars;<br>
with dancing and with music, so they celebrate.<br>
O you deva-dwellers on Meru’s airy peaks,<br>
I beg you, good sirs, soon dispel my doubts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns689' href='#vns689'>SC Verse 689</a><span class='speaker'>Devas</span><br>
A Bodhisattva has been born in the Sakyans’ city,<br>
in lands along Lumbini. Precious gem beyond compare,<br>
for the weal and welfare of those in the human realm.<br>
That’s why we’re delighted and completely overjoyed.<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns690' href='#vns690'>SC Verse 690</a>He, best being of all, foremost among mankind,<br>
mighty bull among men, of creatures all supreme,<br>
will revolve the wheel in ancient seers’ woods,<br>
likened to a roaring lion, mightiest of beasts.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns691' href='#vns691'>SC Verse 691</a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Having known this news, then the sage in haste<br>
in mind descended to Suddhodana’s abode,<br>
sat he down and said:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><span class='speaker'>Asita</span> Where then is this prince? I wish to see him now!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns692' href='#vns692'>SC Verse 692</a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
So Sakyans he beseeched.<br>
Then to him Asita named did Sakyans show their son,<br>
the prince in colour clear as rays from shining gold,<br>
burnished and illustrious both of supernal hue.<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns693' href='#vns693'>SC Verse 693</a>Joy with rapture great filled Asita’s heart<br>
on perceiving this young prince, bright as crested flame,<br>
pure like the lunar lord stars herding through the sky,<br>
dazzling as the sun on cloudless autumn days.<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns694' href='#vns694'>SC Verse 694</a>Sky beings all above carried canopy of state<br>
of many-tiered parasols as well as gold-handled whisks—<br>
but no one saw the bearers of the whisks and parasols.<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns695' href='#vns695'>SC Verse 695</a>The sage with dreadlocked hair, also Kaṇhasiri called,<br>
seeing then the prince— golden jewel upon brocade,<br>
white parasols of state held above his head—<br>
received him in his arms with gladdened mind and joy.<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns696' href='#vns696'>SC Verse 696</a>As soon as he received the foremost Sakyan man,<br>
he, skilled in lore of signs and mastery of mantras,<br>
exclaimed:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><span class='speaker'>Asita</span><br>
Highest, unexcelled among the race of men!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns697' href='#vns697'>SC Verse 697</a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
But recollected then that soon, so soon, he’d die.<br>
Seeing the sobbing prince, the Sakyans asked of him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><span class='speaker'>Sakyans</span><br>
Surely for this prince no peril will befall?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns698' href='#vns698'>SC Verse 698</a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
The sage in answer said to anxious Sakyan’s throng:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><span class='speaker'>Asita</span><br>
“No fears do I foresee to come upon the prince,<br>
nor any harm at all in future will befall,<br>
nor he’s unfortunate, so do not be depressed,<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns699' href='#vns699'>SC Verse 699</a>for he will touch upon Enlightenment divine<br>
and turn the Dharma wheel. Seer of perfect purity,<br>
with compassion for the many, he will set forth the goodly life.<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns700' href='#vns700'>SC Verse 700</a>But I’ve only brief time left within my life,<br>
while in this time I’ll die, having no chance to hear<br>
the Dharma of that one of power incomparable;<br>
this saddens me so, such loss distresses me.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns701' href='#vns701'>SC Verse 701</a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Having roused in Sakyans this joy profound, the sage,<br>
keeper of pure precepts, left inner palace suites.<br>
Then of his compassion to his sister’s son set out,<br>
arousing in him interest in the Dharma deep:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns702' href='#vns702'>SC Verse 702</a><span class='speaker'>Asita</span><br>
From persons having heard the sound of “Buddha” word<br>
who Sambodhi attained, practising the Dharma-path,<br>
go there, then question him, as his disciples live with him.<br>
Practice with that radiant lord precepts of purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns703' href='#vns703'>SC Verse 703</a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
So, instructed by him, whose mind set on benefit,<br>
who foresaw in future time perfect purity complete,<br>
that Nālaka, his nephew much merit stored away,<br>
with guarded senses waited in expectation of the victor.<br>
<a class='ref vns' id='vns704' href='#vns704'>SC Verse 704</a>Having heard of the victor’s revolution of the noble wheel,<br>
he went to him and saw him, that prime among the saviours,<br>
and trust arose in him in the greatest sage.<br>
Then he enquired upon the Silentness supreme,<br>
thus coming to fulfil the sages wish.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns705' href='#vns705'>SC Verse 705</a><span class='speaker'>Nālaka</span><br>
Having understood Asita’s speech—<br>
that it accords with truthfulness,<br>
Gotama, we question you<br>
on dharmas gone to the further shore.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns706' href='#vns706'>SC Verse 706</a>I came to homelessness but now I wish<br>

Knowledge of Silence I’ll convey,<br>
hard to do, to master difficult,<br>
so be both firm and resolute<br>
and I’ll speak upon this thing.</p>
