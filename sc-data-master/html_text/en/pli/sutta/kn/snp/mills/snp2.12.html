<h1>2.12. Vaṅgīsa’s Questions, Buddha’s Answer</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At one time the Lord dwelt at Āḷāvī, at the Aggāḷava Shrine. Not long before, the venerable Vaṅgīsa’s preceptor, by name the elder Nigrodhakappa, had become completely Cool at the Aggāḷava Shrine. Then in Vaṅgīsa’s mind, being at one and in solitude, arose this thought: “Has my preceptor become completely Cool or has he not?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Later in the day Vaṅgīsa left his solitude and went to the Lord and having drawn near him, paid his respects and sat to one side. While sitting there Vaṅgīsa said this to the Lord: “While I was sitting in meditation this thought arose in my mind: ‘Has my preceptor become completely Cool or has he not?’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Vaṅgīsa then arose from his seat, placed his upper robe over one shoulder and, lotussing his hands respectfully, addressed the Lord with these verses.</p>

We ask now the Teacher of wisdom supreme—<br>
who’s cut off all doubts in this very life,<br>
that Aggāḷava bhikkhu who died recently,<br>
famous, well-known, was he truly Cool-become?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns347' href='#vns347'>SC Verse 347</a>His name Nigrodhakappa was,<br>
to that brahmin given by the Radiant One,<br>
he went around revering you, and, strenuous<br>
seeking Liberation, O Seer of the Secure.</p>

concerning this hearkener, Kappa by name,<br>
all of our ears are ready to hear—<br>
the Teacher you are, the One unsurpassed.</p>

that he knew complete Cool, O Wisdom Profound:<br>
tell this in our midst, O All-Seeing One,<br>
as thousand-eyed Sakka by devas ringed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns350' href='#vns350'>SC Verse 350</a>Whatever here deluded paths bring on the bondages,<br>
on ignorance’s side, the bases for all doubts,<br>
on reaching the Tathāgata they cease to be,<br>
for certainly his Eye is supreme among men.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns351' href='#vns351'>SC Verse 351</a>If never, no one, could defilements disperse,<br>
as forceful wind a piled-up mass of clouds,<br>
enshrouded would be, for sure, the whole world,<br>
and even the illustrious would have no chance to shine.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns352' href='#vns352'>SC Verse 352</a>But the Wise in this world are the makers of light<br>

as swan (its neck) stretches sounding softly forth;<br>
with your melodious voice so well-modulated<br>
to it we listen, all of us, attentively.</p>

I’ll urge the One who’s Cleansed to Dharma teach;<br>
ordinary persons cannot act out their desires,<br>

Rain down on our ears!</p>

the life of purity—surely it wasn’t in vain;<br>
did he become Cool or did residues remain—<br>

Craving he cut for mind and body both—<br>
craving’s stream that long had lain within him;<br>
completely he has crossed beyond all birth and death—<br>
So the Blessed One spoke, the Fore before the Five.</p>

Hearing your word, O Seventh of Seers,<br>
I’m both pleased and truly satisfied.<br>
Truly my question’s not in vain—<br>
that brahmin did elude me not!</p>
