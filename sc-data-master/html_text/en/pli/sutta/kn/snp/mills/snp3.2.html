As I strove to subdue myself<br>
beside the broad Nerañjarā,<br>
absorbed unflinchingly to gain<br>
the surcease of bondage here,<br>
Namucī came and spoke to me<br>
with words all garbed in pity thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns429' href='#vns429'>SC Verse 429</a><span class='speaker'>Māra</span><br>
O you are thin and you are pale,<br>
and you are in death’s presence too:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns430' href='#vns430'>SC Verse 430</a>a thousand parts are pledged to death<br>
but life still holds one part of you.<br>
Live, sir! Life’s the better way;<br>
you may gain merit if you live,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns431' href='#vns431'>SC Verse 431</a>come live the life of purity, pour<br>
libations on the holy fires<br>
and thus a world of merit gain.<br>
What can you do by struggling now?</p>

and difficult and hard to bear.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><span class='speaker'>Narrator</span><br>
Now Māra, as he spoke these lines<br>
drew near until he stood close by.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns433' href='#vns433'>SC Verse 433</a>The Blessed One replied to him<br>
as he stood thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
O Evil One,<br>
O Cousin of the Negligent,<br>
you have come here for your own ends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns434' href='#vns434'>SC Verse 434</a>Now, merit I need not at all.<br>
Let Māra talk of merit then,<br>
to those that stand in need of it.</p>

and I have understanding, too.<br>
So while I thus subdue myself,<br>
why do you speak to me of life?</p>

even the rivers’ running streams;<br>
so while I thus subdue myself,<br>
why should it not dry up my blood?</p>

and phlegm run dry, the wasting flesh<br>
becalms the mind: I shall have more<br>
of mindfulness and wisdom too,<br>
I shall have greater concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns438' href='#vns438'>SC Verse 438</a>For living thus I come to know<br>
the limits to which feeling goes.<br>
My mind looks not to sense-desires:<br>
Now see a being’s purity.</p>

None but the brave will conquer them<br>
to gain bliss by the victory.</p>

proclaiming no retreat: shame upon life<br>
defeated here—better to die in battle now<br>
than choose to live on in defeat.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns444' href='#vns444'>SC Verse 444</a>Ascetics and brahmins there are found<br>

arrayed all round, with elephants,<br>
I sally forth to fight, that I<br>
may not be driven from my post.</p>

Though step by step for seven years<br>
I’ve followed on the Blessed One,<br>
the Fully Enlightened One, possessed<br>

And is there something tasty here?”</p>
