<p><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At one time the Lord dwelt at Āḷavī in the haunt of the <i>yakkha</i> Āḷavaka. Then the latter went to the Lord’s dwelling and spoke to him as follows: “Monk, come out!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Very well, friend” said the Buddha (and came out).</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monk, go in!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Very well, friend” said the Buddha and entered his dwelling. He repeated these demands twice, but on the fourth demand the Buddha said:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“I shall not come out to you, friend, do what you will.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Monk, I shall ask you a question and if you cannot answer it I shall either overthrow your mind, split your heart, or seizing you by the feet, throw you to the other side of the Ganges river.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“I do not see, friend, anyone in the world with its devas, Māras and Brahmās, in this generation with its monks and brahmins, princes and men who can either overthrow my mind, or split my heart, or seize me by the feet and throw me to the other side of the Ganges river. However, friend, ask what you will.”</p>
