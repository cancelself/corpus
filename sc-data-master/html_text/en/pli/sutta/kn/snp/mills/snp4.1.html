<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns773' href='#vns773'>SC Verse 773</a>If one with a desiring mind<br>
Succeeds in gaining sensual pleasure,<br>
A mortal such is pleased in mind<br>
With wishes all fulfilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns774' href='#vns774'>SC Verse 774</a>But if from this person passionate<br>
all of these pleasures disappear,<br>
then does this pleasure-addict feel,<br>
as though by arrows pierced.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns775' href='#vns775'>SC Verse 775</a>The one who shuns these pleasures of sense,<br>
like treading not on a serpent’s head,<br>
such a one with mindfulness<br>
this tangled world transcends.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns776' href='#vns776'>SC Verse 776</a>Obsessed with fields and property,<br>
with money, estates and those employed,<br>
with many pleasures, women and kin,<br>
such a person greedily—</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns777' href='#vns777'>SC Verse 777</a>Do weaknesses bring down indeed,<br>
by dangers is that person crushed,<br>
and then by <i>dukkhas</i> stuck against—<br>
as water into broken boat.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns778' href='#vns778'>SC Verse 778</a>So let a mindful one avoid<br>
at every turn these sense-desires,<br>
with them abandoned, cross the flood,<br>
as boat is baled for the Further Shore.</p>
