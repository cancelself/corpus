<h1>1.7. Who is the Outcaste?</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At one time the Radiant One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then in the morning the Radiant One dressed and, taking bowl and robes, entered Sāvatthī for almsfood. At that time the sacrificial fire was burning in the house of the brahmin Aggika-Bhāradvāja and the offering was held aloft. Then the Radiant One walking in almsround, house by house within Sāvatthī, came to the house of brahmin Aggika-Bhāradvāja. The brahmin saw the Radiant One coming from a distance and called out this to him: “Stop there, mere shaveling, stop there, vile ascetic, stop there, foul outcaste!” When this was said, the Radiant One said to the brahmin: “Do you know, brahmin, what an outcaste is or what things make a person ‘outcaste’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“I do not know good Gotama what an outcaste is or what things make one an outcaste. It would be good for me if the venerable Gotama were to teach me Dharma, so that I might know an outcaste and what things make an outcaste.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Then listen, brahmin, pay attention and I shall tell you.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Yes, venerable sir”, replied the brahmin.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>When this was said, the brahmin Aggika-bhāradvāja exclaimed to the Radiant One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by the Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was righting what was overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes can see forms. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma and to the Saṅgha. May Master Gotama remember me as an <i>upāsaka</i> who from today has Gone for Refuge for life.”</p>
