<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns811' href='#vns811'>SC Verse 811</a>Short indeed is this life—<br>
within a hundred years one dies,<br>
and, if any live longer<br>
then they die of decay.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns812' href='#vns812'>SC Verse 812</a>People grieve for what is “mine”:<br>
though possessions are not permanent<br>
and subject to destruction—<br>
see this and homeless dwell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns813' href='#vns813'>SC Verse 813</a>In death it’s all abandoned,<br>
yet still some think “it’s mine”;<br>
knowing this, the wise to me devoted<br>
should stoop not making it “owned”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns814' href='#vns814'>SC Verse 814</a>As one who’s waking then sees not<br>
the things that happened in sleep;<br>
so the beloved are not seen—<br>
departed and done their time.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns815' href='#vns815'>SC Verse 815</a>People now are seen and heard<br>
and these are called by name,<br>
but alone will the name remain<br>
in speaking of those gone.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns816' href='#vns816'>SC Verse 816</a>In “mine-making” greedy, they do not let go<br>
of sorrow, lamenting and avarice,<br>
therefore sages leaving possessions<br>
freely wander, seers of security.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns817' href='#vns817'>SC Verse 817</a>For a bhikkhu practicing in solitude,<br>
keeping company with secluded mind,<br>
of such a one are all agreed:<br>
“In being he’ll not be seen again”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns818' href='#vns818'>SC Verse 818</a>In all matters the sage is unsupported,<br>
nothing that makes dear, nor undear,<br>
sorrow and avarice do not stain that one,<br>
As water does not stay upon a leaf.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns819' href='#vns819'>SC Verse 819</a>As a water-drop on lotus plant,<br>
as water does not stain a lotus flower,<br>
even so the sage is never stained<br>
by seen, heard, or whatever’s cognized.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns820' href='#vns820'>SC Verse 820</a>Certainly the wise do not conceive<br>
upon the seen, the heard, and cognized,<br>
nor wish for purity through another,<br>
for they are not attached nor yet displeased.</p>
