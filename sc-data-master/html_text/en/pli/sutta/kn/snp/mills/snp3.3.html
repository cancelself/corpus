<h1>3.3. The Well-spoken</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At one time the Radiant One dwelt at Sāvatthī, in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. The Radiant One spoke thus: “Bhikkhus”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Venerable Sir”, those bhikkhus replied.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Speech having four qualities is well-spoken, not ill-spoken, and blameless, not blameworthy, among the wise. What four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu speaks only what is well-spoken, not what is ill-spoken; what is Dharma, not what is not-Dharma; what is kindly, not what is unkind; what is the truth, not what is false. This speech is well-spoken, not ill-spoken, and blameless, not blameworthy among the wise.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>This is what the Radiant One said, then he spoke further.</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns453' href='#vns453'>SC Verse 453</a>Now peaceful Ones say: first speak the well-spoken,<br>
and second, speak Dharma but not its opposite,<br>
what’s kind do speak, third, not the unkind,<br>
while fourth, speak the truth but never the false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Then the venerable Vaṅgīsa rose with robe over one shoulder and lotussed hands towards the Radiant One saying to him: “Sir, it has come to me!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Let it come to you, Vaṅgīsa.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>The venerable Vaṅgīsa then praised the Radiant One in his presence with these appropriate verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns454' href='#vns454'>SC Verse 454</a>Only that speech should be spoken<br>
from which harm does not come to oneself,<br>
nor torment brings upon others—<br>
this truly is speech that’s well-spoken.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns455' href='#vns455'>SC Verse 455</a>Speak only those words that are kind,<br>
the speech that is gladly received,<br>
so whatever one speaks to others,<br>
conveying no evil, is kind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns456' href='#vns456'>SC Verse 456</a>Truth indeed, is deathless speech—<br>
this is the ancient Dharma.<br>
On truth, its study and practice both,<br>
they say are the Peaceful firm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns457' href='#vns457'>SC Verse 457</a>Whatever words the Buddha speaks,<br>
<i>Nirvāṇa</i>’s safety to attain,<br>
bringing <i>dukkha</i> to an end,<br>
such words they are the worthiest.</p>
