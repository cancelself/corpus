The Sakyan I’ve requested twice<br>
but the Seer has not replied;<br>
I have heard tell that questioned thrice,<br>
a Sage divine explains.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1124' href='#vns1124'>SC Verse 1124</a>I do not understand the view<br>
of the renowned Gotama<br>
upon this world, the other world,<br>
on Brahma’s realm, the deva’s world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1125' href='#vns1125'>SC Verse 1125</a>So to the One of vision supreme,<br>
with this query have I come:<br>
how should one regard the world<br>
that the Death-king sees one not?</p>

Be ever mindful, Mogharāja,<br>
and as empty, view the world,<br>
with view of self pulled up,<br>
and thus crossed over death—<br>
who sees the world like this<br>
the King of Death sees not.</p>
