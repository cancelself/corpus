Who has contentment in the world?<br>
Who is not agitated?<br>
Who has experienced both extremes,<br>
but wise, in the middle does not stick?<br>
Who do you say’s a person great?<br>
Who, seamstress-craving’s gone beyond?</p>

A pure life leading ’mid pleasures of sense,<br>
ever mindful and craving-free,<br>
a bhikkhu cool, after reflection deep,<br>
agitation’s none in such a one.</p>

who the seamstress-craving’s gone beyond.</p>
