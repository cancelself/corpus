<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns580' href='#vns580'>SC Verse 580</a>Here’s the life of mortals,<br>
wretched and brief,<br>
its end unknown,<br>
to <i>dukkha</i> joined.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns581' href='#vns581'>SC Verse 581</a>There’s no means that those<br>
who’re born will never die.<br>
Reached decay, then death:<br>
the law for beings all.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns582' href='#vns582'>SC Verse 582</a>As with what’s ripe<br>
there’s always fear of falling,<br>
so for mortals born<br>
there’s always fear of death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns583' href='#vns583'>SC Verse 583</a>Just as a potter’s vessels<br>
made of clay all end<br>
by being broken, so<br>
death’s the end of life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns584' href='#vns584'>SC Verse 584</a>The young, those great in age,<br>
the fools, as well the wise<br>
all go under the sway<br>
of death, for death’s their goal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns585' href='#vns585'>SC Verse 585</a>Those overcome by death,<br>
to another world bound:<br>
father can’t protect his son,<br>
nor relatives their kin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns586' href='#vns586'>SC Verse 586</a>While relatives are watching,<br>
they weep and they lament;<br>
See mortals one by one,<br>
led as an ox to slaughter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns587' href='#vns587'>SC Verse 587</a>As the world’s afflicted<br>
by death and by decay,<br>
so the wise grieve not,<br>
knowing world’s nature well.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns588' href='#vns588'>SC Verse 588</a>Their path you do not know<br>
whereby they come, they go,<br>
neither end you see,<br>
useless your lament.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns589' href='#vns589'>SC Verse 589</a>While lamenting,<br>
The confused harm themselves;<br>
If any benefit could be found,<br>
Would not the wise do it to?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns590' href='#vns590'>SC Verse 590</a>Not by weeping and wailing,<br>
Can peace of mind be reached.<br>
It just creates more suffering,<br>
And distresses the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns591' href='#vns591'>SC Verse 591</a>You become thin and discolored,<br>
Harming yourself with your self;<br>
And the departed are not protected by this,<br>
Lamentation is pointless!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns592' href='#vns592'>SC Verse 592</a>When grief is not abandoned,<br>
A person falls into even more suffering;<br>
Wailing over the dead,<br>
They are overpowered by grief.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns593' href='#vns593'>SC Verse 593</a>See how others fare,<br>
People passing on according to their deeds;<br>
Creatures tremble,<br>
As they fall under the sway of Death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns594' href='#vns594'>SC Verse 594</a>Whatever you think it is,<br>
It becomes something else.<br>
Such is separation,<br>
See the way of the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns595' href='#vns595'>SC Verse 595</a>Even if a person were to live<br>
A hundred years or more,<br>
They would still be divided from their family,<br>
Abandoning this life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns596' href='#vns596'>SC Verse 596</a>That is why having heard the arahant,<br>
And dispelled lamentation;<br>
When you see the dead and departed,<br>
You don’t think you can get them back.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns597' href='#vns597'>SC Verse 597</a>Just as one would extinguish<br>
A burning building with water;<br>
So too a steadfast, wise one, a skilful, clever person,<br>
Would quickly blow away<br>
Grief when it arises,<br>
As wind, a tuft of cotton.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns598' href='#vns598'>SC Verse 598</a>One who is seeking happiness<br>
should draw out the painful dart—<br>
lamentations and longings—<br>
the grief that is within.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns599' href='#vns599'>SC Verse 599</a>Dart withdrawn and unattached,<br>
the mind attains to peace,<br>
passed beyond all grief,<br>
griefless, fires put out.</p>
