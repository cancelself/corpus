People say that in the world<br>
there are sages—how is this?<br>
Do they say “sage” for knowledge won,<br>
or for a certain way of life?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1085' href='#vns1085'>SC Verse 1085</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The intelligent ones say not “a sage”,<br>
for view, tradition, knowledge won;<br>
those foeless, desireless and free from distress<br>
who so fare along are sages, I say.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1086' href='#vns1086'>SC Verse 1086</a><span class='speaker'>Nanda</span><br>
Some of these monks and brahmins they say<br>
that purity comes from the seen and the heard,<br>
from rites and from vows and from other things too,<br>
have they, O Lord, while practising thus<br>
crossed over birth and crossed decay, sir?<br>
I ask the Lord thus, please tell me of this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1087' href='#vns1087'>SC Verse 1087</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Some of these monks and brahmins they say<br>
that purity comes from the seen and the heard,<br>
from rites and from vows and from other things too<br>
and even though they have practised thus,<br>
I say they’ve not crossed over birth and decay.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1088' href='#vns1088'>SC Verse 1088</a><span class='speaker'>Nanda</span><br>
Some of these monks and brahmins they say<br>
that purity comes from the seen and the heard,<br>
from rites and from vows and from other things too,<br>
if you say, O Sage, they’ve not crossed the flood,<br>
who fares through the world of devas, mankind,<br>
crossed over birth and crossed decay, sir?<br>
I ask the Lord thus, please tell me of this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1089' href='#vns1089'>SC Verse 1089</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Of these monks and these brahmins I do not say<br>
that all are shrouded by birth and decay:<br>
those who’ve let go of the seen, heard, and known,<br>
of rites and of vows and others—all,<br>
completely craving Known and from the inﬂows free—<br>
those persons I say have crossed over the flood.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1090' href='#vns1090'>SC Verse 1090</a><span class='speaker'>Nanda</span><br>
By the Great Seeker’s words I’m truly delighted<br>
well-explained, O Gotama, is “to assets unattached”,<br>
those who’ve let go of the seen, heard and known,<br>
of rites and of vows and of other things—all,<br>
completely craving Known and from the inﬂows free—<br>
also I say they’ve crossed over the flood.</p>
