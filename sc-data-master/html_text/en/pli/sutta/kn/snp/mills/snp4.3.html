<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns787' href='#vns787'>SC Verse 787</a>Some speak with wicked intent,<br>
while others are convinced their words are due,<br>
but whatever talk there is the sage enters no debate,<br>
therefore nowhere barren is the silent sage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns788' href='#vns788'>SC Verse 788</a>But a person led by his own desires,<br>
and then continuing accordingly finds it hard,<br>
to let them go, accepting his own thoughts as true,<br>
becomes one who speaks as a believer.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns789' href='#vns789'>SC Verse 789</a>So if a person without being asked,<br>
having practiced and praised virtues,<br>
even those of himself, invented by himself,<br>
the good say this is an ignoble act indeed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns790' href='#vns790'>SC Verse 790</a>But that bhikkhu who’s serene at heart<br>
and praises neither his own practices or virtue,<br>
not labelling himself “I” in “this”, the good praise him:<br>
“No arrogance has he for anything in the world”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns791' href='#vns791'>SC Verse 791</a>Who’s thoughts, imagined and put together, then prefer<br>
even though their source is not purified,<br>
seeing advantage for himself, he relies upon this,<br>
depending on what is imagined,<br>
constructed and conventional.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns792' href='#vns792'>SC Verse 792</a>When one has grasped<br>
from among many Dharma-doctrines,<br>
after due considerations one clings to a View,<br>
or condemns those of others,<br>
hence it’s not easy to transcend those Dharmas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns793' href='#vns793'>SC Verse 793</a>There is not in the world such a purified person<br>
who continues in these views about existential states,<br>
for this person of purity, let go of illusion and conceit,<br>
how can he be in any way reckoned?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns794' href='#vns794'>SC Verse 794</a>Who is attached still enters into doctrinal debates,<br>
but one unattached, how could he take sides?<br>
For him nothing is taken up or put down,<br>
With all views shaken off, relying on none.</p>
