To One illuming the past,<br>
the undisturbed who’s cut off doubt,<br>
Gone across the dharmas all,<br>
with this question have I come:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1120' href='#vns1120'>SC Verse 1120</a>In whom are no perceptions of form,<br>
abandoned it in bodies all,<br>
who sees within, without “there’s nought”,<br>
of such a one, what knowledge known<br>
how will such a one be led?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1121' href='#vns1121'>SC Verse 1121</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The Tathāgata knows thoroughly<br>
all supports of consciousness:<br>
knows this one as stuck,<br>
that one freed, or bound for the beyond.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1122' href='#vns1122'>SC Verse 1122</a>Having known the existence of no-thingness<br>
together with its bond of indulgence,<br>
then investigating this and seeing that,<br>
just this is the knowledge of a brahmin perfected.</p>
