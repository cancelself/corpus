<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1039' href='#vns1039'>SC Verse 1039</a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
The world, by what it’s wrapped?<br>
and why it shines not forth?<br>
say too with what it’s smeared?<br>
and what’s its greatest fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1040' href='#vns1040'>SC Verse 1040</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
The world is wrapped by Ignorance;<br>
It shines not forth due to doubt and negligence;<br>
Its smeared by longing,<br>
And suffering is its greatest fear.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1041' href='#vns1041'>SC Verse 1041</a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
The streams are flowing everywhere,<br>
how can the streams be blocked,<br>
say how the streams may be restrained?<br>
by what the streams are dammed?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1042' href='#vns1042'>SC Verse 1042</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Whatever streams are in the world,<br>
they may be blocked by mindfulness—<br>
that I say is streams’ restraint;<br>
by wisdom they are dammed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1043' href='#vns1043'>SC Verse 1043</a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
So wisdom it is and mindfulness!<br>
Now, sir, I ask you, tell me this:<br>
the namer-mind, the bodily form—<br>
where does it cease to be?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1044' href='#vns1044'>SC Verse 1044</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
That question asked by you<br>
I tell about it now,<br>
the namer-mind and bodily form<br>
where they cease to be:<br>
by cessation of the consciousness,<br>
they wholly cease to be.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1045' href='#vns1045'>SC Verse 1045</a><span class='speaker'>Ajita</span><br>
Who have the Dharma measured up,<br>
who train themselves, the multitude,<br>
how, sir, do they behave themselves?<br>
please answer what I speak.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1046' href='#vns1046'>SC Verse 1046</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
No greediness in pleasures of sense,<br>
having a tranquil mind and clear,<br>
skilled in all the Dharma’s ways—<br>
that mindful bhikkhu who’s left home.</p>
