<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“No, brahmins, there are no brahmins now to be seen who practise the Brahmin Dharma of the brahmins of old.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc39' href='#sc39'>SC 39</a>When this was said the brahmins of palatial abodes exclaimed to the Radiant One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was righting what had been overturned, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma and to the Saṅgha. May Master Gotama remember us as <i>upāsakas</i> who from today have Gone for Refuge for life.”</p>
