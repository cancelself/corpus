I ask the Kinsman of the Sun, the great seeker,<br>
About seclusion and the state of peace.<br>
Seeing what is a bhikkhu quenched,<br>
Not grasping at anything in the world?</p>

One should completely extract<br>
The root of proliferation and reckoning—<br>
The notion, “I am the thinker”.<br>
One should train to dispel whatever craving<br>
There is inside, ever mindful.</p>

Whether internally or externally,<br>
They would not be stubborn about that,<br>
For good people say that this is not quenching.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns925' href='#vns925'>SC Verse 925</a>You shouldn’t, on that account, think you are better,<br>

There are no waves, but all is still,<br>
So they would be still, unmoving;<br>
A bhikkhu is not haughty at all.</p>

You have taught me, with your eyes open,<br>
Seeing principles for yourself, dispelling dangers;<br>
Venerable sir, tell me the practice,<br>
The rules of conduct and also meditation.</p>

Prognosticate animal sounds,<br>
Practice fertility magic,<br>
Or [earn money] as a healer.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns935' href='#vns935'>SC Verse 935</a>A bhikkhu would not be anxious when criticized,<br>
