<h1>1.4. The Farmer Bhāradvaja</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At one time the Radiant One was dwelling among the Magadhans at South Mountain near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷā. Now at that time the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja had five hundred ploughs fastened to their yokes at the time of “planting”. Then in the morning the Radiant One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went to the place where the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja was working.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>At that time the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja’s food distribution was happening. Then the Radiant One approached the place for the distribution of food and stood to one side. The brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja saw the Radiant One standing for alms and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Samaṇa, I plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat. You too, samaṇa, ought to plough and plant; then when you have ploughed and planted, you will eat.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“But I too, brahmin, plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“But we do not see Master Gotama’s yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen; yet Master Gotama says, “I too brahmin, plough and plant, and when I have ploughed and planted, I eat.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Then the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja addressed the Radiant One in verse:</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns76' href='#vns76'>SC Verse 76</a><span class='speaker'>Kasī-Bhāradvāja</span><br>
A ploughman, so you claim to be<br>
but we see not your ploughmanship.<br>
If you’re a ploughman, answer me,<br>
make clear your ploughmanship!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns77' href='#vns77'>SC Verse 77</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
“With faith as seed and practice,<br>
rain and learning as my yoke and plough;<br>
my plough-pole, conscientiousness,<br>
memory, goad and ploughshare both.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns78' href='#vns78'>SC Verse 78</a>My body’s guarded, so is my speech,<br>
Restrained is my belly’s food,<br>
The act of Truth is my cutting-off,<br>
Gentleness is my release.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns79' href='#vns79'>SC Verse 79</a>My harnessed ox is energy—<br>
draws safe for yoking’s end,<br>
goes to where no sorrow is<br>
and turns not back again.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns80' href='#vns80'>SC Verse 80</a>In this way is my ploughing ploughed<br>
towards the crop of Deathlessness—<br>
who finishes this ploughing’s work<br>
from all <i>dukkha</i> will be free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>Then Kasī-Bhāradvāja had a large bronze bowl filled with milk-rice and brought to the Radiant One. “May it please Master Gotama to eat the milk-rice, Master Gotama is a ploughman, since he does the ploughing that has the Deathless as its crop.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns81' href='#vns81'>SC Verse 81</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Chanting sacred verses for comestibles<br>
is not done by me;<br>
for those who rightly See, Brahmin,<br>
it accords not with Dharma.<br>
Chanting sacred verses thus<br>
is rejected by the Buddhas,<br>
such is the Dharma, Brahmin,<br>
such is their practice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns82' href='#vns82'>SC Verse 82</a>A great seer with Final Knowledge, conflicts stilled.<br>
one who has exhausted taints, is wholly free—<br>
make offerings of food and drink to such a one:<br>
the certain field for one who merit seeks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>When this was said the brahmin Kasī-Bhāradvāja exclaimed to the Radiant One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was righting what had been overturned, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see forms. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. May Master Gotama remember me as an <i>upāsaka</i> who from today has gone for Refuge for life.”</p>
