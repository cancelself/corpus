<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns319' href='#vns319'>SC Verse 319</a>As devas do venerate their lord, Indra king,<br>
so likewise to that person from whom one knows Dharma,<br>
respected, clear-minded, and very learned too,<br>
that teacher makes manifest the words of the Dharma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns320' href='#vns320'>SC Verse 320</a>This having considered then, the wise person,<br>
while practising Dharma according with Dharma,<br>
becomes learned, intelligent, subtle-minded too,<br>
by diligently dwelling with one who is Such.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns321' href='#vns321'>SC Verse 321</a>But by following the foolish, inferior fellow,<br>
who’s not found Dharma’s goal, while envious of others,<br>
to death one will come before Dharma knowing,<br>
not having crossed over (the river of doubts).</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns322' href='#vns322'>SC Verse 322</a>Just as a person going into a river<br>
swollen in flood and very swiftly flowing,<br>
would be carried away by the force of the current—<br>
then how can this person help others across?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns323' href='#vns323'>SC Verse 323</a>So it’s the same with the unpractised person,<br>
who knows not the Dharma as explained by the wise,<br>
sans knowledge profound, not crossed over doubting:<br>
how could this person cause others to Know?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns324' href='#vns324'>SC Verse 324</a>But one who does on a strong boat embark,<br>
furnished with oars and rudder complete,<br>
as skilled in the means, with wisdom as well,<br>
that one can take so many others across.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns325' href='#vns325'>SC Verse 325</a>Of mind developed deeply, one who Knows truly,<br>
one of great learning, or unshakeable Dharma,<br>
other people can lead who possess the capacity<br>
to listen attentively and penetrate deeply.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns326' href='#vns326'>SC Verse 326</a>Therefore be sure to frequent a True person,<br>
an intelligent one who is of great learning,<br>
realized in the meaning, practised on the Path,<br>
a Knower of Dharma attained to the Bliss.</p>
