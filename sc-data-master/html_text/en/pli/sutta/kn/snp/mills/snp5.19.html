“Going to the Further Shore”, I’ll chant—<br>
As He had Seen so did He teach,<br>
that pure One of wisdom profound,<br>
rid of desire and (interior) jungle—<br>
falsehood—for what reason would he speak?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1139' href='#vns1139'>SC Verse 1139</a>Now therefore I shall eulogize<br>
those words profoundly beautiful,<br>
of One who has renounced the stains<br>
of delusion, pride, hypocrisy.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1140' href='#vns1140'>SC Verse 1140</a>All-seer, Awake, Dispeller of dark,<br>
beyond all being gone, gone to world’s end,<br>
with no inﬂows left, let go of all <i>dukkha</i>-causes,<br>
that one is “brahmin” rightly named: him do I serve.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1141' href='#vns1141'>SC Verse 1141</a>As bird that leaves behind a copse,<br>
might then in fruit-filled forest live,<br>
so have I left those of wisdom lean,<br>
as swan to a great lake arrived.</p>

I heard the Buddha’s utterance,<br>
said “thus it was”, “thus will be”—<br>
all that was only oral lore,<br>
all that promoted more disputes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1143' href='#vns1143'>SC Verse 1143</a>Dispeller of darkness, seated alone,<br>
the well-born, him the maker of Light,<br>
Gotama, him profoundly wise,<br>
Gotama, greatly intelligent—</p>

which can be seen right here and now,<br>
by time, not limited at all,<br>
craving’s exhaustion, troubles’ end,<br>
with which naught can compare.</p>

How can you live apart from him,<br>
Even for a minute, Piṅgiya?<br>
Gotama of such profound wisdom,<br>
Gotama of such profound sagacity.</p>

Apparent in this very life,<br>
The ending of craving, free of distress,<br>
With which naught can compare.</p>

Being heedful night and day;<br>
I spend the night revering him,<br>
So I think I am never apart from him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns1150' href='#vns1150'>SC Verse 1150</a>The mind of faith and rapture, mindfulness,<br>
from Gotama’s teachings never does depart,<br>
for in whoever way the Deeply-Wise One goes,<br>
to that very direction do I bow down.</p>

Just as Vakkali was sure in faith,<br>
Bhadrāvudha, and Āḷavigotama, too,<br>
In the same way, you too should be sure of your faith,<br>
And, Piṅgiya, you will go to the far shore of death.</p>

Thus my inspiration grows even more,<br>
Hearing the voice of the Sage;<br>
The Buddha, who drew back the veil of the world,<br>
Without heartlessness, of inspired speech,</p>

Knows all, both high and low,<br>
The Teacher who puts and end to questions<br>
Of those who declare their doubts.</p>

That to which there is no compare:<br>
For sure, I will go there,<br>
I have no doubt of that.<br>
You may remember me<br>
As one who’s mind is made up.</p>
