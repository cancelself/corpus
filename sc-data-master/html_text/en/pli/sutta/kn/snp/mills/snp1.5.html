I ask of the Sage abundantly wise,<br>
Buddha, Lord of Dharma, one who’s craving-free,<br>
Best among men, charioteer beyond compare,<br>
Please do tell me what sorts of samaṇas there are.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns84' href='#vns84'>SC Verse 84</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Asked by you personally I shall explain:<br>
Four are the samaṇas, not a fifth is found—<br>
Won to the Path, of the Path the Indicator,<br>
Who lives upon the Path, as well the Path-polluter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns85' href='#vns85'>SC Verse 85</a><span class='speaker'>Cunda</span><br>
Who do the Buddhas say is winner of the Path?<br>
How will the Path-teacher be incomparable?<br>
Tell about that one who lives upon the Path,<br>
Also the one who is the Path-polluter?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns86' href='#vns86'>SC Verse 86</a><span class='speaker'>Buddha</span><br>
Whoso has passed beyond the dart of doubts,<br>
Nirvāṇa-delighted, no greediness at all,<br>
Leader of the world together with the gods,<br>
is Such, the Path-winner, so the Buddhas say.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns87' href='#vns87'>SC Verse 87</a>Who knows the Best as what is best indeed,<br>
then teaches Dharma and analyses it,<br>
a sage all doubt severed, one undisturbed,<br>
they call bhikkhu number two, indicator of the Path.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns88' href='#vns88'>SC Verse 88</a>Who lives on the Way, the well-taught Dharma Path,<br>
one well-trained and mindful as well,<br>
whatever’s unobstructing, a practitioner of that<br>
they call bhikkhu number three, one who lives the Path.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns89' href='#vns89'>SC Verse 89</a>Making a semblance of those with good vows,<br>
deceitful one, worthless and quite unrestrained,<br>
Insolent, braggart and family-defiler,<br>
who goes in disguise is polluter of the Path.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns90' href='#vns90'>SC Verse 90</a>A noble disciple who’s recognised each and every one,<br>
and knowing that among them, all are not alike,<br>
this having seen, that person’s faith does not decrease.<br>
For how with the corrupt<br>
can the uncorrupted be compared?<br>
Or those purified with those who are impure?</p>
