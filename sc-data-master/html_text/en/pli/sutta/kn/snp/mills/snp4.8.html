<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns831' href='#vns831'>SC Verse 831</a>They say: “In our Dharma purity’s found”<br>
but deny that it is found in the Dharma of others.<br>
On what they depend they say “it’s the best”,<br>
and so settle down in their individual truths.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns832' href='#vns832'>SC Verse 832</a>Those disputants into the assembly rush,<br>
and perceive opposedly “the other” as a fool.<br>
But in disputes, on others they rely—<br>
these so-called experts ever-loving praise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns833' href='#vns833'>SC Verse 833</a>Engrossed in conflict midst the assembly,<br>
fearing defeat, they wish only for praise,<br>
having been refuted, that one’s truly confused,<br>
angry at blame seeks weakness in the other.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns834' href='#vns834'>SC Verse 834</a>“Through investigation is your argument<br>
refuted and destroyed”—so they say.<br>
That one grieves and laments—that mere arguer,<br>
“Oh! I am overcome” that person wails.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns835' href='#vns835'>SC Verse 835</a>Arisen among monks—those controversies<br>
among them cause both elation and depression.<br>
Refrain therefore, from disputation!<br>
No meaning’s in it save the prize of praise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns836' href='#vns836'>SC Verse 836</a>Praised in the midst of the assembly<br>
for the presentation of arguments,<br>
then that one laughs, or else is haughty.<br>
So they say, “Conceited by winning debate”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns837' href='#vns837'>SC Verse 837</a>Though haughtiness will be ground for a downfall,<br>
still proudly that one speaks, and with arrogance:<br>
this having seen, refrain from disputations—<br>
not by that is there purity, so the skilled say.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns838' href='#vns838'>SC Verse 838</a>Just as a strong man, fed<br>
upon royal food, might roar forth,<br>
wishing for a champion rival,<br>
but finds from the first there’s nought to fight.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns839' href='#vns839'>SC Verse 839</a>Those holding a view and disputing, say thus:<br>
“This alone is the truth”, so they aver;<br>
then reply to them: “But no one’s here<br>
to retaliate through disputation”.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns840' href='#vns840'>SC Verse 840</a>They continue with their practice, offering no opposition<br>
against others, offering no view opposed to view.<br>
But then, Pasūra, what would you obtain?<br>
For them there is nothing to be grasped as the highest.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns841' href='#vns841'>SC Verse 841</a>As you’ve come here, in your mind<br>
thinking and speculating on various views,<br>
you have met with a Washed One<br>
But will not be able to make progress with him.</p>
