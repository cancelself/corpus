<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>The Radiant One said this while he stayed among the Magadhese at the Pāsānika Shrine. There he was asked, then he questioned, the sixteen brahmin pupils, answering their questions. If one should understand the meaning of even one question, and then practise the Dharma according to the Dharma, then one would go to the farther shore beyond ageing and death. As this Dharma leads to the farther shore it is known as the Teaching leading to the Farther Shore (<i>pārāyana</i>).</p>
