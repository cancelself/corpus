<h1>3.4. To Sundarika-Bhāradvāja on Offerings</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At one time the Radiant One was dwelling among the Kosalans. At that time the brahmin Sundarika-Bhāradvāja performed on the bank of the Sundarika river the fire sacrifice and offered the fire-ritual. Having completed the sacrifice and ritual the brahmin rose from his seat and surveyed the four directions, thinking, “Who will partake of the remains of this sacrifice?” It happened then that the brahmin saw the Radiant One seated at the foot of a tree not far away, but with his head covered. Seeing him, the brahmin grasped the sacrificial remains in his left hand and a water-vessel in his right and approached the Radiant One who, hearing his approach, uncovered his head. Then the brahmin thought:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“This venerable one is shaven-headed, a mere shaveling” and desired to turn back. But it occurred to him: “Though shaven-headed there are some brahmins here like this. It would be good to inquire about his ‘birth’.” Then Sundarika-Bhāradvāja the brahmin approached the Radiant One and having done so, said this: “Of what ‘birth’ is the venerable one?” Then the Radiant One addressed these verses to the brahmin:</p>

No brahmin am I, nor son of royalty,<br>
nor of merchant stock, nor any other (caste),<br>
for I know very well ordinary people’s line<br>
so wisely, having nothing, I fare through the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns459' href='#vns459'>SC Verse 459</a>My robe is my dwelling, I live in no house,<br>
My head is shaven, I am fully quenched;<br>
Not clinging to any students here,<br>
It is not appropriate, brahmin, to ask me of my clan.</p>

But brahmins, sir, of brahmins always ask<br>
“Are you as well a brahmin, friend?”</p>

If you say you brahmin are, but call me none,<br>
then of you I ask the chant of Sāvitrī,<br>
consisting of three lines<br>
in four and twenty syllables.</p>

On what do they rely, these seers,<br>
born human, the nobles and brahmins, all of them,<br>
that to the devas they sacrifices make<br>
to bring about results here in this world?</p>

One gone to the End, one who’s gone to Knowledge,<br>
at the time of sacrifice receives that offering,<br>
and that will be a blessing, I say.</p>

Then for sure will be fruitful this my sacrifice,<br>
because we have seen one such as yourself—<br>
one gone to Knowledge, for if seeing not,<br>
another would have eaten the sacrificial cake.</p>

Well then, brahmin, you should ask,<br>
since you have come to seek the meaning.<br>
Perhaps you will find here a Wise One,<br>
Peaceful, clear, unsoiled, desireless.</p>

If that is so, O brahmin, lend your ears,<br>
and in the Dharma I shall instruct you.<br>
Ask not of “birth” but of behaviour enquire—<br>
truly from sticks of wood the sacred fire is born,<br>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc38' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a>When this was said, the brahmin Sundarika-Bhāradvāja said to the Radiant One: “Magnificent, master Gotama! The Dharma has been clarified by Master Gotama in many ways, as though he was righting what was overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes can see forms. I go for Refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dharma, and to the Bhikkhu-Saṅgha that I may receive the Leaving home from the venerable Gotama with ordination.” Then the brahmin Sundarika-Bhāradvāja received this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc39' href='#sc39'>SC 39</a>Not long after his ordination the venerable, living in solitude, secluded, diligent and zealous by realizing from himself with Direct Knowledge here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the Good Life for the sake of which clansmen rightly leave home for homelessness. He Knew directly: birth is destroyed, the Good Life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being. And the venerable Sundarika-Bhāradvāja became one of the arahants.</p>
