I’ve heard of the heroic one<br>
from desires free for pleasures sensuous,<br>
with Question I come for the flood-crosser,<br>
from desire free<br>
O Lord with Eye innate, tell me the Peaceful State—<br>
how truly it is, tell me of this.</p>

as the hot sun the earth by its heat,<br>
of small wit am I, Thou of wisdom great,<br>
explain to me Dharma that I may understand.</p>

The abandonment here of birth and old age,<br>
greed for sensual pleasures curb,<br>
and safety see in letting-go,<br>
let there not be found in you<br>
grasping or rejection.</p>

for every sort of name-and-form,<br>
the inﬂows are not found by which<br>
one’d go beneath death’s sway.</p>
