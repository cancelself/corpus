<h1 class='sutta-title'>3.9. The Discourse to Vāseṭṭha</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in the forest grove near Icchānaṇgala. On this occasion many famous, wealthy brahmins were living in Icchānaṇgala, such as the brahmin Caṅki, the brahmin Tārukkha, the brahmin Pokkharasāti, the brahmin Jāṇussoni, the brahmin Todeyya, and other famous, wealthy brahmins. Then while the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were walking for exercise, this conversation arose: “How is one a brahmin?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>The student Bhāradvāja said, “Sir, when one is well-born on both one‘s maternal side and paternal side, of pure descent as far back as the seventh ancestor with no disruption, irreproachable in terms of birth – then one is a brahmin.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The student Vāseṭṭha said, “Sir, when one is virtuous and well-behaved, then one is a brahmin.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Bhāradvāja was not able to convince Vāseṭṭha, and Vāseṭṭha was not able to convince Bhāradvāja.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Then Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, “Sir Bhāradvāja, the contemplative Gotama, a son of the Sakyan clan who become a renunciate, now dwells in the forest grove near Icchānaṇgala. A good rumor has been spread about that honorable Gotama which says, ‘He is the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the fully self-enlightened one, perfect in knowledge and conduct, sublime, the world-knower, the unsurpassed teacher of devas and humans, the Awakened One, the Blessed One.’ Come, Sir Bhāradvāja, we will approach the Blessed One and ask him about this. We will hold it in whatever way the Blessed One explains it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Yes, sir,” Bhāradvāja replied to Vāseṭṭha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Then Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja approached the Blessed One and conversed with him. When the appropriate polite conversation was finished they sat to one side. When they were seated to one side, Vāseṭṭha addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“We are both sanctioned and acknowledged as bearers of the Three Knowledges;</p>
