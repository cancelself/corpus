<h1>The Hymn of Universal Love</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Who seeks to promote his welfare,<br>
Having glimpsed the state of perfect peace,<br>
Should be able, honest and upright,<br>
Gentle in speech, meek and not proud.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Contented, he ought to be easy to support,<br>
Not over-busy, and simple in living.<br>
Tranquil his senses, let him be prudent,<br>
And not brazen, nor fawning on families.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Also, he must refrain from any action<br>
That gives the wise reason to reprove him.<br>
<span class='add'>(Then let him cultivate the thought:)</span><br>
May all be well and secure,<br>
May all beings be happy!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Whatever living creatures there be,<br>
Without exception, weak or strong,<br>
Long, huge or middle-sized,<br>
Or short, minute or bulky,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Whether visible or invisible,<br>
And those living far or near,<br>
The born and those seeking birth,<br>
May all beings be happy</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Let none deceive or decry<br>
His fellow anywhere;<br>
Let none wish others harm<br>
In resentment or in hate.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Just as with her own life<br>
A mother shields from hurt<br>
Her own son, her only child,<br>
Let all-embracing thoughts<br>
For all beings be yours.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>Cultivate an all-embracing mind of love<br>
For all throughout the universe,<br>
In all its height, depth and breadth—<br>
Love that is untroubled<br>
And beyond hatred or enmity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>As you stand, walk, sit or lie,<br>
So long as you are awake,<br>
Pursue this awareness with your might:<br>
It is deemed the Divine State here.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>Holding no more to wrong beliefs,<br>
With virtue and vision of the ultimate,<br>
And having overcome all sensual desire,<br>
Never in a womb is one born again.</p>
