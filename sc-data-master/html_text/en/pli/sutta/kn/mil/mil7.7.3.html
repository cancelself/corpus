<h1>7.7.3. The Land Tortoise</h1>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3' href='#pts-cs3'>PTS cs 3</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, that one quality of the land tortoise which you say he ought to take, which is it?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the land tortoise, being afraid of the water, frequents places far from it, and by that habit of avoiding water its length of life is kept undiminished; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, seeing the danger in the want of earnestness, be mindful of the advantages that distinguish earnestness. For by that perception of <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en353' href='#pts-vp-en353'>PTS vp En 353</a> danger in carelessness, his Samanaship fades not away, but rather does he go forward to Nirvāṇa itself. This, O king, is the quality of the land tortoise he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Dhammapada:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The Bhikshu who in earnestness delights,<br>
Who sees the danger of indifference,<br>
Shall fall not from his high estate away,<br>
But in the presence of Nirvāṇa dwell.”’</p>
