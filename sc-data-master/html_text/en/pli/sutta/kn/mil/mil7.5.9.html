<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16' href='#pts-cs16'>PTS cs 16</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the boar you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the boar, in the sultry and scorching weather of the hot season, resorts to the water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when his heart is distracted and ready to fall, all in a whirl, inflamed by anger, resort to the cool, ambrosial, sweet water of the meditation on love. This, O king, is the first quality of the boar he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17' href='#pts-cs17'>PTS cs 17</a> ‘And again, O king, as the boar, resorting to muddy water, digs into the swamp with his snout, and making a trough for himself, lies down therein; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, put his body away in his mind, and <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en335' href='#pts-vp-en335'>PTS vp En 335</a> lie down in the midst of contemplation. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli398' href='#pts-vp-pli398'>PTS vp Pali 398</a> This, O king, is the second quality of the boar he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Piṇḍola Bhāradvaja, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Alone, with no one near, the man of insight,<br>
Searching into and finding out the nature<br>
Of this body, can lay him down to rest<br>
On the sweet bed of contemplations deep.”’</p>
