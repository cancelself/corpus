<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10' href='#pts-cs10'>PTS cs 10</a> The king said: ‘By what, Nāgasena, does one recollect what is past and done long ago?’</p>
<p>‘By memory.’</p>
<p>‘But is it not by the mind, not by the memory, that we recollect?’</p>
<p>‘Do you recollect any business, O king, that you have done and then forgotten?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘What then? Were you then without a mind?’ <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en121' href='#pts-vp-en121'>PTS vp En 121</a> </p>
<p>‘No. But my memory failed me.’</p>
<p>‘Then why do you say that it is by the mind, not by the memory, that we recollect?’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena ’</p>
