<p>‘Just, O king, as food is the support of all beings, just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be a handle, as it were, by which all beings may open the door of the noble eightfold path. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of food he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13' href='#pts-cs13'>PTS cs 13</a> ‘And again, O king, just as food increases people’s strength; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, grow in increase of virtue. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of food he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14' href='#pts-cs14'>PTS cs 14</a> ‘And again, O king, just as food is a thing desired of all beings; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be desired of all the world. This, O king, is the third of the qualities of food he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mahā Moggallāna, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“By self-restraint, training, and righteousness,<br>
By duty done, and by attainments reached,<br>
The strenuous recluse should make himself<br>
To all men in the world a thing desired “’</p>
