<p>‘No, there is not.’</p>
<p>‘But if so, would it not get free from its evil deeds.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, if it were not reborn; but if it were, no.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Suppose, O king, a man were to steal another man’s mangoes, would the thief deserve punishment?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘But he would not have stolen the mangoes the other set in the ground. Why would he deserve punishment?’</p>
<p>‘Because those he stole were the result of those that were planted.’</p>
<p>‘Just so, great king, this name-and-form commits deeds, either pure or impure, and by that Karma another name-and-form. is reborn. And therefore is it not set free from its evil deeds?’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
