<p>‘Just, O king, as the white ant goes on with his work only when he has made a roof over himself, and covered himself up; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, on his round for alms, cover up his mind with righteousness and self-restraint as a roof. For in so doing, O king, will he have passed beyond all fear. This, O king, is the one quality of the white ant he ought to have. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli393' href='#pts-vp-pli393'>PTS vp Pali 393</a> For it was said, O king, by Upasena Vaṅgantaputta, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The devotee who covers up his mind,<br>
Under the sheltering roof of righteousness<br>
And self-control, untarnished by the world<br>
Remains, and is set free from every fear.”’</p>
