<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6' href='#pts-cs6'>PTS cs 6</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, that one quality of the mungoose you say he ought to take, which is it?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the mungoose, when attacking a snake, only does so when he has covered his body with an antidote; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, when going into the world where anger and hatred are rife, which is under the sway of quarrels, strife, disputes, and enmities, ever keep his mind anointed with the antidote of love. This, O king, is the quality of the mungoose he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Therefore should love be felt for one’s own kin,<br>
And so for strangers too, and the whole wide world<br>
Should be pervaded with a heart of love—<br>
This is the doctrine of the Buddhas all.”’</p>
