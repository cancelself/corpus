<h1>3.3.11. Purpose</h1>

<p>‘What is the distinguishing characteristic, Nāgasena, of the conceived purpose (cetanā)?’</p>
<p>‘The being conceived, O king, and the being prepared.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘It is like the case of a man, O king, who should prepare poison, and both drink of it himself, and give of it to others to drink. He himself would suffer pain, and so would they. In the same way some individual, having thought out with intention some evil deed, on the dissolution of the body after death, would be reborn into some unhappy state of woe in purgatory, and so also would those who followed his advice.—And it is like the case of a <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en95' href='#pts-vp-en95'>PTS vp En 95</a> man, O king, who should prepare a mixture of ghee, butter, oil, honey and molasses, and should both drink thereof himself and give of it to others to drink. He himself would have pleasure, and so would they. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli62' href='#pts-vp-pli62'>PTS vp Pali 62</a> In the same way some individual, having thought out with intention some good deed, will be reborn, on the dissolution of the body after death, into some happy state of bliss in heaven, and so also would those who follow his advice. Thus is it, great king, that the being conceived, and the being prepared, are marks of the conceived purpose.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
