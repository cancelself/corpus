<h1>3.7.2. The time of death</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2' href='#pts-cs2'>PTS cs 2</a> The king said: ‘Your people say, Nāgasena, that though a man should have lived a hundred <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en124' href='#pts-vp-en124'>PTS vp En 124</a> years an evil life, yet if, at the moment of death, thoughts of the Buddha should enter his mind, he will be reborn among the gods. This I don’t believe. And thus do they also say: “By one case of destruction of life a man may be reborn in purgatory.” That, too, I cannot believe.’</p>
<p>‘But tell me, O king. Would even a tiny stone float on the water without a boat?’</p>
<p>‘Certainly not.’</p>
<p>‘Very well; but would not a hundred cart-loads of stones float on the water if they were loaded in a boat?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, they would float right enough.’</p>
<p>‘Well, good deeds are like the boat.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
