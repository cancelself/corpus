<h1>7.7.7. The Diamond</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17' href='#pts-cs17'>PTS cs 17</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, those three qualities of the diamond you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the diamond is pure throughout; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be perfectly pure in his means of livelihood. This, O king, is the first quality of the diamond he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18' href='#pts-cs18'>PTS cs 18</a> ‘And again, O king, as the diamond cannot <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en358' href='#pts-vp-en358'>PTS vp En 358</a> be alloyed with any other substance; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never mix with wicked men as friends. This, O king, is the second quality of the diamond he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19' href='#pts-cs19'>PTS cs 19</a> ‘And again, O king, just as the diamond is set together with the most costly gems; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, associate with those of the higher excellence, with men who have entered the first or the second or the third stage of the Noble Path, with the jewel treasures of the Arahats, of the recluses, of the threefold Wisdom, or of the sixfold Insight. This, O king, is the third quality of the diamond he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the Sutta Nipāta:</p>

<p>“Let the pure associate with the pure,<br>
Ever in recollection firm;<br>
Dwelling harmoniously wise<br>
Thus shall ye put an end to griefs.”’</p>
