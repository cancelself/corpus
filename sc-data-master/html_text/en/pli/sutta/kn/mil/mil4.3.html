<h1>4.3. Kinds of people who spill secrets</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6' href='#pts-cs6'>PTS cs 6</a> ‘There are nine kinds of people, Nāgasena, who let out a secret that has been talked over with them, and treasure it not up in their hearts. And who are the nine? the lustful man reveals it in obedience to some lust, the ill-tempered man in consequence <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en141' href='#pts-vp-en141'>PTS vp En 141</a> of some ill-will, the deluded man under some mistake. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli93' href='#pts-vp-pli93'>PTS vp Pali 93</a> The timid man reveals it through fear, and the man greedy for gain to get something out of it. A woman reveals it through infirmity, a drunkard in his eagerness for drink, a eunuch because of his imperfection, and a child through fickleness. Therefore is it said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The lustful, angry, or bewildered man,<br>
The timid man, and he who seeks for gain,<br>
A woman, drunkard, eunuch, or a child—<br>
These nine are fickle, wavering, and mean.<br>
When secret things are talked over to them<br>
They straightway become public property.”’</p>
