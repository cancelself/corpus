<h1>3.7.10. Long bones</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10' href='#pts-cs10'>PTS cs 10</a> The king said: ‘Your people say there are bones even a hundred leagues long. Now there is no tree even one hundred leagues in length, how then can there be bones so long?’</p>
<p>‘But tell me, O king. Have you not heard of fishes in the sea five hundred leagues in length?’</p>
<p>‘Yes. I have heard of such.’</p>
<p>‘If so, could they not have bones a hundred leagues long?’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
