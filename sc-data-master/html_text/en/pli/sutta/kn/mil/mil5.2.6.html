This too is a double-pointed problem, hard to master, hard to overcome. It is now put to you, and you have to solve it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs28' href='#pts-cs28'>PTS cs 28</a> ‘Both the passages you quote, O king, were spoken by the Blessed One. But there is a difference between the sense of the two. And what is that difference? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli159' href='#pts-vp-pli159'>PTS vp Pali 159</a> There is a kind of offence which is committed without the co-operation of the mind, and there is another kind which has that co-operation. It was with respect to the first of the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en225' href='#pts-vp-en225'>PTS vp En 225</a> two that the Blessed One said: “’There is no offence to him who acts in ignorance.”’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.’</p>
<p class='endsection'>Here ends the dilemma as to sins in ignorance.</p>
