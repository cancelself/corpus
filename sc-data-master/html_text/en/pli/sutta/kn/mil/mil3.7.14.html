<h1>3.7.14. Dividing</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14' href='#pts-cs14'>PTS cs 14</a> The king said: ‘Can even the most minute thing, Nāgasena, be divided?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, it can.’</p>
<p>‘And what, Sir, is the most minute of all things.’</p>
<p>‘Truth (Dhamma), O king, is the most minute and subtle. But this is not true of all qualities (Dhammā). Subtleness or the reverse are epithets of qualities. But whatever can be divided that can wisdom (Paññā) divide, and there is no other quality which can divide wisdom.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
