<h1>6.2.2. Dilemma the Sixty-Second. The Lay Arahat</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7' href='#pts-cs7'>PTS cs 7</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, your people say:</p>
<p>“Whosoever has attained, as a layman, to Arahatship, one of two conditions are possible to him, and no other—either that very day he enters the Order, or he dies away, for beyond that day he cannot last.”</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli265' href='#pts-vp-pli265'>PTS vp Pali 265</a> ‘Now if, Nāgasena, he could not, on that day, procure a teacher or preceptor, or a bowl and set of robes, would he then, being an Arahat, admit himself, or would he live over the day, or would some other Arahat suddenly appear by the power of Iddhi and admit him, or would he die away?’</p>
<p>‘He could not, O king, because he is an Arahat, admit himself. For any one admitting himself to <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en97' href='#pts-vp-en97'>PTS vp En 97</a> The Order is guilty of theft. And he could not last beyond that day. Whether another Arahat should happen, or not, to arrive, on that very day would he die away.’</p>
<p>‘Then, Nāgasena, by whatever means attained, the holy condition of Arahatship is thereby also lost, for destruction of life is involved in it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8' href='#pts-cs8'>PTS cs 8</a> ‘It is the condition of laymanship which is at fault, O king. In that faulty condition, and by reason of the weakness of the condition itself, the layman who, as such, has attained to Arahatship must either, that very day, enter the Order or die away. That is not the fault of Arahatship, O king. It is laymanship that is at fault, through not being strong enough.</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as food, that guards the growth and protects the life of all beings, will, through indigestion, take away the life of one whose stomach is unequal to it, whose internal fire is low and weak—just so if a layman attains Arahatship when in that condition unequal to it, then by reason of the weakness of the condition he must, that very day, either enter the Order or die away.</p>
<p>‘Or just, O king, as a tiny blade of grass when a heavy rock is placed upon it will, through its weakness, break off and give way—just so when a layman attains Arahatship, then, unable to support Arahatship in that condition, he must, that very day, either enter the Order or die away.</p>
<p>‘Or just, O king, as a poor weak fellow of low birth and little ability, if he came into possession of <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en98' href='#pts-vp-en98'>PTS vp En 98</a> a great and mighty kingdom, would be unable to support the dignity of it —just so if a layman attains to Arahatship, then is he unable, in that condition, to support it. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli266' href='#pts-vp-pli266'>PTS vp Pali 266</a> And that is the reason why he must, on that very day, either enter the Order or die away.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena! That is so, and I accept it as you say.’</p>
<p class='endsection'>Here ends the dilemma as to the lay Arahat.</p>
