<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs43' href='#pts-cs43'>PTS cs 43</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, the three qualities of Sakka (the king of the gods) which you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as Sakka enjoys perfect bliss; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rejoice in the perfect bliss of retirement. This, O king, is the first quality of Sakka he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs44' href='#pts-cs44'>PTS cs 44</a> ‘And again, O king, as when Sakka when he sees his gods around him keeps them in his favour, fills them with joy; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep his mind detached, alert, and tranquil, should make joy spring up within him, should rouse himself, exert himself, be full of zeal. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli391' href='#pts-vp-pli391'>PTS vp Pali 391</a> This, O king is the second quality of Sakka he ought to have. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en323' href='#pts-vp-en323'>PTS vp En 323</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs45' href='#pts-cs45'>PTS cs 45</a> ‘And again, O king, as Sakka feels no discontent; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never allow himself to become discontented with solitude. This, O king, is the third quality of Sakka he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Subhūti, the Elder:</p>

I will not grant that any thought of lust<br>
Or craving care has risen in my breast.”’</p>
