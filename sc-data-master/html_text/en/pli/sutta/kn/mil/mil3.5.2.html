They who have never seen the ocean would they know concerning <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en110' href='#pts-vp-en110'>PTS vp En 110</a> it: “Deep, unmeasurable, unfathomable is the mighty ocean. Into it do the five great rivers flow—the Ganges, the Jumna, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, and the Mahī—and yet is there in it no appearance of being more empty or more full!”?’</p>
