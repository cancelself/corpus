<h1>7.7.4. The Mountain Height</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4' href='#pts-cs4'>PTS cs 4</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, those five qualities of the mountain height you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the mountain height is a hiding-place for the wicked; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep secret the offences and failings of others, revealing them not. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the mountain height he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5' href='#pts-cs5'>PTS cs 5</a> ‘And again, O king, just as the mountain height is void of many people; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli409' href='#pts-vp-pli409'>PTS vp Pali 409</a> earnest in effort, be void of lust, angers, follies, and pride, of the net of (wrong) views, and of all evil dispositions. This, O king, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en354' href='#pts-vp-en354'>PTS vp En 354</a> is the second quality of the mountain height he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6' href='#pts-cs6'>PTS cs 6</a> ‘And again, O king, just as the mountain height is a lonely spot, free from crowding of men; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be given to solitude, and free from evil, unworthy qualities, from those that are not noble. This, O king, is the third quality of the mountain height he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7' href='#pts-cs7'>PTS cs 7</a> ‘And again, O king, just as the mountain height is clean and pure; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be good and pure, happy, and without self-righteousness. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the mountain height he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8' href='#pts-cs8'>PTS cs 8</a> ‘And again, O king, just as the mountain height is the resort of the noble ones; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be sought after by the noble ones. This, O king, is the fifth quality of the mountain height he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Saṁyutta Nikāya:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“With solitary men, those noble ones,<br>
Whose minds, on Arahatship strictly bent,<br>
Rise easily to contemplation’s heights,<br>
Stedfast in zeal and wise in holy writ—<br>
With such should he resort, with such commune.”’</p>
