<h1>3.3.8. Contact, sensation, and idea</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8' href='#pts-cs8'>PTS cs 8</a> The king said: ‘Where thought (mental perception) is, Nāgasena, is there always sensation?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, where thought arises there is contact, and there is sensation, and there is idea, and there is conceived intention, and there is reflection; and there is investigation.’</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9' href='#pts-cs9'>PTS cs 9</a> ‘Reverend Sir, what is the distinguishing characteristic of contact (Phassa)?’</p>
<p>‘Touch, O king.’</p>
<p>‘But give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘It is as when two rams are butting together, O <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en93' href='#pts-vp-en93'>PTS vp En 93</a> king. The eye should be regarded as one of those two, the form (object) as the other, and the contact as the union of the two.’</p>
<p>‘Give me a further illustration.’</p>
<p>‘It is as when two cymbals are clashed together. The one is as the eye, the other as the object, and the junction of the two is like contact.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
