<p>‘Just, O king, as the hunter is indefatigable, so also, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be indefatigable. This, O king, is the first quality of the hunter he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21' href='#pts-cs21'>PTS cs 21</a> ‘And again, O king, just as the hunter keeps his attention fixed on the deer; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, keep his <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en359' href='#pts-vp-en359'>PTS vp En 359</a> attention fixed on the particular object which is the subject of his thought. This, O king, is the second quality of the hunter he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22' href='#pts-cs22'>PTS cs 22</a> ‘And again, O king, just as the hunter knows the right time for his work; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, know the right time for retirement, saying to himself: “Now is the right time to retire. Now is the right time to come out of retirement.” This, O king, is the third quality of the hunter he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs23' href='#pts-cs23'>PTS cs 23</a> ‘And again, O king, just as the hunter on catching sight of a deer experiences joy at the thought: “Him shall I get!” just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, rejoice at the sight of an object for contemplation, and experience joy at the thought: “Thereby shall I grasp the specific idea of which I am in search.” This, O king, is the fourth quality of the hunter he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Mogharāja, the Elder: <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en360' href='#pts-vp-en360'>PTS vp En 360</a> </p>

<p>“The recluse who, with mind on Nirvāṇa bent,<br>
Has acquired an object his thoughts to guide,<br>
Should be filled with exceeding joy at the hope:<br>
’By this my uttermost aim shall I gain.’”’</p>
