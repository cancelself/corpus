<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12' href='#pts-cs12'>PTS cs 12</a> ‘What, Nāgasena, is the distinguishing characteristic of perception (Viññāṇa)?’</p>
<p>‘Recognition, great king.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘It is like the case of the guardian of a city who, when seated at the cross roads in the middle of the city, could see a man coming from the East, or the South, or the West, or the North. In the same way, O king, he knows an object which he sees with his eye, or a sound which he hears with his ear, or an odour which he smells by his nose, or a taste which he experiences with his tongue, or a touchable thing which he touches with his body, or a quality that he recognises by his mind. Thus is it, great king, that knowing is the mark of perception.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
