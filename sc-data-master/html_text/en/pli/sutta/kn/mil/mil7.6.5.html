<h1>7.6.5. The Owl</h1>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14' href='#pts-cs14'>PTS cs 14</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the owl you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the owl, being at enmity with the crows, goes at night where the flocks of crows are, and kills numbers of them; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en345' href='#pts-vp-en345'>PTS vp En 345</a> at enmity with ignorance; seated alone and in secret, he should crush it out of existence, cut it off at the root. This, O king, is the first quality of the owl he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15' href='#pts-cs15'>PTS cs 15</a> ‘And again, O king, as the owl is a solitary bird; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, be devoted to solitude, take delight in solitude. This, O king, is the second quality of the owl he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the most excellent Saṁyutta Nikāya:</p>
<p>“Let the Bhikshu, my brethren, be devoted to solitude, take delight in solitude, to the end that he may realise what sorrow really is, and what the origin of sorrow really is, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli404' href='#pts-vp-pli404'>PTS vp Pali 404</a> and what the cessation of sorrow really is, and what the path that leads to the cessation of sorrow really is.”’</p>
