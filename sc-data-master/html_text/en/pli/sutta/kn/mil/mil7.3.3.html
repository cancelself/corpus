<p>‘Just, O king, as seed, tiny though it be, yet if sown in good soil, and if the god rains aright, will give abundant fruit; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, so conduct himself aright that the righteousness of his life may give abundantly of the fruits of Samanaship. This, O king, is the first quality of seed which he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6' href='#pts-cs6'>PTS cs 6</a> ‘And again, O king, as seed planted in well-weeded soil comes quickly to maturity; just so, O king, will his mind, when well-mastered, and well-purified in solitude, if it be cast by the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, into the excellent field of self-possession, come quickly to maturity. This, O king, is the second quality of seed which he ought to have. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli376' href='#pts-vp-pli376'>PTS vp Pali 376</a> For it was said, O king, by Anuruddha, the Elder:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“If seed be sown on a well-weeded field,<br>
Its fruit, abounding, will rejoice the sower.<br>
So the recluse’s heart, in solitude made pure,<br>
Matures full fast in self-possession’s field.”’</p>
