<h1>7.2.10. The Monkey</h1>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21' href='#pts-cs21'>PTS cs 21</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, those two qualities of the monkey which you say he ought to have, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the monkey, when about to take up his abode does so in some such place as a mighty tree, in a lonely place covered all over with branches, a sure place of refuge; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, choose as the teacher under whom to live a man modest, amiable, righteous, of beauty of character, learned in tradition and in the scriptures, lovable, venerable, worthy of <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en293' href='#pts-vp-en293'>PTS vp En 293</a> reverence, a speaker of profitable things, meek, clever in admonition, in instruction, and in education, able to arouse, to incite, to gladden —such a friend should he choose as teacher. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the monkey he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22' href='#pts-cs22'>PTS cs 22</a> ‘And again, O king, as the monkey wanders about, and stands and sits, always on trees, and, if he goes to sleep, spends the night on them; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, stand and walk up and down thinking, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli374' href='#pts-vp-pli374'>PTS vp Pali 374</a> and lie down, and sleep, in the forest, and there enjoy the sense of self-possession. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the monkey he ought to have. For it has been said, O king, by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Walking, or standing, sitting, lying down,<br>
’Tis in the forest that the Bhikshu shines.<br>
To dwell in wildernesses far remote<br>
Has been exalted by the Buddhas all.”’</p>
