<h1>7.6.2. The Cakravāka Bird</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8' href='#pts-cs8'>PTS cs 8</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, those three qualities of the cakravāka bird you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the cakravāka bird never forsakes his mate even to the close of his life; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, never, even <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en341' href='#pts-vp-en341'>PTS vp En 341</a> to the close of his life, give up the habit of thought. This, O king, is the first quality of the cakravāka bird he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9' href='#pts-cs9'>PTS cs 9</a> ‘And again, O king, as the cakravāka bird feeds on the Sevāla and Paṇaka (water-plants so called), and derives satisfaction therefrom, and being so satisfied, neither his strength nor his beauty grows less; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, find satisfaction in whatever he receives. And if he does so find satisfaction, O king, then does he decrease neither in power of meditation, nor in wisdom, nor in emancipation, nor in the insight that arises from the consciousness of emancipation, nor in any kind of goodness. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli402' href='#pts-vp-pli402'>PTS vp Pali 402</a> This, O king, is the second quality of the cakravāka bird he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10' href='#pts-cs10'>PTS cs 10</a> ‘And again, O king, as the cakravāka bird does no harm to living things; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, laying aside the cudgel, laying aside the sword, be full of modesty and pity, compassionate and kind to all creatures that have life. This, O king, is the third quality of the cakravāka bird he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods, in the cakravāka Jātaka:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The man who kills not, nor destroys,<br>
Oppresses not, nor causes other men<br>
To take from men that which is rightly theirs —- <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en342' href='#pts-vp-en342'>PTS vp En 342</a> <br>
And this from kindness to all things that live—<br>
No wrath with any man disturbs his peace.”’</p>
