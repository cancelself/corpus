<h1>3.4.9. Not all receive Nibbāna</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7' href='#pts-cs7'>PTS cs 7</a> The king said: ‘Venerable Nāgasena, do all men receive Nirvāna?’</p>
<p>‘Not all, O king. But he who walks righteously, who admits those conditions which ought to be admitted, perceives clearly those conditions which ought to be clearly perceived, abandons those conditions which ought to be abandoned, practises himself in those conditions which ought to be practised, realises those conditions which ought to be realised—he receives Nirvāṇa.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’ <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en108' href='#pts-vp-en108'>PTS vp En 108</a> </p>
