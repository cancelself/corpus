<h1>3.2.4. Feelings of one who is not to be reborn</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4' href='#pts-cs4'>PTS cs 4</a> The king said: ‘He who will not be reborn, Nāgasena, does he still feel any painful sensation?’</p>
<p>The Elder replied: ‘Some he feels and some not.’</p>
<p>‘Which are they?’</p>
<p>‘He may feel bodily pain, O king; but mental pain he would not.’</p>
<p>‘How would that be so?’</p>
<p>‘Because the causes, proximate or remote, of bodily pain still continue, he would be liable to it. But the causes, proximate or remote, of mental agony having ceased, he could not feel it. For it has been said by the Blessed One: “One kind of pain he suffers, bodily pain: but not mental.”’</p>
<p>‘Then why, Sir, does he not die?’</p>
<p>‘The Arahat, O king, has need neither to curry <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en70' href='#pts-vp-en70'>PTS vp En 70</a> favour nor to bear malice. He shakes not down the unripe fruit, but awaits the full time of its maturity. For it has been said, O king, by the Elder, Sāriputta, the Commander of the faith <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli45' href='#pts-vp-pli45'>PTS vp Pali 45</a> :</p>

<p>“It is not death, it is not life I welcome;<br>
As the hireling his wage, so do I bide my time.<br>
It is not death, it is not life I want;<br>
Mindful and thoughtful do I bide my time.”’</p>

<p>‘Well put, Nāgasena!’</p>
