<p>‘Yes, Sir, it is.’</p>
<p>‘But be careful, O king.’</p>
<p>‘Well then, Sir, is it perceptible by the tongue?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, that is right.’</p>
<p>‘But, Sir, is it only by the tongue that every kind of salt is distinguished?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, every kind.’</p>
<p>‘If that be so, Sir, why do bullocks bring whole cart-loads of it? Is it not salt and nothing else that ought to be so brought?’</p>
<p>‘It is impossible to bring salt by itself. But all these conditions have run together into one, and produced the distinctive thing called salt. (For instance): salt is heavy, too. But is it possible, O king, to weigh salt?’ <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en99' href='#pts-vp-en99'>PTS vp En 99</a> </p>
<p>‘Certainly, Sir.’</p>
<p>Nay, great king, it is not the salt you weigh, it is the weight.’</p>
<p>‘You are ready, Nāgasena, in argument.’</p>
<p class='endsutta'>Here ends the questioning of Nāgasena by Milinda.</p>
