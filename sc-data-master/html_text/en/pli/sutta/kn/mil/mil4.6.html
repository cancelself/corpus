<h1>4.6. Qualities of a lay disciple</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9' href='#pts-cs9'>PTS cs 9</a> Then the Elder agreed to what he had said, and in his turn set out the ten good qualities which ought to be found in a lay disciple: ‘These ten, O king, are the virtues of a lay disciple. He suffers like pain and feels like joy as the Order does. He takes the Doctrine (Dhamma) as his master. He delights in giving so far as he is able to give. On seeing the religion (Dhamma) of the Conqueror decay, he does his best to revive it. He holds right views. Having no passion for excitement, he runs <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en144' href='#pts-vp-en144'>PTS vp En 144</a> not after any other teacher his life long. He keeps guard over himself in thought and deed. He delights in peace, is a lover of peace. He feels no jealousy, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli95' href='#pts-vp-pli95'>PTS vp Pali 95</a> and walks not in religion in a quarrelsome spirit. He takes his refuge in the Buddha, he takes his refuge in the Doctrine, he takes his refuge in the Order. These, great king, are the ten good qualities of a lay disciple. They exist all of them in you. Hence is it fit, and right, and becoming in you that, seeing the decay of the religion of the Conqueror, you desire its prosperity. I give you leave. Ask of me whatever you will.’</p>
