<p>‘By various actions, not by one.’</p>
<p>‘Give me an illustration.’</p>
<p>‘Now, what do you think, O king? If I were to sow in one field five kinds of seed, would the produce of those various seeds be of different kinds?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, certainly.’</p>
<p>‘Well, just so with respect to the production of āyatanas.’</p>
<p>‘Very good, Nāgasena!’</p>
