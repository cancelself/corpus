<h1>7.5.8. The Bull</h1>

<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en333' href='#pts-vp-en333'>PTS vp En 333</a> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12' href='#pts-cs12'>PTS cs 12</a> ‘Venerable Nāgasena, those four qualities of the bull you say he ought to take, which are they?’</p>
<p>‘Just, O king, as the bull never forsakes its own stall; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, never abandon his own body on the ground that its nature is only the decomposition, the wearing away, the dissolution, the destruction of that which is impermanent. This, O king, is the first quality of the bull he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13' href='#pts-cs13'>PTS cs 13</a> ‘And again, O king, as the bull, when he has once taken the yoke upon him, bears that yoke through all conditions of case or of pain; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli397' href='#pts-vp-pli397'>PTS vp Pali 397</a> when he has once taken upon himself the life of a recluse, keep to it, in happiness or in woe, to the end of his life, to his latest breath. This, O king, is the second quality of the bull he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14' href='#pts-cs14'>PTS cs 14</a> ‘And again, O king, as the bull drinks water with never satiated desire; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, receive the instruction of his teachers and masters with a desire, love, and pleasure that is never satiated. This, O king, is the third quality of the bull he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15' href='#pts-cs15'>PTS cs 15</a> ‘And again, O king, as the bull equally bears the yoke whoever puts it on him; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, accept with bowed head the admonitions and exhortations <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en334' href='#pts-vp-en334'>PTS vp En 334</a> of the elders, of the brethren of junior or of middle standing, and of the believing laity alike. This, O king, is the fourth quality of the bull he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by Sāriputta, the Elder, the Commander of the Faith:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“A novice, seven years of age, a boy<br>
Only to-day received into our ranks,<br>
He too may teach me, and with bended head,<br>
His admonitions will I gladly bear.<br>
Time after time, where’er I meet him, still<br>
My strong approval, and my love, will I<br>
Lavish upon him—if he be but good—<br>
And yield the honoured place of teacher to him.”’</p>
