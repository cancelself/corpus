<p><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli375' href='#pts-vp-pli375'>PTS vp Pali 375</a> ‘Just, O king, as the lotus, though it is born in the water, and grows up in the water, yet remains undefiled by the water (for no water adheres to it); just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain undefiled by the support that he receives, or by the following of disciples that he obtains, or by fame, or by honour, or by veneration, or by the abundance of the requisites that he enjoys. This, O king, is the first of the qualities of the lotus that he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3' href='#pts-cs3'>PTS cs 3</a> ‘And again, O king, as the lotus remains lifted up far above the water; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, remain far above all worldly things. This, O king, is the second of the qualities of the lotus that he ought to have.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4' href='#pts-cs4'>PTS cs 4</a> ‘And again, O king, as the lotus trembles when blown upon by the slightest breeze; just so, O king, should the strenuous Bhikshu, earnest in effort, exercise self-control in respect of the least of the evil dispositions, perceiving the danger (in the least offence). This, O king, is the third of the qualities of the lotus he ought to have. For it was said, O king, by the Blessed One, the god over all gods:</p>
<p>“Seeing danger in the least offence, he takes upon himself, trains himself in, the precepts.”’</p>
