<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2949' href='#jw2949'>Walt 2949</a> In the city, Haṁsavatī,<br>
I was a grass-bearer <span class='add'>back then</span>.<br>
I am living by bearing grass,<br>
and by that I feed <span class='add'>my</span> children.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2950' href='#jw2950'>Walt 2950</a> The Victor, Padumuttara,<br>
was the Master of Everything.<br>
Doing away with the darkness,<br>
the World-Leader arose back then.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2951-2952' href='#jw2951-2952'>Walt 2951-2952</a> <span class='add'>While</span> sitting down in <span class='add'>my</span> own house,<br>
this is what I thought at that time:<br>
“The Buddha’s risen in the world,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> I lack anything to give.<br>
I <span class='add'>only</span> have this single cloak,<br>
I do not have <span class='add'>my own</span> donor.<br>
Suffering is a taste of hell;<br>
I will <span class='add'>now</span> plant a donation.”</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2953' href='#jw2953'>Walt 2953</a> Contemplating <span class='add'>it</span> in this way,<br>
I brought pleasure to <span class='add'>my</span> own heart.<br>
Taking that single piece of cloth,<br>
I gave <span class='add'>it</span> to the Best Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2954' href='#jw2954'>Walt 2954</a> Having given <span class='add'>that</span> single cloth,<br>
I gave rise to <span class='add'>great</span> shouts of joy,<br>
“If you are a Buddha, Wise One,<br>
carry me across, O Great Sage.”</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2955' href='#jw2955'>Walt 2955</a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
singing the praises of my gift,<br>
<span class='add'>the Buddha</span> then gave thanks to me:</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2956' href='#jw2956'>Walt 2956</a> “Because of this single cloak<span class='add'>-gift,</span><br>
<span class='add'>done</span> with intention and resolve,<br>
he will not go to a bad place<br>
for one hundred thousand aeons.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2957' href='#jw2957'>Walt 2957</a> Thirty-six times a lord of gods,<br>
he will exercise divine rule.<br>
And thirty-three times he’ll become<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2958' href='#jw2958'>Walt 2958</a> There will be much regional rule,<br>
incalculable by counting.<br>
In the world of gods or of men,<br>
you’ll transmigrate in existence.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2959' href='#jw2959'>Walt 2959</a> Good-looking and full of virtue,<br>
with a body that’s not surpassed,<br>
you’ll obtain, whenever you wish,<br>
unwavering limitless cloth.”</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2960' href='#jw2960'>Walt 2960</a> When he had said this, the Buddha<br>
known by the name Supreme Lotus,<br>
the Wise One rose into the sky,<br>
just like a swan-king in the air.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2961' href='#jw2961'>Walt 2961</a> In whichever womb I’m reborn,<br>
<span class='add'>whether</span> it’s human or divine,<br>
I have no lack of possessions:<br>
that’s the fruit of a single cloth.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2962' href='#jw2962'>Walt 2962</a> With every footstep <span class='add'>that I take</span>,<br>
<span class='add'>some</span> cloth is <span class='add'>then</span> produced for me.<br>
I stand upon cloth underneath;<br>
a canopy on top of me.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2963' href='#jw2963'>Walt 2963</a> <span class='add'>And</span> today I <span class='add'>still</span> am wishing<br>
that I could cover with <span class='add'>some</span> cloth<br>
even the <span class='add'>whole</span> universe<br>
with <span class='add'>its</span> forests <span class='add'>and its</span> mountains.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2964' href='#jw2964'>Walt 2964</a> Just because of that single cloth,<br>
transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>
I was one of golden color,<br>
transmigrating from birth to birth.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2965' href='#jw2965'>Walt 2965</a> <span class='add'>One</span> result of that single cloth:<br>
no ruination anywhere.<br>
This one <span class='add'>will be my</span> final life;<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> now is bearing fruit for me.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2966' href='#jw2966'>Walt 2966</a> In the hundred thousand aeons<br>
since I gave that cloth at that time,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:<br>
that’s the fruit of a single cloth.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2967' href='#jw2967'>Walt 2967</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2968' href='#jw2968'>Walt 2968</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught!</p>
