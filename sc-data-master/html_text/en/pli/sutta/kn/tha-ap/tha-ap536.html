a hundred thousand aeons hence. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1' href='#vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5771' href='#jw5771'>Walt 5771</a> Merciful, Compassionate One,<br>
Well-Wisher of all that breathe, he<br>
established in the five precepts<br>
all the rivals who had arrived. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3' href='#vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5772' href='#jw5772'>Walt 5772</a> In this way he was Unconfused<br>
and Very Well-Known by rivals,<br>
Ornamented by arahants<br>
who were masters <span class='add'>and</span> neutral ones. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4' href='#vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5773' href='#jw5773'>Walt 5773</a> The <span class='add'>body of the</span> Sage So Great<br>
rose up fifty-eight cubits <span class='add'>tall</span>;<br>
he was Valuable Like Gold,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5' href='#vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5774' href='#jw5774'>Walt 5774</a> <span class='add'>People’s</span> lifespan at that time was<br>
<span class='add'>fully</span> one hundred thousand years.<br>
Remaining <span class='add'>in the world</span> so long,<br>
he ferried many folks across. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6' href='#vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5775' href='#jw5775'>Walt 5775</a> I was then a millionaire’s son<br>
in Haṁsavatī, of great fame.<br>
Approaching the Lamp of the World,<br>
I heard the preaching of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7' href='#vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5776' href='#jw5776'>Walt 5776</a> I was happy after hearing<br>
the words of <span class='add'>the Buddha</span> praising<br>
his follower, the <span class='add'>monk who was</span><br>
appointing lodgings for the monks. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8' href='#vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5777' href='#jw5777'>Walt 5777</a> <span class='add'>My</span> head bowed at the feet of the<br>
Great Sage, I aspired to attain<br>
that place, <span class='add'>foremost</span> among those who<br>
do the Assembly's management. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9' href='#vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5778' href='#jw5778'>Walt 5778</a> At that time the Great Hero spoke;<br>
he praised my karma <span class='add'>in this way</span>:<br>
“Who fed the Leader of the World,<br>
with the Assembly, for a week, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10' href='#vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5779' href='#jw5779'>Walt 5779</a> whose eyes are <span class='add'>just like</span> lotus leaves,<br>
lion-shouldered, with golden skin;<br>
fallen down in front of my feet,<br>
he has wished for that <span class='add'>foremost</span> place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11' href='#vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5780' href='#jw5780'>Walt 5780</a> In one hundred thousand aeons,<br>
arising in Okkāka’s clan,<br>
the one whose name is Gotama<br>
will be the Teacher in the world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12' href='#vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5781' href='#jw5781'>Walt 5781</a> That Buddha’s follower <span class='add'>will be</span><br>
well-known by the name of Dabba.<br>
This one is going to be the top<br>
assigner of the lodgings then.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13' href='#vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5782' href='#jw5782'>Walt 5782</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>
discarding <span class='add'>my</span> human body,<br>
I went to Tāvatiṁsa <span class='add'>then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14' href='#vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5783' href='#jw5783'>Walt 5783</a> Three hundred times <span class='add'>the lord of gods,</span><br>
I exercised divine rule <span class='add'>there</span>,<br>
and <span class='add'>then</span> five hundred times I was<br>
a king who turns the wheel <span class='add'>of law</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15' href='#vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5784' href='#jw5784'>Walt 5784</a> <span class='add'>There was also</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting.<br>
Through the power of that karma,<br>
I was happy in every place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16' href='#vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5785' href='#jw5785'>Walt 5785</a> The Leader known as Vipassi,<br>
with Insight into Everything,<br>
Charming-Eyed One, arose in the<br>
world, ninety-one aeons ago. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17' href='#vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5786' href='#jw5786'>Walt 5786</a> Evil-minded, I reproached a<br>
follower of that Neutral One<br>
who had destroyed all defilements,<br>
despite having known, “he is pure.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18' href='#vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5787' href='#jw5787'>Walt 5787</a> Having provided meal-tickets,<br>
I offered rice <span class='add'>well-cooked</span> in milk<br>
to great sages, the followers<br>
of that very Hero of Men. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19' href='#vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5788' href='#jw5788'>Walt 5788</a> During this auspicious aeon<br>
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,<br>
named Kassapa through <span class='add'>his</span> lineage,<br>
Best Debater, <span class='add'>Buddha,</span> arose. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20' href='#vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5789' href='#jw5789'>Walt 5789</a> Lighting up the dispensation,<br>
overcoming evil rivals,<br>
instructing the instruct-able, he<br>
reached nirvana, with followers. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21' href='#vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5790' href='#jw5790'>Walt 5790</a> Hair-loosened, teary-faced, the gods,<br>
were moved <span class='add'>and</span> they wept when the Lord<br>
and students reached nirvana, <span class='add'>his</span><br>
dispensation reaching <span class='add'>its</span> goal: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22' href='#vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5791' href='#jw5791'>Walt 5791</a> “Alas! We have little merit.<br>
The <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-Eye passes away.<br>
We’ll not see the compliant ones,<br>
we will not hear the great Teaching.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23' href='#vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5792' href='#jw5792'>Walt 5792</a> <span class='add'>Just</span> then the whole of this <span class='add'>great</span> earth,<br>
which is unshaking, shook with shakes,<br>
and the ocean, as though in grief,<br>
was crying a piteous song. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24' href='#vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5793' href='#jw5793'>Walt 5793</a> <span class='add'>And</span> drums in <span class='add'>all</span> four directions,<br>
were played by non-human beings;<br>
lightening burst out from everywhere,<br>
frightening <span class='add'>beings who were there</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25' href='#vjw25'>Verse 25</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5794' href='#jw5794'>Walt 5794</a> Meteors fell down from the sky,<br>
and he whose flag is smoke was seen.<br>
The wild beasts roared piteously,<br>
and all the creatures born on earth. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26' href='#vjw26'>Verse 26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5795' href='#jw5795'>Walt 5795</a> Seeing fierce omens marking the<br>
setting of the dispensation,<br>
moved, we monks who <span class='add'>still remained</span> there,<br>
then thought <span class='add'>about it in this way</span>: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27' href='#vjw27'>Verse 27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5796' href='#jw5796'>Walt 5796</a> “<span class='add'>Now</span>, without our dispensation,<br>
enough with life <span class='add'>itself for us</span>.<br>
Entering the forest we’ll strive<br>
in the Victor’s dispensation.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw28' href='#vjw28'>Verse 28</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5797' href='#jw5797'>Walt 5797</a> We saw a tall, superb mountain<br>
<span class='add'>there</span> in the forest at that time.<br>
Ascending by a flight of stairs,<br>
we fell down on the flight of stairs. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29' href='#vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5798-5799' href='#jw5798-5799'>Walt 5798-5799</a> Then an elder admonished us:<br>
“A Buddha’s rising’s hard to get;<br>
well-got for you is getting faith,<br>
the dispensation’s small remnant.<br>
Fallen down they’re missing <span class='add'>their</span> chance,<br>
in the endless suffering-sea.<br>
Therefore strong effort should be made<br>
while the Sage’s thought remains.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw30-31' href='#vjw30-31'>Verse 30-31</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5800' href='#jw5800'>Walt 5800</a> That elder was an arahant,<br>
a non-returner followed him.<br>
Fixed in good morality, the<br>
rest <span class='add'>of us</span> went to the gods’ world. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw32' href='#vjw32'>Verse 32</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5801-5802' href='#jw5801-5802'>Walt 5801-5802</a> In the pure abode that one <span class='add'>monk</span><br>
reached nirvana, crossed existence;<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> I and Pukkusāti <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
Sabhiya, likewise Bāhiya,<br>
so too Kumāra-Kassapa,<br>
reborn here and there we are <span class='add'>now</span><br>
freed from the bonds of existence,<br>
pitied by Gotama <span class='add'>Buddha</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw33-34' href='#vjw33-34'>Verse 33-34</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5803' href='#jw5803'>Walt 5803</a> Born a Kusināran Malla,<br>
even in the womb I’m conscious.<br>
Dead mother raised up on a pyre;<br>
I was <span class='add'>one who</span> fell out from that. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw35' href='#vjw35'>Verse 35</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5804' href='#jw5804'>Walt 5804</a> I landed on a pile of wood;<br>
therefore I was known as “Dabba.”<br>
Through the strength of holy living,<br>
I was freed, <span class='add'>just</span> seven years old. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw36' href='#vjw36'>Verse 36</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5805' href='#jw5805'>Walt 5805</a> Due to the fruit of the milk-rice,<br>
I’m endowed with the five fine traits;<br>
due to reproaching the pure monk,<br>
I was urged by many bad folks. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw37' href='#vjw37'>Verse 37</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5806' href='#jw5806'>Walt 5806</a> Now I am one who’s passed beyond<br>
both merit and evil <span class='add'>karma</span>.<br>
Attaining supreme peacefulness,<br>
I am <span class='add'>now</span> living, undefiled. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw38' href='#vjw38'>Verse 38</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5807' href='#jw5807'>Walt 5807</a> Making the compliant ones laugh,<br>
I appointed lodgings <span class='add'>for them</span>.<br>
The Victor, pleased by that virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> placed me in that foremost place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw39' href='#vjw39'>Verse 39</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5808' href='#jw5808'>Walt 5808</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw40' href='#vjw40'>Verse 40</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5809' href='#jw5809'>Walt 5809</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
