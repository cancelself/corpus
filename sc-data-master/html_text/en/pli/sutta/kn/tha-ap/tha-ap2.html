<p>Now listen to the legend of the Lonely Buddhas:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw82' href='#jw82'>Walt 82</a> The Sage of Vedeha, his body bent, asked<br>
the Thus-Gone-One dwelling in Jetavana,<br>
“Indeed there are those <span class='add'>called</span> the Lonely Buddhas;<br>
through what causes do they become <span class='add'>so</span>, Wise One?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1' href='#vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw83' href='#jw83'>Walt 83</a> Then spoke the Omniscient, Outstanding, Great Sage,<br>
to lucky Ānanda with <span class='add'>his</span> honeyed voice,<br>
“Who performed service among former Buddhas,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> didn’t get freed in their dispensations, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2' href='#vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw84' href='#jw84'>Walt 84</a> because that is the means to awaken, wise,<br>
they with sharp knowing, through knowledge and power,<br>
because of <span class='add'>their</span> wishes <span class='add'>and</span> also great strength,<br>
reach the Awakening of Lonely <span class='add'>Buddhas</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3' href='#vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw85' href='#jw85'>Walt 85</a> In every world, with the exception of me,<br>
there is no equal for the Lonely Buddhas.<br>
I will describe a piece of the excellent<br>
character of those Buddhas, the Great Sages.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4' href='#vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw86' href='#jw86'>Walt 86</a> All of you, with well-pleased minds, aspiring for<br>
the unsurpassed medicine, hear, by yourselves,<br>
the excellent sayings, which are short and sweet,<br>
of those Great Sages who were Lonely Buddhas, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5' href='#vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw87' href='#jw87'>Walt 87</a> which are explanations of generations<br>
of Lonely Buddhas who gathered together,<br>
and a story of dispassion for danger,<br>
and likewise <span class='add'>how</span> they achieved Awakening. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6' href='#vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw88' href='#jw88'>Walt 88</a> With awareness detached from passionate things,<br>
mind not delighting in delights in the world,<br>
abandoning obstacles, throbbing conquered,<br>
thereby indeed they achieved Awakening. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7' href='#vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw89' href='#jw89'>Walt 89</a> Putting away the stick among all beings,<br>
not causing harm to a single one of them,<br>
with a loving mind, friendly, compassionate,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8' href='#vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw90' href='#jw90'>Walt 90</a> Putting away the stick among all beings,<br>
not causing harm to a single one of them,<br>
not wishing for sons, let alone companions,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9' href='#vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw91' href='#jw91'>Walt 91</a> Affections arise for one with connections;<br>
this dis-ease proceeds in line with affections.<br>
Seeing the danger that’s born of affections,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10' href='#vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw92' href='#jw92'>Walt 92</a> Feeling compassion for friends <span class='add'>and</span> companions,<br>
one puts off the goal, mind tied <span class='add'>to their problems</span>;<br>
seeing that fearfulness in intimacy,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11' href='#vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw93' href='#jw93'>Walt 93</a> One who is attentive to sons and to wives<br>
is entangled like a large bamboo <span class='add'>thicket</span>.<br>
Not stuck to others, like a new bamboo shoot,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12' href='#vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw94' href='#jw94'>Walt 94</a> Just as a deer, not ensnared, goes for pasture<br>
in the forest according to <span class='add'>its</span> wishes,<br>
a knowing man looks after independence;<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13' href='#vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw95' href='#jw95'>Walt 95</a> Resting, standing, going, wandering there is<br>
<span class='add'>some</span> invitation amidst <span class='add'>one’s</span> companions.<br>
Looking after independence <span class='add'>most</span> don’t want,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14' href='#vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw96' href='#jw96'>Walt 96</a> Amidst <span class='add'>one’s</span> companions there is delighting<br>
in sports, and there is abundant love for sons.<br>
<span class='add'>Though</span> hating separation from what’s held dear,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15' href='#vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw97' href='#jw97'>Walt 97</a> Global in outlook, one is causing no harm,<br>
being happy with whatever comes one’s way;<br>
an endurer of troubles, not stiff with fear,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16' href='#vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw98' href='#jw98'>Walt 98</a> Even some who have gone forth are ill-disposed;<br>
likewise <span class='add'>some</span> householders living in the house.<br>
Being unconcerned about others’ children,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17' href='#vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw99' href='#jw99'>Walt 99</a> Shedding the attributes of life in the house<br>
like an ebony tree whose leaves have fallen,<br>
the hero severs the ties to household life;<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw100' href='#jw100'>Walt 100</a> If one should obtain a clever companion,<br>
a co-wanderer who lives well <span class='add'>and</span> is wise,<br>
after having overcome every trouble,<br>
one would wander with that one, thrilled <span class='add'>and</span> mindful. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19' href='#vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw101' href='#jw101'>Walt 101</a> If one should not get a clever companion,<br>
a co-wanderer who lives well <span class='add'>and</span> is wise,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> like a king quitting a conquered kingdom,<br>
one should wander alone, like tuskers in the woods. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20' href='#vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw102' href='#jw102'>Walt 102</a> Truly we’re praising success with companions;<br>
those who are better or equal should be served.<br>
Not getting those, not enjoying sinful things,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21' href='#vjw21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw103' href='#jw103'>Walt 103</a> Seeing shiny <span class='add'>bangles made out</span> of <span class='add'>fine</span> gold,<br>
which have been well-made by the son of a smith,\<br>
banging together when two are on <span class='add'>one</span> arm<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22' href='#vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw104' href='#jw104'>Walt 104</a> “Like that, with another, there will be for me,<br>
meaningless chatter or ill-tempered <span class='add'>bad speech</span>;”<br>
seeing that as a danger for the future,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23' href='#vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw105' href='#jw105'>Walt 105</a> Sense pleasures are varied, sweet and delightful;<br>
<span class='add'>they</span> churn up the mind with <span class='add'>their</span> varying form.<br>
Seeing danger in the strands of sense pleasure,<br>
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw24' href='#vjw24'>Verse 24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw106' href='#jw106'>Walt 106</a> “For me this is calamity, misfortune;<br>
a sickness, a <span class='add'>sharp</span> arrow, a fearsome thing.”<br>
Seeing this fear in the strands of sense pleasure,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw108' href='#jw108'>Walt 108</a> Just as a noble elephant with a full-<br>

lacking hypocrisy, fault- and folly-free,<br>
becoming intention-free in the whole world,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw113' href='#jw113'>Walt 113</a> One should consort with <span class='add'>someone</span> noble, a friend,<br>
