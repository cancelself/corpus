<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5839' href='#jw5839'>Walt 5839</a> One hundred thousand aeons hence<br>
the Leader arose <span class='add'>in the world</span>,<br>
the Great Light, Chief of the Three Worlds,<br>
who name was Padumuttara. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1' href='#vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5840-5841' href='#jw5840-5841'>Walt 5840-5841</a> My mind thrilled, having heard the Sage,<br>
praising the virtue of a monk<br>
who had instant comprehension;<br>
doing a deed for the Great Sage,<br>
having given alms for a week<br>
to the Sage with <span class='add'>his</span> students, I<br>
saluting <span class='add'>him</span>, the Sambuddha,<br>
then aspired <span class='add'>to attain</span> that place. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2-3' href='#vjw2-3'>Verse 2-3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5842-5845' href='#jw5842-5845'>Walt 5842-5845</a> The Buddha prophesied <span class='add'>of</span> me:<br>
“All of you look at this brahmin,<br>
fallen down in front of my feet,<br>
broad-shouldered, contemplating <span class='add'>me</span>,<br>
gold brahmin’s cord on <span class='add'>his</span> torso,<br>
skin that’s white upon his body,<br>
who has pouty, copper-red lips,<br>
teeth that are white, sharp and even,<br>
with the utmost strength of virtue,<br>
<span class='add'>his</span> body hair growing upward,<br>
with senses flooded by virtue,<br>
with a face blossoming in joy,<br>
wishing for the place of the monk<br>
who has instant comprehension.<br>
In the future, a Great Hero<br>
will come to be, named Gotama. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4-7' href='#vjw4-7'>Verse 4-7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5846' href='#jw5846'>Walt 5846</a>Worthy heir to that one’s <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>,<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>’s legitimate offspring,<br>
the one whose name is Bāhiya<br>
will be the Teacher’s follower.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8' href='#vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5847' href='#jw5847'>Walt 5847</a> Then very happy, being roused,<br>
for as long as <span class='add'>I</span> lived, doing<br>
deeds for the Sage, fallen, I went<br>
to heaven, as though my own home. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9' href='#vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5848' href='#jw5848'>Walt 5848</a> Born as a god or as a man,<br>
because of the power of that<br>
karma, transmigrating I <span class='add'>then</span><br>
enjoyed good fortune <span class='add'>everywhere</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10' href='#vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5849' href='#jw5849'>Walt 5849</a> Again, when Hero Kassapa’s<br>
dispensation had reached <span class='add'>its</span> goal,<br>
ascending to a mountain-top,<br>
engaged in the Victor’s teachings, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11' href='#vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5850' href='#jw5850'>Walt 5850</a> of pure morals, wise, doers<br>
of the Victor’s dispensation,<br>
fallen from there, <span class='add'>we</span> five people,<br>
<span class='add'>then</span> went to the world of the gods. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12' href='#vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5851' href='#jw5851'>Walt 5851</a> Then I was born as Bāhiya,<br>
in Bhārukaccha, best city.<br>
From there by boat I venture forth<br>
on the ocean full of danger. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13' href='#vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5852' href='#jw5852'>Walt 5852</a> After going for a few days<br>
from there, the boat was broken up;<br>
then I fell into <span class='add'>the ocean</span>,<br>
awful, fearful, sea-monster-mine. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14' href='#vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5853' href='#jw5853'>Walt 5853</a> At that time, after <span class='add'>much</span> struggling,<br>
having crossed over the ocean,<br>
disoriented, I arrived<br>
at the good seaport Suppāra. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15' href='#vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5854-5855' href='#jw5854-5855'>Walt 5854-5855</a> Having dressed in robes made of bark,<br>
I entered the village for alms.<br>
Then a man <span class='add'>there</span>, delighted, said,<br>
“This is an arahant who’s come;<br>
honoring him with food <span class='add'>and</span> drink,<br>
with clothes and <span class='add'>also</span> with a bed,<br>
and <span class='add'>furthermore</span> with medicine,<br>
we’ll be happy <span class='add'>through that karma</span>.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16-17' href='#vjw16-17'>Verse 16-17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5856' href='#jw5856'>Walt 5856</a> Receiving <span class='add'>that</span>, then going back,<br>
<span class='add'>thus</span> honored and worshipped by them,<br>
wrongly I gave rise to the thought<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> “this one is an arahant.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18' href='#vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5857' href='#jw5857'>Walt 5857</a> Afterward, discerning my mind,<br>
the non-returner god reproached:<br>
“You don’t know the path, the method;<br>
how could you be an arahant?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19' href='#vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5858' href='#jw5858'>Walt 5858</a> Reproached by him I was then moved;<br>
I questioned him back <span class='add'>in this way</span>:<br>
“Who, or where in the world are they,<br>
<span class='add'>those</span> supreme men, the arahants?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw20' href='#vjw20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5859' href='#jw5859'>Walt 5859</a> “Of Vast Wisdom, Greatly Very Wise, the<br>
Victor, in Śrāvasti, in Kosala’s palace,<br>
the Śākyas’ Son, the Arahant, Undefiled One<br>
is preaching <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> for reaching arahantship.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw21-22' href='#vjw21-22'>Verse 21-22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5860' href='#jw5860'>Walt 5860</a> Then having heard <span class='add'>that</span> word of him <span class='add'>I was</span> well-gladdened,<br>
very astonished like a pauper finding treasure,<br>
mind thrilled <span class='add'>for</span> ultimate arahantship, <span class='add'>and</span> to<br>
know the Good-Looking One, the Limitless Pasture. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23-24' href='#vjw23-24'>Verse 23-24</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5861' href='#jw5861'>Walt 5861</a> Delighting at that time, departing for the Teacher,<br>
always I see the Victor whose Face is Stainless.<br>
Approaching the delightful grove named Vijita,<br>
I questioned brahmins, “Where is the World’s Delighter?” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw25-26' href='#vjw25-26'>Verse 25-26</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5862' href='#jw5862'>Walt 5862</a> Then they replied, “the One Worshipped by Men <span class='add'>and</span> Gods<br>
has entered the city wishing to eat some food;<br>
very quickly indeed, zealous to see the Sage,<br>
approach and worship him, the Foremost of People. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw27-28' href='#vjw27-28'>Verse 27-28</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5863-5864' href='#jw5863-5864'>Walt 5863-5864</a> <span class='add'>And</span> then, having gone speedily<br>
to Śrāvasti, the best city,<br>
I saw the <span class='add'>Buddha</span> wandering<br>
for alms, without greed or desire,<br>
bowl in hand, eyes undistracted,<br>
as though dividing ambrosia,<br>
like the abode of good fortune,<br>
face bearing the blaze of the sun. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29-30' href='#vjw29-30'>Verse 29-30</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5865' href='#jw5865'>Walt 5865</a> Coming together, bowing down,<br>
I <span class='add'>then</span> spoke these words to him <span class='add'>there</span>:<br>
“O Gotama, be the refuge<br>
for one who’s lost on the wrong road.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw31' href='#vjw31'>Verse 31</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5866' href='#jw5866'>Walt 5866</a> The Seventh Sage said this <span class='add'>to me</span>:<br>
“I’m wandering on <span class='add'>my</span> alms-round<br>
to help living beings cross; not<br>
the time to tell you the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw32' href='#vjw32'>Verse 32</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5867' href='#jw5867'>Walt 5867</a> Again <span class='add'>and</span> again I asked the<br>
Buddha, being greedy for <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>.<br>
He then preached the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> to me,<br>
the state that is deep and empty. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw33' href='#vjw33'>Verse 33</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5868' href='#jw5868'>Walt 5868</a> Hearing his Teaching, I attained<br>
the destruction of the outflows,<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> lifespan obliterated.<br>
O! the Teacher’s mercifulness! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw34' href='#vjw34'>Verse 34</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5869' href='#jw5869'>Walt 5869</a> My defilements are <span class='add'>now</span> burnt up;<br>
all <span class='add'>new</span> existence is destroyed.<br>
Like elephants with broken chains,<br>
I am living without constraint. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw35' href='#vjw35'>Verse 35</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5870' href='#jw5870'>Walt 5870</a> Being in Best Buddha’s presence<br>
was a very good thing for me.<br>
The three knowledges are attained;<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw36' href='#vjw36'>Verse 36</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5871' href='#jw5871'>Walt 5871</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw37' href='#vjw37'>Verse 37</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5872' href='#jw5872'>Walt 5872</a> Thus prophesied the elder <span class='add'>named</span><br>
Bāhiya Dārucīriya.<br>
He fell down on a garbage heap<br>
when he had been gored by a cow. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw38' href='#vjw38'>Verse 38</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5873' href='#jw5873'>Walt 5873</a> Having detailed his own former<br>
conduct, he who was very wise,<br>
that hero fully passed away<br>
in Śrāvasti, supreme city. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw39' href='#vjw39'>Verse 39</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5874-5875' href='#jw5874-5875'>Walt 5874-5875</a> <span class='add'>Then</span> departing from the city,<br>
the Seventh Sage, having seen him—<br>
the wise one who wore robes of wood,<br>
outsider come to the outside,<br>
now fallen onto the safe ground,<br>
like the fallen flag of Indra,<br>
lifespan gone, defilements gone, a<br>
doer of the Victor’s teachings—<a class='ref vjw' id='vjw40-41' href='#vjw40-41'>Verse 40-41</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5876' href='#jw5876'>Walt 5876</a> the Teacher said to followers<br>
who delighted in the teachings:<br>
“get, and having taken <span class='add'>it</span> burn,<br>
the body of your fellow monk. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw42' href='#vjw42'>Verse 42</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5877' href='#jw5877'>Walt 5877</a> Build a stupa <span class='add'>and</span> worship it;<br>
this great wise one reached nirvana,<br>
foremost in instant comprehension,<br>
follower who heeded my words. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw43' href='#vjw43'>Verse 43</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5878' href='#jw5878'>Walt 5878</a> One word in a verse, hearing which,<br>
one becomes calm, is better than<br>
even a thousand verses, if<br>
they possess words without meaning. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw44' href='#vjw44'>Verse 44</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5879' href='#jw5879'>Walt 5879</a> Where the waters and the earth, the<br>
fire and the wind have no footing,<br>
there the stars are not shining, <span class='add'>and</span><br>
the sun <span class='add'>remains</span> invisible;<br>
the moon does not shed light there, <span class='add'>and</span><br>
darkness is not to be found there. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw45,.46a-b' href='#vjw45,.46a-b'>Verse 45,.46a-b</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5880' href='#jw5880'>Walt 5880</a> And when one knows <span class='add'>that place</span> oneself,<br>
a sage, a brahmin with wisdom,<br>
he’s freed from form and formlessness,<br>
from happiness and suffering.”<br>
Thus <span class='add'>he</span> spoke, <span class='add'>the Buddha</span>, the Lord,<br>
the Sage, Refuge of the Three Worlds. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw46c-d,.47' href='#vjw46c-d,.47'>Verse 46c-d,.47</a></p>
