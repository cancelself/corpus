<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4567' href='#jw4567'>Walt 4567</a> In the city, Haṁsavatī,<br>
I was a cultivator then.<br>
I <span class='add'>earn my</span> living by farming,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> through it I feed <span class='add'>my</span> children. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1' href='#vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4568' href='#jw4568'>Walt 4568</a> <span class='add'>My</span> field back then was bountiful,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> my grain was producing seed;<br>
when the fruit-bearing time arrived,<br>
I then thought <span class='add'>about it</span> like this: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2' href='#vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4569' href='#jw4569'>Walt 4569</a> “It’s not right, it is not fitting<br>
for one who knows what’s virtuous,<br>
that without giving to the monks,<br>
I should consume the best of this. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3' href='#vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4570' href='#jw4570'>Walt 4570</a> This Buddha’s the Impartial One,<br>
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks;<br>
reared by him, the monks’ Assembly<br>
is the unsurpassed merit-field. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4' href='#vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4571' href='#jw4571'>Walt 4571</a> I shall give a donation there,<br>
the first of each of the new crop.”<br>
Thinking about <span class='add'>it</span> like that, I<br>
was happy, with a gladdened mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5' href='#vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4572' href='#jw4572'>Walt 4572</a> <span class='add'>Then</span> carrying grain from <span class='add'>my</span> field,<br>
I went up to the Sambuddha.<br>
Having approached the Sambuddha,<br>
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> worshipping the Teacher’s feet,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to the Buddha</span>: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6' href='#vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4573' href='#jw4573'>Walt 4573</a> “The new crop <span class='add'>of grain</span> has prospered;<br>
you’re the Recipient of Gifts.<br>
O Sage, showing <span class='add'>me</span> compassion,<br>
please accept it, O Eyeful One.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7' href='#vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4574' href='#jw4574'>Walt 4574</a> Padumuttara, World-Knower,<br>
Sacrificial Recipient,<br>
discerning what I was thinking,<br>
spoke these words <span class='add'>to me at that time</span>: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8' href='#vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4575' href='#jw4575'>Walt 4575</a> “Four have entered <span class='add'>into the path</span>;<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4576' href='#jw4576'>Walt 4576</a> Merit done for the <span class='add'>good</span> rebirths<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4577' href='#jw4577'>Walt 4577</a> The new crop, so too more than that,<br>

What has been prepared in your house,<br>
give that to the monks’ Assembly.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11' href='#vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4579' href='#jw4579'>Walt 4579</a> Due to that karma done very well,<br>
with intention and <span class='add'>firm</span> resolve,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4580' href='#jw4580'>Walt 4580</a> There my well-constructed mansion<br>

<span class='add'>and it</span> was thirty leagues in width. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14' href='#vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4581' href='#jw4581'>Walt 4581</a> The nineteenth recitation portion.<br>

I live among the thirty gods. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw15' href='#vjw15'>Verse 15</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4582' href='#jw4582'>Walt 4582</a> And three times in succession I<br>
exercised divine rule <span class='add'>back then</span>,<br>
and five times in succession I<br>
was a monarch who turns the wheel,<br>
<span class='add'>and I enjoyed</span> much local rule,<br>
innumerable by counting. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw16' href='#vjw16'>Verse 16</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4583' href='#jw4583'>Walt 4583</a> Transmigrating from birth to birth,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4591' href='#jw4591'>Walt 4591</a> After donating <span class='add'>my</span> new crop,<br>

I experience eight results,<br>

They all are giving me respect,<br>
whomever on earth I mix with.<br>
And whatever gifts there <span class='add'>may</span> be,<br>
I <span class='add'>always</span> get the first of each. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw26-27' href='#vjw26-27'>Verse 26-27</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4594' href='#jw4594'>Walt 4594</a> In the middle of the monks or<br>
