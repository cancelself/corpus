<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw674' href='#jw674'>Walt 674</a> When the World-Leader Siddhattha,<br>
the Best Biped had reached nirvana,<br>
his words had been spread; many folks<br>
had embraced <span class='add'>his</span> dispensation. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1' href='#vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw675' href='#jw675'>Walt 675</a> With a pleased heart <span class='add'>and</span> happy mind<br>
I had a lion-throne fashioned.<br>
Having had the lion-throne made,<br>
I had a foot-stool constructed. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2' href='#vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw676' href='#jw676'>Walt 676</a> <span class='add'>And then</span> I had a house built there<br>
<span class='add'>to shield</span> the lion-throne from rain.<br>
Due to the pleasure in my heart<br>
I was reborn in Tusitā. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3' href='#vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw677' href='#jw677'>Walt 677</a> A heavenly mansion, well-built,<br>
existed at that time for me.<br>
In length it measured twenty-four,<br>
in width <span class='add'>another</span> fourteen leagues. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4' href='#vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw678' href='#jw678'>Walt 678</a> Seven thousand <span class='add'>lovely</span> maidens<br>
were always waiting on me <span class='add'>then</span>.<br>
There was a couch made out of gold<br>
well-fashioned in the mansion <span class='add'>there</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5' href='#vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw679' href='#jw679'>Walt 679</a> Elephant- and horse-carriages,<br>
and divine carriages served <span class='add'>me</span>.<br>
Palaces and also litters<br>
were produced according to wish. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6' href='#vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw680' href='#jw680'>Walt 680</a> Couches constructed out of gems<br>
and many other costly things<br>
always came into being for me;<br>
that’s the fruit of a lion-throne. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7' href='#vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw681' href='#jw681'>Walt 681</a> I am always climbing up steps<br>
made of gold and made of silver,<br>
made of crystal, made of lapis;<br>
that is the fruit of the foot-stool. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8' href='#vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw682' href='#jw682'>Walt 682</a> In the ninety-four aeons since<br>
I performed that act <span class='add'>of merit</span>,<br>
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;<br>
that is the fruit of good karma. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9' href='#vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw683' href='#jw683'>Walt 683</a> There were three men <span class='add'>all</span> named Inda<br>
seventy-three aeons ago;<br>
there were three <span class='add'>more</span> named Sumana<br>
seventy-two aeons ago; <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10' href='#vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw684' href='#jw684'>Walt 684</a> <span class='add'>and</span> seventy aeons ago<br>
there were three <span class='add'>kings</span> named Varuṇa;<br>
they were lords of four continents<br>
possessors of the seven gems. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11' href='#vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw685' href='#jw685'>Walt 685</a> The four analytical modes,<br>
and these eight deliverances,<br>
six special knowledges mastered,<br>
<span class='add'>I have</span> done what the Buddha taught! <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12' href='#vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
