<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw1' href='#jw1'>Walt 1</a> The Sage of Vedeha, his body bent, asked<br>
the Thus-Gone-One dwelling in Jetavana,<br>
“Indeed there are those <span class='add'>called</span> Omniscient Buddhas;<br>
through what causes do they become <span class='add'>so</span>, Hero?”</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw2' href='#jw2'>Walt 2</a> Then spoke the Omniscient, Outstanding, Great Sage,<br>
to lucky Ānanda with <span class='add'>his</span> honeyed voice,<br>
“Who performed service among former Buddhas,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> didn’t get freed in their dispensations,</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw3' href='#jw3'>Walt 3</a> because that is the means to awaken, wise,<br>
they with sharp knowing, through knowledge and power,<br>
because of <span class='add'>their</span> wishes <span class='add'>and</span> also great strength,<br>
do come to attain that state of omniscience.</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw4' href='#jw4'>Walt 4</a> I too among former Buddhas<br>
did wish to become a Buddha.<br>
Through <span class='add'>my</span> mind alone there were<br>
innumerable <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-kings.”</p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw5' href='#jw5'>Walt 5</a> <span class='add'>Now</span> listen, with purified minds,<br>
to the legends of the Buddhas,<br>
innumerable <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i>-kings<br>
who fulfilled thirty perfections. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw1' href='#vjw1'>Verse 1</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw6' href='#jw6'>Walt 6</a> I worshipped them <span class='add'>bowing</span> my head,<br>
having praised with ten fingers pressed,<br>
those World-Chiefs with followers <span class='add'>and</span><br>
the Best Buddhas’ Awakening. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw2' href='#vjw2'>Verse 2</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw7' href='#jw7'>Walt 7</a> I brought it all forth with my mind:<br>
things on the ground and in the sky,<br>
uncountable as are the gems<br>
found in the fields of the Buddhas. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw3' href='#vjw3'>Verse 3</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw8' href='#jw8'>Walt 8</a> I created a palace there,<br>
with a floor made out of silver.<br>
Various floors made out of gems<br>
arose and stretched up toward the sky. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw4' href='#vjw4'>Verse 4</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw9' href='#jw9'>Walt 9</a> There were varied well-made pillars,<br>
well-proportioned, very costly.<br>
The central beam was made of gold,<br>
the gate was canopy-adorned. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw5' href='#vjw5'>Verse 5</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw10' href='#jw10'>Walt 10</a> The first floor, lapis lazuli,<br>
was lovely as a stainless cloud.<br>
Lotus ponds were scattered about<br>
on a floor made of superb gold. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw6' href='#vjw6'>Verse 6</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw11' href='#jw11'>Walt 11</a> A coral <span class='add'>floor</span>, coral-colored,<br>
was red and <span class='add'>very</span> beautiful;<br>
<span class='add'>that</span> floor lit up the directions<br>
with light the hue of red beetles. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw7' href='#vjw7'>Verse 7</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw12' href='#jw12'>Walt 12</a> Doors and windows and turrets <span class='add'>too</span>,<br>
and four railings were well-laid-out.<br>
It had a scented bamboo net<br>
which was delightful to the mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw8' href='#vjw8'>Verse 8</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw13' href='#jw13'>Walt 13</a> There were excellent gabled roofs<br>
<span class='add'>colored</span> blue <span class='add'>and</span> yellow <span class='add'>and</span> red,<br>
white <span class='add'>and also</span> mixed black-and-white,<br>
adorned with the seven gemstones. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw9' href='#vjw9'>Verse 9</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw14' href='#jw14'>Walt 14</a> Lovely <span class='add'>pictures of</span> birds and beasts<br>
and lotuses fashioned for looks;<br>
it was adorned with moon and sun,<br>
dotted with star-constellations. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw10' href='#vjw10'>Verse 10</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw15' href='#jw15'>Walt 15</a> It was covered with a gold net<br>
furnished with little golden bells.<br>
Those gold garlands sang in the force<br>
of the wind, delighting the mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw11' href='#vjw11'>Verse 11</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw16' href='#jw16'>Walt 16</a> A garland of flags was hoisted,<br>
dyed in a spectrum of colors:<br>
some light crimson, others deep red,<br>
tawny, yellow and yellowish. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw12' href='#vjw12'>Verse 12</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw17' href='#jw17'>Walt 17</a> Numerous various hundreds<br>
of slabs were made out of silver,<br>
made of crystal, made of ruby,<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> likewise made out of cat’s eye. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw13' href='#vjw13'>Verse 13</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw17e-f' href='#jw17e-f'>Walt 17e-f</a><a class='ref jw' id='jw18' href='#jw18'>Walt 18</a> Various diverse couches were<br>
spread with soft Benares muslin,<br>
rugs, fine silk, and cloth from China,<br>
fibrous cloth and yellow garments.<br>
All of these various carpets<br>
I laid out <span class='add'>on them</span> with my mind. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw14' href='#vjw14'>Verse 14</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw19' href='#jw19'>Walt 19</a> On this floor and that <span class='add'>floor</span> too,<br>
ornamented with huts of gems,<br>
effulgent torches <span class='add'>made of</span> gems<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw20' href='#jw20'>Walt 20</a> Columns <span class='add'>and</span> pillars are splendid,<br>

made of special gold and hard woods,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw21' href='#jw21'>Walt 21</a> Varied windows, well-proportioned;<br>
painted cross-bars <span class='add'>adorned</span> the doors,<br>
with “pots of plenty” on both sides,<br>
filled with lotuses and lilies. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw17' href='#vjw17'>Verse 17</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw22' href='#jw22'>Walt 22</a> I conjured up all past Buddhas,<br>
World-Leaders, <span class='add'>their</span> Assemblies too,<br>
with their natural complexions<br>
<span class='add'>and</span> forms, and <span class='add'>all</span> their followers. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw18' href='#vjw18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw23' href='#jw23'>Walt 23</a> Having entered through the doorway<br>
all the Buddhas and followers<br>
sat down on chairs all made of gold<br>
<span class='add'>and formed</span> an exalted circle. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw19' href='#vjw19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw24' href='#jw24'>Walt 24</a> Those Buddhas who live here-and-now,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw25' href='#jw25'>Walt 25</a> Lonely Buddhas, many hundreds,<br>
Self-dependent, Unconquered Ones,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw26' href='#jw26'>Walt 26</a> There are many wishing-trees there<br>
who are both human and divine.<br>
Having arranged all of the cloth<br>
I give them <span class='add'>each</span> the triple robe. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw22' href='#vjw22'>Verse 22</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw27' href='#jw27'>Walt 27</a> Filling lovely bowls made of gems<br>
I then provided <span class='add'>alms</span> to them:<br>

well-prepared food and drink to taste. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw23' href='#vjw23'>Verse 23</a></p>
