<h1>16. The Ghost Nanda</h1>
</header>
<p>Nandasena sees a ghost and questions,</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nandasena:</span></p>
<p>You are very dark and ugly with red eyes and black teeth. You look very nasty. I don’t think that you are a human.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nanda (ghost):</span></p>
<p>Oh Nandasena, I am Nanda. I was your wife in the human world. Since I did lots of evil things, I was reborn in the ghost world.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nandasena:</span></p>
<p>What bad things did you do by body, speech, or mind in order to be reborn in the ghost world?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nanda:</span></p>
<p>When I lived with you in the human world, I was very cruel to you by speaking harshly. I did not respect you at all. That is why I was reborn in the ghost world.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nandasena:</span></p>
<p>Here, I will give you my cloak to wear and then we can go back home. You can have beautiful clothes, food, and drink there. Also, you can see your sons and daughters-in-law.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nanda:</span></p>
<p>Sadly, I cannot receive anything that is given directly by your hands. But you can help me by giving alms to virtuous monks who know the Dhamma well and are free from passion. Share the merit that you gain with me, and then I will be happy with all the comforts in the world.</p>
<p>Nandasena agreed and offered food, drink, shelter, robes, umbrellas, flowers, and incense to virtuous monks and shared the merit he collected with the ghost Nanda. The result of this donation immediately took effect in the form of food, drink, and clothing for the ghost. She became pure, wearing the cleanest and finest clothes with jewelry and then approached Nandasena.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nandasena:</span></p>
<p>Who are you, with heavenly beauty, shining in all directions like a star? Why are you so beautiful? What merit have you collected when you were a human?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nanda:</span></p>
<p>Oh Nandasena, I am Nanda. I was your wife in the human world. Since I did lots of evil things, I was reborn in the ghost world. But now through the gift given by you, I am very happy and do not fear anything.</p>
<p>I bless you. May you live long and happily with your relatives.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Nandasena:</span></p>
<p>Yes my dear, one should practice the Dhamma and be generous by giving alms. The person who does this will be reborn in heaven where there is no sorrow.</p>
