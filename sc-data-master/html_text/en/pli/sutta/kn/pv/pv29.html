<h1>29. The Hay Ghost</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='speaker'>Monk:</span></p>
<p>One ghost spreads burning hay on his head while another hits himself on the head with an iron rod. And a third ghost eats his own flesh and blood.</p>
<p>You are eating filthy and disgusting excrement. Why is this happening? Of what evil deeds are these the results?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Ghost:</span></p>
<p>The ghost putting burning hay on his head injured his mother in the human world, while the one hitting himself on the head with an iron rod was a dishonest and cunning trader. The ghost eating his own flesh and blood stole meat and lied about it to the seller.</p>
<p>For my case, in the human world I was a very bossy housewife who ordered others around in the family. Even though I was capable of giving gifts to others, I was greedy and never gave anything. When people came to my house begging for food, I hid the food and lied by swearing an oath, saying, “There is no food in my house, believe me. If there is any that I have hidden, then let it turn to excrement and I will eat it!”</p>
<p>It is the result of both greed and the fact that I lied. Now good rice turns into excrement when I am about to eat it.</p>
<p>All actions have a result; the results of bad deeds will not simply go away without ripening. Therefore because of my bad deeds I must eat and drink this filthy and disgusting excrement full of worms.</p>
