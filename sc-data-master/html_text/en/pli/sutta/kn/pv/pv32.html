<h1>32. The Deer-Hunter</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='speaker'>Man:</span></p>
<p>You are young and surrounded by male and female deities. You look very happy with all the pleasures that you have. But in the daytime, you experience very painful feelings. What did you do in your previous life?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Ghost:</span></p>
<p>I was a cruel deer hunter living in the city of Rajagaha. I was always looking for something to kill. I did not have any pity on innocent beings.</p>
<p>I had a friend who was very compassionate, a disciple of the Supreme Buddha. He always said, “Do not do evil deeds my friend; do not be reborn in a bad world. If you wish to go to a happy world after death, then stop killing living beings.”</p>
<p>I did not listen to his advice because I took pleasure in killing and was very foolish.</p>
<p>My friend again advised me saying “If you must kill in the daytime, then please at least stop killing at night.”</p>
<p>So I killed living beings in the daytime and stopped during the night.</p>
<p>That is why I enjoy heavenly pleasures at night, but in the day, dogs come and tear off my flesh.</p>
<p>Even though I only restrained from killing at night, I still gained good results from it. Now I imagine the disciples of the Supreme Buddha who practice the Dhamma diligently throughout their lives surely will attain the supreme bliss of Nibbana.</p>
