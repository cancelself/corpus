<h1>43. Excrement Eating Male Ghost</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='speaker'>Moggallana Bhante:</span></p>
<p>Oh unlucky one, you are standing in a pit of excrement. Who are you? What kind of evil deed did you do? How can I know for sure what happened to you?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Ghost:</span></p>
<p>Bhante, I am a ghost. As a result of my evil deeds I have been born in this ghost world. I am suffering very much</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Moggallana Bhante:</span></p>
<p>What kind of evil deed did you do by body, speech, or mind to suffer like this?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Ghost:</span></p>
<p>When I was in the human world, I let a monk stay in my house. The monk was very greedy and jealous of his supporters. He insulted good monks.</p>
<p>I listened to that evil monk’s words. Following him, I too insulted good monks. That is the evil deed I did from which I was reborn in the ghost world.</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Moggallana Bhante:</span></p>
<p>You associated with that evil monk thinking that he was a good friend. What happened to the monk after death?</p>
<p><span class='speaker'>Ghost:</span></p>
<p>Bhante, that evil monk has also been born in the ghost world. He is suffering in the same pit of excrement where I suffer. I am standing on his head. He lives as a servant to me here.</p>
<p>Bhante, I have to eat other people’s excrement, while he has to eat mine.</p>
