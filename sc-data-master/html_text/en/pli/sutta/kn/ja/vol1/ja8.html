<h1>8. Gamani Jātaka</h1>
</header>
<p>“Their heart’s desire.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about a Brother who gave up persevering. In this Jataka both the Introductory Story and the Story of the Past will be given in the Eleventh Book in connexion with the Samvara-jataka; the incidents are the same both for that Jataka and for this, but the stanzas are different.</p>
<p>Abiding stedfast in the counsels of the Bodhisatta, Prince Gamani, finding himself—though the youngest of a hundred brothers—surrounded by those hundred brothers as a retinue and seated beneath the white canopy of kingship, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en30' href='#pts-vp-en30'>PTS vp En 30</a> contemplated his glory and thought—“All this glory I owe to my teacher.” And, in his joy, he burst into this heartfelt utterance—</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Their heart’s desire they reap, who hurry not;<br>
Know, Gamani, ripe excellence is thine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli137' href='#pts-vp-pli137'>PTS vp Pali 137</a> Seven or eight days after he had become king, all his brothers departed to their own homes. King Gamani, after ruling his kingdom in righteousness, passed away to fare according to his deserts. The Bodhisatta also passed away to fare according to his deserts.</p>
<hr>
<p>His lesson ended, the Master preached the Truths, at the close whereof the faint-hearted Brother won Arahatship. Having told the two stories, the Master shewed the connexion linking them both together and identified the Birth.</p>
