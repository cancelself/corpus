<h1>28. Living in Discomfort</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, possessed of two things, a bhikkhu lives in discomfort here and now, bringing upon himself vexation, trouble, and distress, and when the body perishes after death a bad bourn is to be expected. What are the two? Being unguarded regarding the doors of the senses and being immoderate in eating. These are the two things possessed of which a bhikkhu lives in discomfort…”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The eye, ear, nose, tongue,<br>
Body and likewise the mind—<br>
A bhikkhu who leaves these doors<br>
Unguarded here,</p>
<p>Immoderate in eating,<br>
Of uncontrolled senses,<br>
Experiences suffering<br>
Both bodily and mental.</p>
<p>Being tormented by body,<br>
And tormented by mind,<br>
Such a one lives in discomfort<br>
Both by day and by night.</p>
