<h1>11. Understanding Delusion</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, one who has not directly known and fully understood delusion, who has not detached his mind from it and abandoned it, is incapable of destroying suffering. But one who has directly known and fully understood delusion, and who has detached his mind from it and abandoned it, is capable of destroying suffering.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Humankind is possessed by delusion,<br>
Bound by delusion and delighted with being;<br>
Not fully understanding delusion,<br>
They come again to renewal of being.</p>
<p>But those who have abandoned delusion,<br>
And who by destroying delusion are freed,<br>
Have conquered the bondage of delusion<br>
And overcome all suffering.</p>
