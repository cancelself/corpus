<h1>17. The Good Friend</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, in regard to external factors, I do not perceive another single factor so helpful as good friendship for a bhikkhu who is a learner, who has not attained perfection but lives aspiring for the supreme security from bondage. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who has a good friend abandons what is unwholesome and develops what is wholesome.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>When a bhikkhu has good friends,<br>
And is reverential and respectful,<br>
Doing what his friends advise,<br>
Clearly comprehending and mindful,<br>
He may progressively attain<br>
The destruction of all fetters.</p>
