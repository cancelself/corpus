<h1>73. More Peaceful</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, the formless is more peaceful than the form realm, and cessation is more peaceful than the formless.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Those beings who reach the form realm<br>
And those established in the formless,<br>
If they do not know cessation<br>
Come back to renewal of being.</p>
<p>Those who fully understand forms<br>
Without getting stuck in the formless,<br>
Are released into cessation<br>
And leave Death far behind them.</p>
<p>Having touched with his own person<br>
The deathless element free from clinging,<br>
Having realized the relinquishment of clinging,<br>
His taints all gone,<br>
The Fully Enlightened One proclaims<br>
The sorrowless state that is void of stain.</p>
</blockquote>
