<h1>65. Good Conduct</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, there are these three kinds of good conduct. What are the three? Good conduct by body, good conduct by speech, and good conduct by mind. These are the three.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Having abandoned misconduct<br>
By body, misconduct by speech,<br>
Misconduct by mind, and whatever else<br>
Is reckoned a fault—</p>
<p>Not having done a bad deed<br>
And done much that is good—<br>
When his body perishes<br>
That wise one is reborn in heaven.</p>
</blockquote>
