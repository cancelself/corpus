<h1>92. The Hem of the Robe</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, even though a bhikkhu might hold on to the hem of my robe and follow close behind me step by step, if he is covetous for objects of desire, strongly passionate, malevolent, corrupt in thought, unmindful, uncomprehending, unconcentrated, of wandering mind and uncontrolled faculties, he is far from me and I am far from him. What is the reason? That bhikkhu does not see Dhamma. Not seeing Dhamma, he does not see me.</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, even though a bhikkhu might live a hundred leagues away, if he is not covetous for objects of desire, not strongly passionate, not malevolent, uncorrupt in thought, with mindfulness established, clearly comprehending, concentrated, of unified mind and controlled faculties, he is close to me and I am close to him. What is the reason? That bhikkhu sees Dhamma. Seeing Dhamma, he sees me.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Though closely following behind,<br>
Full of longings and resentment,<br>
See how far away he is—<br>
The desirous one from the desireless,<br>
One unquenched from the quenched,<br>
A greedy one from the one without greed.</p>
<p>But a wise person who by direct knowledge<br>
Has fully understood the Dhamma,<br>
Becomes desireless and tranquil<br>
Like a calm unruffled lake.</p>
<p>See how close he is to him—<br>
A desireless one to the desireless,<br>
One quenched to the quenched,<br>
The greedless one to the one without greed.</p>
