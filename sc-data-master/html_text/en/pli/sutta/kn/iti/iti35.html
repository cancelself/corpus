<h1>35. Not Deceiving (1)</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, this holy life is not lived for the sake of deceiving people, for the sake of cajoling people, for the sake of profiting in gain, honour, and fame, nor with the idea, ‘Let people know me thus.’ This holy life, bhikkhus, is lived for the sake of restraint and abandoning.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The Lord taught a holy life<br>
Not based on tradition,<br>
For restraint and abandoning,<br>
Leading to and merging in Nibbāna.</p>
<p>This is the path followed by the great,<br>
Pursued by the lofty sages.<br>
Those who enter that course<br>
As taught by the Enlightened One,<br>
Heeding the Teacher’s instruction,<br>
Will make an end of suffering.</p>
