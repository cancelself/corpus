<h1>41. Deprived of Wisdom</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, those beings are thoroughly deprived who are deprived of noble wisdom. They live in discomfort even here and now, with vexation, trouble, and distress, and when the body perishes at death a bad bourn is to be expected.</p>
<p>“Those beings are not deprived who are not deprived of noble wisdom. They live in comfort here and now, without vexation, trouble, or distress, and when the body perishes at death a good bourn is to be expected.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>See the world with its devas,<br>
Destitute of wisdom,<br>
Established in name-and-form,<br>
Conceiving this to be the truth.</p>
<p>Wisdom which leads to penetration<br>
Is the best thing in the world;<br>
By this one completely understands<br>
The ending of both birth and being.</p>
<p>Devas and human beings hold dear<br>
Those awakened ones ever mindful,<br>
Possessing joyous wisdom,<br>
Bearing their final bodies.</p>
</blockquote>
