<h1>59. Māra’s Domain</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus, being in possession of three things, a bhikkhu has passed beyond the domain of Māra and shines like the sun. What are the three? Herein a bhikkhu is in possession of the non-learner’s aggregate of virtue, the non-learner’s aggregate of concentration, and the non-learner’s aggregate of wisdom. These are the three things in possession of which a bhikkhu has passed beyond the domain of Māra and shines like the sun.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Virtue, concentration, and wisdom—<br>
One in whom these are fully developed,<br>
On passing beyond Māra’s domain,<br>
Shines forth like the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
