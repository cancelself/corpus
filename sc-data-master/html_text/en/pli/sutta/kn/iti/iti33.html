<h1>33. Behaviour (2)</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“Possessing two things, bhikkhus, a person is placed in heaven as if carried there. What are the two things? Good behaviour and a good view. These are the two things…”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>If a person possesses these two things—<br>
Good behaviour and a good view—<br>
When his body perishes<br>
That wise one is reborn in heaven.</p>
