<h1>23. Diligence</h1>
</header>
<p>This was said by the Lord…</p>
<p>“There is one thing, bhikkhus, developed and continually practised, by which both kinds of welfare are acquired and maintained: welfare here and now, and that pertaining to the future. What is that one thing? It is diligence in wholesome states. This is that one thing…”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>The wise praise diligence<br>
In doing deeds of merit;<br>
For one who is wise and diligent<br>
Obtains a twofold benefit:</p>
<p>Welfare in the here and now<br>
And welfare in a future life.<br>
And because one has realized the good,<br>
The wise person is called a sage.</p>
