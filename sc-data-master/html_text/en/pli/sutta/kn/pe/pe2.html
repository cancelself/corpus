<p><span class='add'>[Now as to the words]</span> “This world is born to anguish … down to … <span class='add'>[And what it fears is]</span> pain” is <i>corruption</i> by craving. <span class='add'>[The passage]</span> “Whoever have declared escape from being <span class='add'>[to come about]</span> through <span class='add'>[love of]</span> non-being, none of them, I say, escapes from being.

<p>81. These <span class='add'>[are eight of the]</span> sixteen types of Thread completely encompassing all the Dispensation: the ninefold Thread is analysed into these sixteen Thread-types. And this ninefold Thread is for one with understanding, not for one without understanding, for one devoted, not for one undevoted.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3>1. Corruption—3 kinds</h3>
<p>82. Normally in the world corruption haunts <span class='add'>[even]</span> one who abides without action. That corruption is threefold as (i) corruption by craving, (ii) corruption by View, and (iii) corruption by misconduct.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[Now]</span> when he comes to stand out above (iii) that <span class='add'>[last-named type of]</span> corruption, then corruption establishes itself in the ideas <span class='add'>[that he heard, and]</span> it establishes itself in ideas belonging to the worlds, since he is unskilled as to what is seen there.</p>
<p>If he misapprehends that virtue: <span class='add'>[owed to his climbing out of corruption by misconduct]</span> and that view, then he has (i) corruption by craving. But if it occurs to him thus (<i>By means of this virtue or</i> <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en35' href='#pts-vp-en35'>PTS vp En 35</a> <i>duty … or divine life I shall be some god or other, then he has wrong view, and that is (ii) his corruption by wrong view</i>.</p>
<h3>2. Morality</h3>
<p>83. But if he is established in virtue and his virtue-and-duty is not misapprehended, then he being virtuous, that <span class='add'>[virtue-and-duty]</span> of his, being taken in a reasoned manner, generates (<i>non-remorse</i> … down to … <i>knowing and seeing of deliverance</i>). And that good conduct thus conduces to his morality, <span class='add'>[that is, to his moral progress]</span> either here and now or on the occasion of his completing his time,  or in other categories in some future existence. That is why this is called the type of Thread Dealing with Morality.</p>
<h3>3. Penetration</h3>
<p>84. Herein, <span class='add'>[when,]</span> being steadied in the virtues, his cognizance is without hindrances, <span class='add'>[then]</span> the Blessed One teaches him that True Idea for the abandoning of the embodiment-view.</p>
<p>85. <span class='add'>[Finally]</span> he reaches the supreme goal, extinction: he reaches the supreme extinction either with intervals between sessions, or else in a single session <span class='add'>[he reaches all]</span> the six Acquaintanceships.</p>
<p>86.<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli30' href='#pts-vp-pli30'>PTS vp Pli 30</a> Herein, those persons who <span class='add'>[first]</span> reach <span class='add'>[extinction]</span> in the Noble Ones' True Idea are of two kinds: the Follower by Faith and the Follower by Ideas.</p>
<p>Herein, the Follower by Ideas is (<i>one who gains knowledge from</i> <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en36' href='#pts-vp-en36'>PTS vp En 36</a> <i>a condensed statement</i>) while the Follower by Faith is  (<i>guidable</i>).</p>
<p>Herein, one who gains knowledge from a condensed statement is of two kinds: one may have keen faculties and another blunt faculties. And herein, one who is guidable is of two kinds: one may have keen faculties and another blunt faculties.</p>
<p>87. Herein, the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement with blunt faculties and the guidable-type with keen faculties <span class='add'>[when classed as above under the two types]</span> are unequal in their faculties; <span class='add'>[but when]</span> they are subtracted <span class='add'>[respectively]</span> from the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement and from the guidable-type, they, <span class='add'>[being then regardable as]</span> equal in their faculties, <span class='add'>[constitute a third type, namely]</span> the (<i>one who gains knowledge from an expanded statement</i>). These are thus the three person-types, without fourth and without fifth the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement, the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement, and the guidable-type.</p>
<p>88. Herein, the person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement, <span class='add'>[whether]</span> the faculties he obtains <span class='add'>[are blunt or keen]</span>, when, being steadied on the plane of seeing, he reaches the fruit of Stream-Entry, he is a Single-Seed, the first type of Stream-Enterer. Herein, the person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement, <span class='add'>[whether]</span> the faculties he obtains <span class='add'>[are blunt or keen]</span>, when, being steadied on the plane of seeing, he reaches the fruit of Stream-Entry, he is a Clan-to-Clan, the second type of Stream-Enterer. Herein, the person of the guidable-type, <span class='add'>[whether]</span> the faculties <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en37' href='#pts-vp-en37'>PTS vp En 37</a> he obtains <span class='add'>[are blunt or keen]</span>, when, being steadied on the plane of seeing, he reaches the fruit of Stream-Entry, he is a Seven-times-at-Most, the third type of Stream-Enterer.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[Now]</span> these three types of persons are steadied in the fruit of Stream-Entry with diversity in their faculties, <span class='add'>[and it is with diversity of faculties in each case]</span> that the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement is a Single-Germ, the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement is a Clan-to-Clan and the guidable-type is a Seven-at-Most.</p>
<p>This is the type of Thread Dealing with Penetration.</p>
<h3>4. The Adept</h3>
<p>89.<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli31' href='#pts-vp-pli31'>PTS vp Pli 31</a> Now it is if someone makes efforts additional to that, that he reaches the supreme goal, extinction.</p>
<p>90. Herein, the keen-facultied person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement becomes two person-types on reaching the Non-Return Fruit: there is he-who-attains-extinction-early <span class='add'>[in his next existence]</span> and he-who-attains-extinction-late <span class='add'>[there]</span>.</p>
<p>Herein, the keen-facultied person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement becomes two person-types on reaching the Non-Return Fruit: there is he-who-attains-extinction-without-prompting-determinations and he-who-attains-extinction-with-prompting-determinations.</p>
<p>Herein, the person of guidable-type, on reaching the Non-Return Fruit, is an Up-Streamer-Bound-For-The-Not-Junior-Gods.</p>
<p>91. <span class='add'>[But]</span> by taking account of difference in their faculties <span class='add'>[in the cases of]</span> the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement and the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement: <span class='add'>[then]</span> the keen-facultied person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement is one-who-attains-extinction-early,  while the blunt-facultied one of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en38' href='#pts-vp-en38'>PTS vp En 38</a>condensed-statement is one-who-attains-extinction-late; <span class='add'>[then]</span> the keen-facultied one of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement is one-who-attains-extinction-without-prompting-determinations, while the blunt-facultied one of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement is one-who-attains-extinction-with-prompting-determinations. The guidable-type is the Up-Streamer-Bound-For-The-Not-Junior-Gods.</p>
<p>92. So the five kinds of Non-Returner, the Once-Returner as sixth, and the three kinds of Stream-Enterer, make up nine kinds of Initiate.</p>
<p>93. Herein, the keen-facultied person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement becomes two person-types on reaching Arahantship: the Both-Ways-Liberated and the Liberated-By-Understanding.</p>
<p>Herein, the blunt-facultied person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-a-condensed-statement becomes two person-types on reaching Arahantship: the Aeon-Delayer and the Essence-Of-Penetration.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en39' href='#pts-vp-en39'>PTS vp En 39</a><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli32' href='#pts-vp-pli32'>PTS vp Pli 32</a> Herein, the keen-facultied person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement becomes two person-types on reaching Arahantship: the Able-By-Choice and the Able-By-Guarding.</p>
<p>Herein, the blunt-facultied person of the type-gaining-knowledge-from-an-expanded-statement becomes two person-types on reaching Arahantship: the No-Extinction-Attainer-If-He-Chooses-Extinction-Attainer-If-He-Does-Not-Choose and the No-Extinction-Attainer-If-He-Guards-Extinction-Attainer-If-He-Does-Not-Guard.</p>
<p>Herein, the person of guidable-type who is not devoted to the pursuit of development is One-Liable-To-Fall-Away, or else owing to his being One-Certain-In-Action he becomes a Level-Head.</p>
<p>94. These are nine types of Arahants.</p>
<p>95. This is the fourfold Thread, namely that Dealing with Corruption, … that Dealing with the Adept.</p>
<h3>The 10 Powers of a Perfect One</h3>
<p>96. Now a Perfect One has a tenfold Power that occurs with regard to these person-types. How tenfold? Here when the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en40' href='#pts-vp-en40'>PTS vp En 40</a> Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, have not yet set rolling the Wheel of the True Idea, gods' sons of great influence issue forth (?) to implore them thus (<i>Let the Sublime One teach the True Idea</i>). And he <span class='add'>[the newly Enlightened One]</span>, on surveying the world with the unsurpassed Enlightened One's eye, sees three classes of creatures: the certain-of-rightness, the certain-of-wrongness and the not-certain.</p>
<h4>1. Knowledge of Instance and Non-Instance</h4>
<p>97. Herein, that the certain-of-rightness class might enter into wrong mindfulness (?): no such instance is found. That it might attain extinction without a teacher: no such instance is found. That it might enter upon an attainment <span class='add'>[of concentration]</span>: such an instance is found.</p>
<p>98. Herein, that the certain-of-wrongness class will practise noble right practice: no such instance is found. That it will practise ignoble wrong practice: such an instance is found.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli33' href='#pts-vp-pli33'>PTS vp Pli 33</a> Herein, (1) that the not-certain class, when rightly practising, will go to the certain-of-rightness class: such an instance is found. (2) That, when wrongly practising, it will go to the certain-of-rightness class: no such instance is found. (3) That, when rightly practising, it will go to the certain-of-wrongness class: no such instance is found. (4) That, when wrongly practising, it will go to the certain-of-wrongness class: such an instance is found.</p>
<p>99. (a) That anyone will in accordance with a True Idea accuse me thus “You, a Fully Enlightened One, who are surveying these <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en41' href='#pts-vp-en41'>PTS vp En 41</a> three <span class='add'>[classes]</span> with the unsurpassed Enlightened Ones' eye, have not discovered these ideas”: no such instance is found.</p>
<p>100. (b) That anyone will in accordance with a True Idea accuse me, claiming <span class='add'>[as I do]</span> to be without lust, of having taints still unexhausted: no such instance is found.</p>
<p>101. (c) That after the teaching of the True Idea to this not-certain class it will not be seen <span class='add'>[to conduce]</span> to the complete exhaustion of suffering in him who gives it effect: no such instance is found.</p>
<p>102. (d) That a hearer of mine belonging to the not-certain class, being thus advised, will not verify any progressive distinction: no such instance is found.</p>
<p>103. (ii) That whoever of the many kinds of gods, naga-serpents or spirits with their many languages a Stilled One tames <span class='add'>[in those languages]</span> will go to a further shore other than the further shore stated by the definition of ideas <span class='add'>[in the language of the texts]</span>: no such instance is found: The Discrimination of Ideas.</p>
<p>104. (iii) That <span class='add'>[a Stilled One]</span> should not master those languages uttered by creatures as <span class='add'>[their]</span> language: no such instance is found: The Discrimination of Language.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en42' href='#pts-vp-en42'>PTS vp En 42</a>105. (1) That <span class='add'>[such]</span> language <span class='add'>[so used by him]</span> should not intimate that meaning to those hearers who delight in the path that is not uneven (unrighteous): no such instance is found: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli34' href='#pts-vp-pli34'>PTS vp Pli 34</a> The Discrimination of Meanings.</p>
<p>106. (iv) That when influential gods' sons approach and ask <span class='add'>[a Stilled One]</span> questions, the meaning might not be perspicuous to him because of his being bodily or mentally oppressed or because of his being embarrassed through palsy of a hand or lameness of a foot: no such instance is found: The Discrimination of Perspicuity.</p>
<p>107. That wherein quieting (?) of these is, therein non-quieting (?) of these is: no such instance is found. That wherein destruction of these is not, therein destruction of these will be: no such instance is found. <span class='add'>[And as]</span> for Origin, so for Cessation.</p>
<p>108. The ten unprofitable <span class='add'>[and profitable]</span> courses of action.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en43' href='#pts-vp-en43'>PTS vp En 43</a>109. That womankind will be Māra or <span class='add'>[Sakka]</span> Ruler <span class='add'>[of Gods]</span> or a High Divinity or a Perfect One or a Wheel-Turner <span class='add'>[Monarch]</span>; no such instance is found. That a male may be a Wheel-Turner or Sakka Ruler of Gods: such an instance is found.</p>
<p>110. So such power, such knowledge, as this is called the Knowledge of Instance and No-Instance, the first Power of a Perfect One.</p>
<p>111. That can be demonstrated by the three classes, the four Intrepidities, the four Discriminations, Dependent Arising in <span class='add'>[its]</span> occurrence and standstill, and what happens in unprofitable and profitable ripening, and for the female and the male on reappearance.</p>
<p>A Perfect One knows this Power thus.</p>
<h4>2. Knowledge of the Way that Leads Anywhere</h4>
<p>112. Now as to the certain-of-rightness class <span class='add'>[out]</span> of <span class='add'>[those three classes]</span> which <span class='add'>[were mentioned above]</span>, this is not the Way that Leads Anywhere, this is the way that leads only to extinction. Likewise also the certain-of-wrongness class, which is not the Way that Leads Anywhere, this is only <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli35' href='#pts-vp-pli35'>PTS vp Pli 35</a> the way leading to origin of embodiment. It is this <span class='add'>[not-certain class, which]</span>, when steadied in a way <span class='add'>[going]</span> here or there, goes to extinction, goes to the state of unease, and goes to the divine and human states, or may go anywhere according to whatever way it may practise: this is the Way that Leads Anywhere.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en44' href='#pts-vp-en44'>PTS vp En 44</a>113. Knowledge of how it is herein, is called Knowledge of the Way that Leads Anywhere, the second Power of a Perfect One.</p>
<h4>3. Knowledge of Difference of Belief</h4>
<p>114. Now this Way that Leads Anywhere <span class='add'>[is followed by those]</span> of differing beliefs: some <span class='add'>[believe]</span> in sensual desires, and some in performance of difficult feats, some are devoted to self-torment, some rely on <span class='add'>[belief in]</span> purity through the roundabout <span class='add'>[of rebirths]</span>, some <span class='add'>[believe in]</span> ineffectuality <span class='add'>[of action (?)]</span>.</p>
<p>115. Knowledge of how creatures come to be bound down by <span class='add'>[the habit of]</span> this or that kind of temperament understands how the world's varied field of beliefs comes to be.</p>
<p>116. This is the third Power of a Perfect One.</p>
<h4>4. Knowledge of the Different Elements</h4>
<p>117. Herein, when creatures are of such a belief, that <span class='add'>[belief of theirs]</span> they repeat, keep in being and make much of. When they repeat (?) it <span class='add'>[thus]</span>, believing in it, that element sustains them. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en45' href='#pts-vp-en45'>PTS vp En 45</a> What is that? It is the sensual-desire element, the renunciation element, the ill-will element, the non-ill-will element, the cruelty element and the non-cruelty element that are believed in. Any other element beyond <span class='add'>[namely the undetermined element beyond the determined element]</span> they do not see; (<i>obstinately misapprehending and insisting upon that alone, they assert “Only this is the true, the other is wrong”</i>), as was said by the Blessed One to Sakka Ruler of Gods.</p>
<p>118. Knowledge of how it is herein, is called the fourth Power of a Perfect One.</p>
<h4>5. Knowledge of Ripening of Action</h4>
<p>119. Herein, whatever element <span class='add'>[they believe]</span> best, that they instigate through the body and through speech. The instigation is mental <span class='add'>[choice]</span> while the choice-as-action is <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli36' href='#pts-vp-pli36'>PTS vp Pli 36</a> is bodily and verbal. Because of the mentalness of the instigation a Perfect One understands the action-sequence thus “By this creature, who has such elements, such action was done, that being in the past period; with this as cause, such ripening of it is ripening now or will ripen in the future period”. He understands the presently arisen period thus “This person, who has such elements, is doing this action through craving and view; with this as cause, its ripening will be generated not only here and now but also either on the next reappearance or in some future state”. He understands <span class='add'>[the future period]</span> thus “This person will do such action; with this as cause <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en46' href='#pts-vp-en46'>PTS vp En 46</a> such ripening of it will be generated”. There are (<i>four undertakings of action:</i> (i) <i>this kind of undertaking of action has presently arisen pleasure and ripens as pleasure in the future;</i> (ii) … <i>etc</i>. …).</p>
<p>120. So he understands this past, future, and presently arisen undertaking of action as to cause and as to instance, and the variety in its ripening, and the highness and lowness, the inferiority and superiority <span class='add'>[of creatures]</span>. This is called the Knowledge of Ripening of Action, the fifth Power of a Perfect One.</p>
<h4>6. Knowledge of Corruption, etc., in the cases of the Meditations, etc.</h4>
121. Herein, whatever undertaking of action creatures are undertaking, therein he understands thus “When a person is a believer in <span class='add'>[efficacy of]</span> action and of lusting temperament, his cognizance (?) comes to fulfilment by means of the renunciation element. When he is occupied with the field of lust, his first meditation is corrupted; but if he again makes further efforts, then he is pursuing the way dealing with distinction <span class='add'>[but doing so]</span> on the mental level whose field of cleansing is the <span class='add'>[first]</span> meditation; for his meditation is <span class='add'>[then still]</span> only of the kind dealing with loss. Once steadied in the first meditation, then the second meditation comes to be his cleansing. And then, when he desires to enter upon the third <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli37' href='#pts-vp-pli37'>PTS vp Pli 37</a> meditation, the joy faculty invades his cognizance and remains <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en47' href='#pts-vp-en47'>PTS vp En 47</a> steady. That happiness of his remains steady indicating the third meditation but not as dealing with distinction. If he understands how the escape is in its case, then in the same way the fourth meditation comes to be the cleansing too. <span class='add'>[Now]</span> there are the ideas <span class='add'>[namely]</span> the factors of the third meditation that deal with the loss of the fourth meditation, and where these ideas are produced it is by <span class='add'>[the surmounting of]</span> them that the fourth meditation is indicated as the cleansing. Similarly the Formless (?) Attainments, the four Concentrations (?), the three Gateways to Liberation, and the eight Liberations”.
<ol>
<li><i>Meditations</i>: the four Meditations.</li>
<li><i>Liberations</i>: the eight liberations and the three Gateways to Liberation.</li>
<li><i>Concentration</i>: the four kinds of concentration, namely concentration through will, concentration through energy, concentration through cognizance, and concentration through inquiry.</li>
<li><i>Attainments</i>: the four Formless (?) Attainments.</li>
</ol>
<p>So when a person is of lusting temperament, such is the corruption of his meditations, liberations, <span class='add'>[concentrations,]</span> and attainments. Likewise for one of hating temperament and for one of deluded temperament. And when a person is of lusting temperament, such is his cleansing.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en48' href='#pts-vp-en48'>PTS vp En 48</a>122. So knowledge of how it is herein, which is not shared <span class='add'>[by disciples]</span>, is called the sixth Power of a Perfect One.</p>
<h4>7. Knowledge of the Disposition of Creatures' Faculties</h4>
<p>123. Herein, a Perfect One understands thus “Ideas belonging to worlds and ideas dissociated from worlds acquire the name ‘faculty’ when dealing with keeping-in-being in dependence upon the plane of <span class='add'>[respective]</span> predominance. They acquire the name ‘power’ in dependence upon the mind-faculty as confirmed mind-faculty; they acquire the name ‘energy’ in dependence upon the element of instigation”, so such being his knowledge, he also made the teaching of the True Idea thus “These persons are possessed of these ideas, according to the mood and according to the constituent of the leaning and inclination in the beliefs they possess”.</p>
<p>124.<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli38' href='#pts-vp-pli38'>PTS vp Pli 38</a> This is called Knowledge of Variety in the Faculties, Powers, and Energy, of other creatures, other persons, the seventh Power of a Perfect One.</p>
<h4>8. The Recollection of Past Life, 9. The Heavenly Eye</h4>
<p>125. Herein, by means of two powers a Perfect One understands the destination, in the planes and the worlds, etc., of those who have fetters and of those who are Initiates, <span class='add'>[understanding it]</span> in the past roundabout by means of the Recollection of Past Life <span class='add'>[and understanding their]</span> decease and reappearance now in this presently arisen <span class='add'>[roundabout]</span> by means of the Heavenly Eye. Thus these two powers are directed to the Heavenly Eye: that which was the Heavenly Eye's province in the past period becomes Mindfulness's province now.</p>
<p>126. So there is knowledge of his own past life in various ways and different aspects, and of others in the present period by means of the Heavenly Eye. These are two Powers of a Perfect One: Past Life the eighth and the Heavenly Eye the ninth.</p>
<h4>10. Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taints</h4>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en49' href='#pts-vp-en49'>PTS vp En 49</a>127. Again, a Perfect One understands the meditation of noble persons to be a cleansing and dealing with penetration thus “This person, having by means of this Path, by means of this Way, here and now verified and entered upon the heart-deliverance and understanding-deliverance that are taintless through exhaustion of taints, abides <span class='add'>[therein]</span>”. Such is the knowledge about the exhaustion of <span class='add'>[his]</span> own taints and the appropriate four-plane <span class='add'>[knowledge]</span> of those coefficient with view <span class='add'>[exhausted by the Stream-Enterer]</span> down to <span class='add'>[that of those exhausted on the plane]</span> of the nine kinds of Arahants, the exhaustion of taints <span class='add'>[occurring]</span> limitedly for Initiates and unlimitedly for Arahants. Herein, heart-deliverance is taintless with respect to two taints, namely the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being, while understanding-deliverance is taintless with respect to two taints, namely the taint of views and the taint of ignorance.</p>
<p>128. The knowledge of these two deliverances, how they come to be,  <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli39' href='#pts-vp-pli39'>PTS vp Pli 39</a> is called Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taints, the tenth Power of a Perfect One.</p>
<h3>The 4 Types of Thread as 5 Types</h3>
<p>129. Steadied in these ten Powers, a Perfect One teaches the Dispensation in five types <span class='add'>[of teaching]</span> thus: (1) that dealing with corruption, (2) that dealing with morality, (3a) that dealing with seeing, (3b) that dealing with keeping in being, and (4) that dealing with the Adept.</p>
<h4>1. Corruption</h4>
<p>130. Herein, non-greed is the escape from corruption by craving non-delusion is the escape from corruption by view, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en50' href='#pts-vp-en50'>PTS vp En 50</a> and the three profitable <span class='add'>[roots together]</span> are the escape from corruption by misconduct. Why? Because there are these three kinds of mental misconduct, namely (i) covetousness, (ii) ill will, and (iii) wrong view.</p>
<p>131. Herein, (i) <i>covetousness</i> as mental misconduct assists the bodily action consisting in taking-what-is-not-given, and it aids all the speech-action anchored thereto, namely false speech—all speech that denies reality and what is, all contempt and domineering—and <span class='add'>[it aids]</span> covetousness as a root of unprofit. In the case of the <span class='add'>[corresponding]</span> good conduct, the good conduct is the choice of abstention from the false speech, from the taking-what-is-not-given, and from the covetousness.</p>
<p>132. Herein, (ii) <i>ill will</i> as mental misconduct aids the bodily action consisting in killing-breathing-things, and it aids all that verbal action consisting in refuting by “dragging to and dragging fro and jolting up”, <span class='add'>[and]</span> malicious speech <span class='add'>[and]</span> harsh speech.</p>
<p>133. (iii) <i>Wrong view</i> as mental misconduct gives purpose to (?) wrong view, covetousness and ill will, and in one who has any wrong view at all, his misconduct (?), whether born of lust or born of hate, is all given being by wrong view. It is for this reason that wrong view aids misconduct in sensual desires. The speech-action it aids is gossip.</p>
<p>134.<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli40' href='#pts-vp-pli40'>PTS vp Pli 40</a> These are the three kinds of misconduct. As to the unprofitable roots: the covetousness is greed, the ill will is hate, and the wrong view is delusion. These aid the eight Wrongnesses. It is when these three unprofitable roots are curbed that the tenfold <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en51' href='#pts-vp-en51'>PTS vp En 51</a> profitable comes to fulfilment. From that threefold corruption by misconduct the type of Thread Dealing with Morality is the escape.</p>
<p>135. Herein, this demonstration is based on the plurality <span class='add'>[of covetousness, ill will, and wrong view; and]</span> it is in order for the greed, hate, and delusion also to correspond (?); that greed has prominence (pride of place) here for that reason; or else greed <span class='add'>[has it because it]</span> is <span class='add'>[normally so]</span> described among those <span class='add'>[three]</span> ideas <span class='add'>[considered as roots]</span>.</p>
<h4>2. Morality</h4>
<p>136. Herein, the unprofitable root delusion is ignorance. That has insisted on form in four ways: one who goes by ignorance (<i>sees form as self, or self possessing form, or form in self, or self in form</i>).</p>
<p>137. Herein, the first term in <span class='add'>[each of the four conjectures in]</span> the embodiment-view belongs with annihilationism <span class='add'>[in the following ways:]</span> (<i>The soul is what the physical frame is</i>), the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en52' href='#pts-vp-en52'>PTS vp En 52</a> no-existence <span class='add'>[of giving, etc.]</span> view, the fortuitous-arising view, and <span class='add'>[the view that]</span> (<i>one acts, another experiences</i> <span class='add'>[<i>the action's ripening</i>]</span>) . The last three terms of the self-conjectures in the Embodiment-View belong with eternalism <span class='add'>[in the following way:]</span> (<i>The soul is one, the physical frame another</i>), and the no-causists fall <span class='add'>[under this head]</span> because of the likelihood that the doctrine of no-ought-to-be-done will being suffering, and also the ineffectuality of actions, <span class='add'>[so (?)]</span> is included (?).</p>
<p>138. Herein, the live-out-the-soul-ists describe eighty-six (?) kinds of purification through the roundabout <span class='add'>[misapprehending it thus:]</span> (<i>Only this is true, the other is wrong</i>).</p>
<p>139. Herein, just as the embodiment-view has four grounds in form, so it has twenty grounds in <span class='add'>[all]</span> the five categories. The soul-is-another-ists belong with the eternalness of the embodiment-view and belong with the holders of the eternalist doctrine. They misapprehend virtue and duty <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli41' href='#pts-vp-pli41'>PTS vp Pli 41</a> thus: (<i>By means of this … I shall be some god or other</i>). This is misapprehension of virtue and duty.</p>
<p>140. Herein, in the embodiment-view (<i>he sees form as self</i>), and he doubts, is uncertain, disbelieves, is not confident, about whether (<i>the soul is what the physical frame is</i>) in the future period and in the past period: this is imperfection in one steadied in <span class='add'>[matters only]</span> dealing with morality.</p>
<h4>3a. Seeing</h4>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en53' href='#pts-vp-en53'>PTS vp En 53</a>141. Herein, he abandons all uncertainty by means of the faith faculty. He sees rise and subsidence by means of the understanding faculty. He gives cognizance singleness by means of the concentration faculty. He instigates by means of the energy faculty. By means of these five faculties, as a follower by Faith he arouses the straight-resulting concentration, since he is certain in the confidence that is due to undergoing; and by means of these faculties when purified, as a Follower by Ideas, he arouses the straight-resulting concentration owed to independence of others, (<i>he understands how it is that “This is Suffering”, …</i>), <span class='add'>[and so with the other three]</span> Truths.</p>
<p>This is the type of Thread Dealing with Seeing.</p>
<h4>3b. Keeping-in-Being</h4>
<p>142. Herein, of the five hither-side fetters, three fetters are abandonable by Seeing; <span class='add'>[while the other]</span> two <span class='add'>[are]</span> altogether abandoned when done by two person-types.</p>
<p>143. Herein, the three roots of unprofit abandonable by Keeping-in-Being, discarded <span class='add'>[in the progressively]</span> higher <span class='add'>[stages]</span>, still generate six kinds of being.</p>
<p>144. Herein, when among these <span class='add'>[three roots]</span> covetousness and ill will have been attenuated, and six kinds of being have come to <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en54' href='#pts-vp-en54'>PTS vp En 54</a> grips with exhaustion, while two kinds of being still remain. When this covetousness and ill will are altogether exhausted and  only one kind of being remains, that being is generated by conceit.</p>
<p>145. Now although here <span class='add'>[in the Arahant Path, which is the last stage of the Initiate]</span> there are also the other four <span class='add'>[further-side fetters besides conceit]</span>, namely the defilements of lust-for-form, lust-for-being, ignorance, and agitation, since these are given their being by conceit as positionality, all <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli42' href='#pts-vp-pli42'>PTS vp Pli 42</a> <span class='add'>[these seven kinds of Initiate]</span> have no power to stop the conceit “I am”, <span class='add'>[and so]</span> one should instigate the abandoning of the conceit “I am”. But he whose taints are exhausted <span class='add'>[by his reaching the Arahant's Fruit]</span> is beyond this.</p>
<h4>4. The Adept</h4>
<p>146. While the <span class='add'>[type of Thread]</span> Dealing with Seeing <span class='add'>[has regard]</span> to five kinds of Initiate persons, and the type of Thread Dealing with Keeping-in-Being <span class='add'>[has regard]</span> to three who are practising the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en55' href='#pts-vp-en55'>PTS vp En 55</a> way and two who stand in the fruit, beyond these there is the type of Thread Dealing with the Adept, which has regard to (?) the plane of Him Who Has Done, and this is the fifth type of Thread.</p>
<h4>The Ninefold Thread—General</h4>
<p>147. This Thread <span class='add'>[in general]</span> is taught of three types of persons: of the ordinary man, of the Initiate, and of the Adept. That Dealing with Corruption and that Dealing with Morality <span class='add'>[are taught]</span> of the ordinary man, that Dealing with Seeing and that Dealing with Keeping-in-Being of the five kinds of Initiates, and that Dealing with the Adept demonstrated last of all Arahants.</p>
<p>148. Now this <span class='add'>[Thread shown above as]</span> fivefold can be sought in the twenty-seven moods, its range being among those and not beyond them. Again with abbreviation: that <span class='add'>[Thread]</span> falls into fifty moods, which fifty moods demonstrated in the Dispensation, when abbreviated, fall into ten moods, which, while remaining in the presentation of the Noble Truths, fall into eight moods, that is, into the four <span class='add'>[unshared and four]</span> shared, which are the plane of the Modes of <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en56' href='#pts-vp-en56'>PTS vp En 56</a> Conveying in Combined Treatment. These when abbreviated fall into the five types of Threads, into that Dealing with Corruption, that Dealing with Morality, that Dealing with Seeing, that Dealing with Keeping-in-Being, and that Dealing with the Adept. These when abbreviated fall into the four types of Threads, into that Dealing with Corruption, that Dealing with Morality, that Dealing with Penetration, and that Dealing with the Adept. These when abbreviated fall into three types of Threads, into that Dealing with the Ordinary Man, that Dealing with the Initiate, and that Dealing with the Adept. These when abbreviated fall into two types of Threads, into that Dealing with Penetration and that Dealing with Previous Devotion, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli43' href='#pts-vp-pli43'>PTS vp Pli 43</a> according as it was said by the Blessed One: (<i>It is with two aims in view that Perfect Ones, arahants and fully enlightened, teach the True Idea, that is, Thread, song, … etc. … The Teachers</i> <span class='add'>[<i>do so</i>]</span> <i>conceiving that those possessed of previous devotion will easily attain mastery and conceiving that the previous devotion will</i> <span class='add'>[<i>conduce</i>]</span> <i>to creatures' remembering</i>).</p>
<p>149. Herein, bearing in mind the idiosyncrasies of one's own understanding in regard to the eightfold Thread-abbreviation, the construing can be done here and there wherever one is able, and after so construing <span class='add'>[the phrasing]</span> here and there, the Thread's meaning can then be demonstrated.</p>
<p>150. No one can demonstrate how the Thread's meaning is without having lent an ear (?).</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en57' href='#pts-vp-en57'>PTS vp En 57</a>151. Here is a mnemonic verse for the first Threads:
<blockquote class='gatha'>

</blockquote>
<p><span class='add'>[and]</span> the prose-exposition in the <i>Sevens</i>, namely (<i>When a bhikkhu possesses seven factors, then even were Himalaya King of Mountains to move … what need to speak of mere ignorance?</i>).</p>
<p>This is Means.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>
Now if thou art afraid of pain,<br>
And have no relish for the future;<br>
Like an umbrella in time of rain,</p>
<p>What purpose has the profitable?;<br>
<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli58' href='#pts-vp-pli58'>PTS vp Pli 58</a> And then not-self are all ideas,<br>
It would not move a man possessing;<br>
Thou wilt no safety find from pain,</p>
<p>And also quiet and insight too;<br>
Owing to lust for sense-desires<br>
He is devoured by his thoughts,<br>
Enlightenment Factors kept in being,</p>
<p>He the tangle disentangles;<br>
Then look upon the world as void,<br>
And keep in being concentration;<br>
If his desires when desiring,</p>
<p>Good destination from true conduct;<br>
Deformed as if pierced by a barb,<br>
Crushing from all the four directions;<br>
And also he that shuns desires,</p>
<p>The Pāricchattaka Simile;<br>
Whatever actions a man does,<br>
The worldly eight ideas displayed;<br>
And merit's ripening is pleasant,</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en74' href='#pts-vp-en74'>PTS vp En 74</a>No third alternative exists;<br>
Knowing the fear from that assuming,<br>
That is it born and that it dies;<br>
Sense-desires are many and varied,</p>
<p>The Simile of the Salt-Crystal;</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>For evil actions when performed,<br>
And he that goes by the bad ways;<br>
Whose faculties are truly quieted,</p>
<p>And the Noble (?) concentration (?);<br>
As pierced by a down-falling spear,<br>
When consciousness has a steadying-point;<br>
Someone who kills a breathing thing,</p>
<p>And then misconduct of three kinds<br>
Full sixty thousand years gone by,<br>
And difficult to find the moment;<br>
And as the stain upon the iron,</p>
<p>And in the four Right Practices;<br>
With faultless parts and a white awning,<br>
The Simile of the Cattle-Owner;<br>
Seclusion bliss for the contented,</p>
<p>And when the <span class='add'>[eight]</span> thoughts are well taught;<br>
The Simile of the Lump of Froth<br>
With clear eyes and bright countenance;<br>
Best in the world is understanding,</p>
<p>Three faculties with none besides;<br>

<p>And traces of the True Idea;<br>
<span class='add'>[Opposing none]</span> in words or mind,<br>
Impermanent five categories;<br>

He that shall practise in this way,</p>

No doing any kind of evil,<br>
Gateways to Liberation taught;<br>
There is no loved one like one's child,</p>
