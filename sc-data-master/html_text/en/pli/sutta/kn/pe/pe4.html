<h1>IV. Investigation of Threads</h1>

<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en95' href='#pts-vp-en95'>PTS vp En 95</a> <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli74' href='#pts-vp-pli74'>PTS vp Pli 74</a> 250. Herein, what is <i>Investigation of Threads</i>?</p>
<h2>I. Investigation and Construing of Threads by Profit and Unprofit</h2>
<p><span class='add'>[A Thread]</span> is thoroughly scrutinized as to the profitable and unprofitable ideas there according to consecutivity thus: “How then, did he instigate this Thread <span class='add'>[in its beginning]</span> … etc. …?  Is it construable with those Threads that are fully agreed upon, or is it not so construable”?</p>
<p>251. According as the Blessed One teaches defilement there in the beginning, it should be scrutinized as follows: “How then, is the abandoning of those defilements taught there <span class='add'>[too]</span> or is it not taught”? If it is not taught, then the profitable ideas <span class='add'>[which bring about the]</span> abandoning of those <span class='add'>[defilements]</span> must be sought in the <span class='add'>[kind of divine life lived under the]</span> Blessed One (?).</p>
<p>252. If, in searching, one does not find where those unprofitable ideas come to <span class='add'>[their]</span> abandonment, then those unprofitable ideas must be reserved <span class='add'>[and]</span> inquired into <span class='add'>[further, taking the type of Thread in this case to be]</span> that Dealing with Corruption <span class='add'>[where no profit is explicitly taught]</span>.</p>
<p>253. If, when the defilements—or any one of them—are thus reserved, they <span class='add'>[still]</span> do not give the construing, <span class='add'>[then]</span> the ideas <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en96' href='#pts-vp-en96'>PTS vp En 96</a> belonging to the noble paths must be scrutinized as follows: “Do these <span class='add'>[particular]</span> defilements come to abandonment in these <span class='add'>[particular]</span> planes, <span class='add'>[namely those of Seeing and Keeping-in-Being]</span> or do they not”? Now a certain <span class='add'>[specific]</span> number of defilements may be taught, <span class='add'>[e.g., the ten fetters,]</span> without any correspondingly equal number of noble ideas being taught, <span class='add'>[e.g., the four paths]</span> So wherever <span class='add'>[on the level of any one of the four paths.]</span> any defilements come to <span class='add'>[their]</span> abandonment, any defilements <span class='add'>[so far]</span> not construable as opposites of noble ideas there <span class='add'>[in that particular plane, say, that of Seeing,]</span> must be reserved.</p>
<p>254. If, when they are <span class='add'>[thus]</span> reserved, they give the construction, <span class='add'>[still that Thread]</span> must be inquired into herein <span class='add'>[in regard to those defilements]</span> as follows: “Do two or three or more defilements come to <span class='add'>[their]</span> abandonment by means of any single Path”?</p>
<p>255. If, when thus inquired into, they give the construction, <span class='add'>[then that Thread]</span> must be scrutinized therein <span class='add'>[in regard to those defilements]</span> as follows: “What is the Thread's meaning and what is not its meaning according to the traditional <span class='add'>[interpretation]</span> or by what is given in the texts”?</p>
<p>256. Or even if not capable of <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli75' href='#pts-vp-pli75'>PTS vp Pli 75</a> being demonstrated in this way, <span class='add'>[still]</span> the Thread need not <span class='add'>[on that account alone]</span> be the object of uncertainty, <span class='add'>[rather it should be further investigated]</span> according as to whether the ideas in the beginning are profitable <span class='add'>[instead of unprofitable]</span>.</p>
<p>257. Whatever the defilements, they must be scrutinized as to how they are abandonable, whether the profitable comes first or whether it is arrived at through its opposite's coming first. The teaching must be taken as having nothing lacking or superfluous.</p>
<p>258. Just as <span class='add'>[in the case of]</span> the first statement, <span class='add'>[namely <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en97' href='#pts-vp-en97'>PTS vp En 97</a> that of defilement's coming first,]</span> now <span class='add'>[again]</span> any noble ideas taught <span class='add'>[for the abandoning]</span> of any defilements must be investigated as to whether they are abandoned by these <span class='add'>[particular]</span> noble ideas or not. If, when so scrutinized, they are construable, then they can be accepted <span class='add'>[as such]</span>; but <span class='add'>[if]</span> they are not <span class='add'>[so]</span> construable, then any defilements that are not opposites <span class='add'>[of those particular noble ideas]</span> cannot be opposed to them. For noble ideas do not arrive at the abandonment of defilements that are future <span class='add'>[to them]</span>. Neither does <span class='add'>[any]</span> noble idea <span class='add'>[alone indiscriminately]</span> bring about the abandoning of all defilements. As <span class='add'>[for example]</span>, while loving-kindness is profitable and lust unprofitable, <span class='add'>[yet]</span> taking loving-kindness as profitable does not bring about the abandoning of lust; it is <span class='add'>[in fact]</span> ill will <span class='add'>[not lust]</span> that comes to abandonment by means of loving-kindness. So both sorts of defilement have to be scrutinized, and any idea <span class='add'>[so]</span> disclosed, whether profitable or unprofitable, must be reserved. If these <span class='add'>[namely ill will and lust in this case]</span> are construed when reserved, then there is nothing <span class='add'>[more]</span> to be scrutinized. Either the two defilements may be abandonable by the one noble idea, or else either one of the <span class='add'>[two]</span> defilements may be abandonable by two noble ideas <span class='add'>[successively]</span>.</p>
<p>259. Or alternatively, also when <span class='add'>[only]</span> one, on being scrutinized, is construed, herein it must be inquired into how it is construed, <span class='add'>[namely by which noble idea,]</span> or it must be inquired into why it is that the Thread cannot be demonstrated; for no Thread must remain an object of uncertainty.</p>
<p>260.<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli76' href='#pts-vp-pli76'>PTS vp Pli 76</a> Any defilement's lapse when any noble ideas that are <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en98' href='#pts-vp-en98'>PTS vp En 98</a> taught must be scrutinized in both the ways <span class='add'>[indicated above for Loving-kindness as follows]</span>: It seems (?) that these <span class='add'>[particular]</span> defilements are taught in <span class='add'>[this]</span> verse or prose-exposition: How then, are these defilements abandoned by these noble ideas or are they not? Or <span class='add'>[conversely]</span> do these noble ideas lead to the abandonment of these defilements? <span class='add'>[For]</span> although unprofitable ideas do come to abandonment by means of profitable ideas, still not all unprofitable ideas come to abandonment <span class='add'>[indiscriminately]</span> by means of any profitable ideas <span class='add'>[indiscriminately]</span>. As <span class='add'>[for example]</span> while Loving-kindness is profitable and lust unprofitable, yet, taking Loving-kindness as profitable and lust as unprofitable, lust does not come to abandonment by means of Loving-kindness; it is <span class='add'>[in fact]</span> ill will <span class='add'>[not lust]</span> that comes to abandonment by means of loving-kindness. Consequently <span class='add'>[defilement]</span> does not come to abandonment in a <span class='add'>[given]</span> Thread <span class='add'>[simply]</span> by taking it as ‘defilement’ <span class='add'>[indiscriminately]</span>, nor, <span class='add'>[simply]</span> by taking a <span class='add'>[profitable]</span> idea in a <span class='add'>[given]</span> Thread, <span class='add'>[in this case Loving-kindness]</span>, does that lead to the abandonment of all defilements <span class='add'>[indiscrimimately]</span>. In fact, it is <span class='add'>[only when]</span> a noble idea <span class='add'>[belonging]</span> to a <span class='add'>[particular]</span> Thread is a defilement's opposite that that <span class='add'>[defilement]</span> comes to be abandoned by means of that <span class='add'>[noble idea]</span>”.</p>
<p>261. Herein, when the profitable taught in a <span class='add'>[particular verse]</span> or prose-exposition in the Thread and the corruptions <span class='add'>[taught there]</span> do not construe—or the noble ideas <span class='add'>[do not construe]</span>—these should be reserved in accordance with the parts <span class='add'>[of the formula for scrutinizing]</span> demonstrable in the Principal Appeals to Authority.</p>
<p>262. Herein, if, with the defilements taught—and with that noble idea among the noble ideas—those defilements do come to abandonment, <span class='add'>[then]</span> it should also be scrutinized as follows: “In which <span class='add'>[Path-]</span>function are these defilements abandonable? In which <span class='add'>[Path-]</span>function are these noble ideas taught? In whichever mood <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en99' href='#pts-vp-en99'>PTS vp En 99</a> <span class='add'>[that is, as Seeing or as one of the stages of Keeping-in-Being]</span> the noble ideas are taught, that is the aspect in which this defilement stands <span class='add'>[in relation thereto]</span>. For there is one defilement abandonable by only one noble idea, not in any other way: while view and lust are abandonable by Seeing <span class='add'>[in the first Path]</span>, not so ignorance <span class='add'>[which is only abandonable by Arahantship]</span>. And if ignorance or ideas belonging to the plane of Keeping-in-Being <span class='add'>[i.e. the last three paths and second and third fruits]</span> are abandonable in this way <span class='add'>[regarded collectively under “Keeping-in-Being”]</span>, it is precisely that <span class='add'>[ignorance]</span>, which belongs to the further side <span class='add'>[fetters]</span>, which is abandoned through the kind of non-attention that is due to the deliverance's signless <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli77' href='#pts-vp-pli77'>PTS vp Pli 77</a> heart-concentration for the purpose (?) of seeing the undetermined.</p>
<p>263. That is how the Thread should be scrutinized <span class='add'>[in order to verify]</span> that it is (<i>with its meaning and with its phrasing</i> ). When defilements are <span class='add'>[of the kind]</span> abandonable by Seeing, then the noble idea is taught in the mood of Seeing, when <span class='add'>[they are of the kind]</span> abandonable by Keeping-in-Being, then the noble idea is taught in the mood of Keeping-in-Being. When <span class='add'>[of the kind]</span> abandonable by <span class='add'>[right]</span> use <span class='add'>[of the four requisites of the bhikkhu's life]</span>, then the noble idea is taught in the mood of <span class='add'>[right]</span> use; and so on from those abandonable by removal down to the <span class='add'>[end of the Thread dealing with the]</span> seven kinds of taints, which can be quoted.</p>
<p>264. In so far as this <span class='add'>[defilement]</span> idea is abandonable in the various other stages <span class='add'>[than that of Seeing]</span>, the noble idea <span class='add'>[will be appropriately]</span> taught in another mood, <span class='add'>[and so]</span> that noble idea must be sought otherwise <span class='add'>[according to the mood]</span>. If this <span class='add'>[defilement-]</span>idea gives the construing for one when one is seeking it <span class='add'>[thus]</span>, then in <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en100' href='#pts-vp-en100'>PTS vp En 100</a> whichever mood that noble idea can be sought out, that is the mood in which the <span class='add'>[particular]</span> defilement is abandoned. <span class='add'>[And so]</span> that <span class='add'>[noble idea]</span> must be scrutinized therein <span class='add'>[with respect to the seven moods mentioned above]</span>. Then if it still does not construe, the <span class='add'>[meaning of the actual]</span> Thread <span class='add'>[itself]</span> which is being sought out by means of that <span class='add'>[already]</span> tested <span class='add'>[other]</span> Thread must be inquired into, <span class='add'>[and]</span> in so far as it is construable it can be accepted, but in so far as it is not construable it cannot be accepted: (<i>Certainly this was not spoken by the Blessed One, or it has been wrongly taken by the venerable one</i>), which is demonstrable according to the <span class='add'>[prescribed way of searching (testing) in the]</span> Principal Appeals to Authority. What is taught by the Blessed One is according to how things are.</p>
<h2>II. Investigation and Construing of Threads by Conditions</h2>
<p>265. Whatever the idea taught, profitable as well as unprofitable, that idea's condition must be sought out; for no idea arises unconditioned, without a condition.</p>
<p>266. Herein, what is the mood for the search? Herein, this Thread <span class='add'>[to be sought]</span> must be inquired into as to whether this idea <span class='add'>[in question]</span> has been stated with the cause and with the condition appropriate thereto.</p>
<p>267. And the condition is of three kinds: slight, medium, and outstanding. Herein, when the condition is slight, the idea <span class='add'>[conditioned]</span> must be taken as slight. That being so, this condition is <span class='add'>[again]</span> of two kinds: condition in remote relation and condition in immediate proximity.</p>
<p>268. When the condition is slight, what is unoutstanding owing to it must be sought. What is the reason? <span class='add'>[It may be that]</span> a <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en101' href='#pts-vp-en101'>PTS vp En 101</a> certain condition comes to occurrence (?) or fulfilment through other conditions. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli78' href='#pts-vp-pli78'>PTS vp Pli 78</a> Herein, whatever the idea taught <span class='add'>[in this Thread that is being scrutinized]</span>, the cause of that must be sought either through that <span class='add'>[idea]</span> or through a.</p>
<p>269. <span class='add'>[And]</span> like the condition, the outcome of that idea must be sought by cause and by condition. That condition should be sought in the way that one seeks <span class='add'>[how]</span> the basic state was demonstrated in the terms of expression <span class='add'>[of the particular Thread]</span>; for there is no slight idea that has an outstanding outcome, nor does any outstanding outcome have a slight <span class='add'>[condition-]</span>idea. If the slight is construable of the slight, the medium of the medium, and the outstanding of the outstanding, that can be accepted. <span class='add'>[But]</span> if it does not <span class='add'>[so]</span> construe, it cannot be accepted.</p>
<p>270. And whatever idea the Blessed One instigates <span class='add'>[initially]</span> in order to teach <span class='add'>[a particular teaching]</span>, that he teaches also in the middle and the end <span class='add'>[of it]</span>: he demonstrates in the beginning the idea according as <span class='add'>[it is given]</span> in the terms of expression <span class='add'>[of that particular teaching, and]</span> only that idea <span class='add'>[appears]</span> much <span class='add'>[in it]</span> and is that Thread's end; for it is in virtue of that idea that that Thread comes to be such <span class='add'>[as it is in type]</span>, whether verse or prose-exposition, whether small or large.</p>
<p>271. But as the fixing is twofold, namely fixing that is in conformity as well as fixing the <span class='add'>[actual]</span> teaching, <span class='add'>[the fixing]</span> of that idea must also be sought (tested) as to whether it is in conformity <span class='add'>[with other Threads]</span>. And just as the restraining of the five faculties <span class='add'>[of the eye, etc.,]</span> taught by the Blessed One, in having for its purpose the curbing of craving, teaches that <span class='add'>[that idea]</span> conveys his <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en102' href='#pts-vp-en102'>PTS vp En 102</a> wish as in the simile of the <i>Cattle-herd Thread</i> <span class='add'>[in the <i>Anguttara</i>]</span>, <span class='add'>[when tested]</span> also by means of other Threads that the Blessed One has uttered, <span class='add'>[namely]</span> the thought (?) in the Majjhima Nikāya, it conveys his wish. This is what is in conformity with the Blessed One's teaching. So this idea has to be sought also in other prose-expositions; for it cannot be regarded <span class='add'>[as sought out]</span> in <span class='add'>[only]</span> a single Thread. When it construes, it can be accepted.</p>
<h2>III. Investigation and Construing by the Blessed One's Agreement</h2>
<p>272. Herein, what is the <i>agreed</i>?</p>
<p><span class='add'>[When]</span> any Thread whatever is not uttered by the Blessed One and that <span class='add'>[Thread]</span> is found among the Threads too, <span class='add'>[then]</span> according as it is uttered by whomsoever it may be, so it should be borne in mind.</p>
<p>273. That Thread must be inquired into as follows: “How then, does this <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli79' href='#pts-vp-pli79'>PTS vp Pli 79</a> Thread allow of the Blessed One's agreement or does it not allow of his agreement”? And some Threads allow of the Blessed One's agreement and some Threads do not allow of his agreement. When someone teaches what is the Ten Powered One's province, <span class='add'>[doing so]</span> altogether without giving a way of entry <span class='add'>[to the main ideas in his teaching]</span>, that Thread does not allow of the Blessed One's agreement. But there is also the kind of hearer who knows the Ten Powered One's province, <span class='add'>[doing so]</span> either limitedly or unlimitedly, yet he does not know that power <span class='add'>[itself]</span> at all beyond the hearing <span class='add'>[of it]</span>; as <span class='add'>[for instance, in the case of]</span> the divine exhorted by the venerable Sāriputta. Now that venerable one had no Knowledge of Variety in Faculties and Powers, hence by his not knowing the Encompassing of <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en103' href='#pts-vp-en103'>PTS vp En 103</a> <span class='add'>[Other]</span> Persons, while <span class='add'>[the divine]</span> had more he could still have done <span class='add'>[i.e. by attaining the Noble Path]</span>, he was made to reappear <span class='add'>[after death in the world of High Divinity, and so the venerable Sāriputta]</span> was not congratulated by the Blessed One. And as <span class='add'>[for instance, in the case of]</span> the venerable Mahā-Kassapa when he advised his nephew, <span class='add'>[though]</span> he <span class='add'>[the nephew]</span> was possessed of <span class='add'>[unprofitable]</span> action ripening straightway <span class='add'>[upon rebirth, the Elder]</span> lighting a finger by a feat of supernormal power; <span class='add'>[but since]</span> no knowledge of how things are by cause and instance in the case of all Undertaking of Action existed in that venerable one, hence the Blessed One advised him, saying:
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Even, O Kassapa, if thou<br>
Wilt carry ten such luminaries,<br>
Not even then will he see forms:<br>
That eye does not exist in him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='add'>[And again]</span> like a messenger who informs a creature of the king's word, so the <span class='add'>[mere]</span> emulator teaches to others speech he does not <span class='add'>[himself]</span> understand.</p>
<p>A Thread which has the agreed approval can be accepted; that which has not the agreed approval cannot be accepted.</p>
<h2>IV. Confusion of Threads</h2>
<p>274. Herein, what is <i>Mixing-Up of Threads</i>?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli80' href='#pts-vp-pli80'>PTS vp Pli 80</a> The Thread is fivefold: (1) the type of Thread Dealing with Corruption, (2) the type of Thread Dealing with Morality, (3a) the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en104' href='#pts-vp-en104'>PTS vp En 104</a> type of Thread Dealing with Seeing, (3b) the type of Thread Dealing with Keeping-in-Being, and (4) the type of Thread Dealing with the Adept. <span class='add'>[If]</span> one type would requite, he teaches another, and he demonstrates in one type of Thread the meaning of another type of Thread. Or he demonstrates a Thread's meaning in several moods <span class='add'>[and]</span> in the establishing of the <span class='add'>[particular]</span> noble idea <span class='add'>[taught there]</span> he divulges a meaning not there (?). He demonstrates in those dealing with Seeing the meaning of one dealing with Morality. He demonstrates in the further-side <span class='add'>[fetters]</span> the meaning of higher-side fetters. He demonstrates in Threads <span class='add'>[dealing]</span> with outstanding <span class='add'>[faculties (?) the meaning]</span> of those <span class='add'>[dealing]</span> with blunt and medium faculties (?).</p>
<p>275. So this Thread is <span class='add'>[thus]</span> broken up <span class='add'>[by him]</span>. The breaking up as to cause, outcome and fruit , as to the blunt, medium and outstanding state, and as to meaning and phrasing, is what is called “Mixing-Up of Threads”. The non-breaking-up is what is called “Investigation of Threads”.</p>
<p>276. Herein, this is a mnemonic verse:
<ol type='i'>
<li>Untornness of the first, and then</li>
<li>Condition for what comes to be,  And Outcome with with Morality,</li>
<li>Agreement, and then (iv) Thread-Mixing-Up.</li>
</ol>
