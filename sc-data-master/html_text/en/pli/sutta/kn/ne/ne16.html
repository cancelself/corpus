<h3>13. The Ninefold Thread in the Mode of Conveying a Clearing-Up</h3>
<p>414. Herein, what is the Mode of Conveying a Clearing-Up? <span class='add'>[It is stated in]</span> the verse:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Seeking<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en101' href='#pts-vp-en101'>PTS vp En 101</a> if in a question answered<br>
What in the verse did instigate<br>
Its asking is cleared up or not:<br>
This Mode Conveys a Clearing-Up”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>415. For instance, in the <i>Parāyana</i> <span class='add'>[Chapter of the <i>Suttanipāta</i>]</span> the venerable Ajita asked the Blessed One the question <span class='add'>[and received the answer thus:]</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“<span class='add'>[Tell]</span> what is the world shut in by?<br>
And wherefore is it not displayed?<br>
And what is it besmeared with? Say.<br>
And what will be its greatest fear”?</p>
<p>“By ignorance is the world shut in,<br>
Ajita” the Blessed One said.<br>
“’Tis undisplayed through miswishing and neglect.<br>
And hankering smears it, I say.<br>
Suffering is its greatest fear”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>416. In the case of the question “<span class='add'>[Tell]</span> what is the world shut in by”? the Blessed One <span class='add'>[with his answer]</span> “By ignorance is the world shut in” clears up a term but not the instigation. In the case of the question “And wherefore is it not <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli71' href='#pts-vp-pli71'>PTS vp Pli 71</a> displayed”? The Blessed One <span class='add'>[with his answer]</span> “’Tis undisplayed through miswishing and neglect” clears up a term but not the instigation. In the case of the question “And what is it besmeared with? Say” the Blessed One <span class='add'>[with his answer]</span> “And hankering smears it, I say” clears up a term but not the instigation. <span class='add'>[But]</span> in the case of the question “And what will be its greatest fear”? the Blessed One <span class='add'>[with his answer]</span> “Suffering is its greatest fear” clears up a term, and the instigation is cleared up too.</p>
<p>That is why the Blessed One said “By ignorance is the world shut in …”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en102' href='#pts-vp-en102'>PTS vp En 102</a>417.<span class='add'>[Again there are the following question and answer:]</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The streams keep streaming everywhere”<br>
So said the venerable Ajita.<br>
“What is it that shuts off the streams?<br>
Tell then, what is restraint of streams,<br>
Whereby it is that streams are sealed”?</p>
<p>“Whatever streams are in the world,<br>
Ajita” the Blessed One said<br>
“They are shut off by mindfulness;<br>
The streams’ restraint I tell, whereby<br>
They can be sealed, is understanding”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>418. In the case of the question “The streams keep streaming everywhere; What is it that shuts off the streams”? the Blessed One <span class='add'>[with his answer]</span> “Whatever streams are in the world, They are shut off by mindfulness” clears up a term but not the instigation. In the case of the question “Tell then, what is restraint of streams, Whereby it is that streams are sealed”? <span class='add'>[with the answer]</span> “the streams’ restraint I tell, whereby They can be sealed, is understanding” the instigation is cleared up.</p>
<p>That is why the Blessed One said “Whatever streams are in the world …”.</p>
<p>419. <span class='add'>[Again,]</span> in the case of the question</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Understanding and mindfulness”.<br>
So said the venerable Ajita<br>
“And <span class='add'>[now]</span>, good sir, this name-and-form,<br>
Tell me then what I ask of you,<br>
Where does it came to its surcease”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='add'>[with the answer]</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“As to the question that you ask,<br>
Ajita, I <span class='add'>[shall]</span> tell you <span class='add'>[now]</span>.<br>
Where both this name and form do come<br>
To their remainderless surcease:<br>
With cessation of consciousness,<br>
’Tis here this comes to its surcease”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the instigation is cleared up.</p>
<p>That <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en103' href='#pts-vp-en103'>PTS vp En 103</a> is why the Blessed One said “As to the question that you ask …”</p>
<p>420. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli72' href='#pts-vp-pli72'>PTS vp Pli 72</a> Wherever the instigation is cleared up in this way the question is answered; but wherever the instigation is not cleared up that question is not yet answered.</p>
<p>421. That is why the venerable Mahā-Kaccāna said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Seeking if in a question answered<br>
What in the verse did instigate<br>
Its asking is cleared up or not:<br>
This Mode Conveys a Clearing-Up”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class='end'>The Mode of Conveying a Clearing-Up is ended.</p>
