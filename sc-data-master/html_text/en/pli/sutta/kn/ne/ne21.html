<h1>4. Chapter ii 16 Modes of Conveying: Combined Treatment (Continued)</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>[2]</span></p>
<p>505. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli87' href='#pts-vp-pli87'>PTS vp Pli 87</a> Herein, what is the Mode of Conveying an Investigation in Combined Treatment? <span class='add'>[It is, for example, as follows.]</span></p>
<p>506. Herein, craving is of two kinds: profitable and unprofitable. While the unprofitable kind goes with the roundabout, the profitable kind is craving for abandoning, which goes with dispersal.</p>
<p>507. Also conceit is of two kinds: profitable and unprofitable. Any conceit supported by which one abandons conceit is profitable; but any conceit which makes suffering occur is unprofitable conceit.</p>
<p>508. Herein, <span class='add'>[as an example]</span> in the case of the grief that has for its support the renunciation <span class='add'>[described thus]</span> (“<i>When shall I enter upon by verification and abide in that base, which peaceful base the Noble Ones enter upon by verification and abide in”?, and longing arises in him, and grief with the longing as its condition</i>): such craving is profitable; for there being the heart-deliverance due to fading of lust, <span class='add'>[such craving]</span> is profitable in having that for its object.</p>
<p>509. <span class='add'>[Now there is also]</span> the understanding-deliverance due to fading of ignorance what is <span class='add'>[the basis for]</span> investigation of that?</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>Investigation of the Eight-factored Path</i>]</span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en122' href='#pts-vp-en122'>PTS vp En 122</a>510.<span class='add'>[The basis for that is]</span> the eight path factors: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
<p>511. Where is <span class='add'>[an example of investigation of]</span> that to be found? In <span class='add'>[as the most outstanding instance]</span> the perfection of the fourth meditation. For in the fourth meditation cognizance is kept in being possessed of eight factors: it is quite purified, quite bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability. He <span class='add'>[who has attained this perfection of the fourth meditation]</span> then arrives at an eightfold <span class='add'>[state]</span>, namely the Six kinds of Acquaintanceship <span class='add'>[with supernormal power]</span> and the Two Distinctions, <span class='add'>[that is, the Mind-Made Body and Insight-Knowledge]</span>.</p>
<p>512. When that cognizance is quite purified it is quite bright; when quite bright, unblemished; when unblemished, rid of imperfections; when rid of imperfections, malleable; when malleable, wieldy; when wieldy, steady; when steady, it is attained to imperturbability.</p>
<p>513. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli88' href='#pts-vp-pli88'>PTS vp Pli 88</a> Herein, blemish and imperfection both belong to the side of craving, and any perturbation and unsteadiness of cognizance belong to the side of views.</p>
<p>514. Four faculties—namely the <span class='add'>[bodily]</span> pain faculty, the <span class='add'>[mental]</span> grief faculty, the <span class='add'>[bodily]</span> pleasure faculty, and the <span class='add'>[mental]</span> joy faculty, cease in the fourth meditation. In that the onlooking-equanimity faculty is left. This <span class='add'>[meditator]</span> gives attention to the <span class='add'>[next]</span> higher attainment as <span class='add'>[more]</span> peaceful. When he gives attention to the <span class='add'>[next]</span> higher attainment as <span class='add'>[more]</span> peaceful, his perception of grossness shapes itself to the fourth meditation and his perception of resistance reaches upwards <span class='add'>[to something better]</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en123' href='#pts-vp-en123'>PTS vp En 123</a>515. With complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and with no attention to perceptions of difference, <span class='add'>[aware that]</span> “Space is infinite”, he enters upon by realization and abides in the attainment of the base consisting of infiniteness of space.</p>
<p>516. The directive management <span class='add'>[of cognizance]</span> in the kinds of acquaintanceship <span class='add'>[with supernormal power]</span> is perception of form; the constituting <span class='add'>[of diversity]</span> is perception of difference. He surmounts <span class='add'>[these]</span> and his perception of resistance disappears.</p>
<p>517. Such is concentration. When he is concentrated, his illumination vanishes and also his seeing of forms.</p>
<p>518. That <span class='add'>[kind of]</span> concentration can be reviewed as possessing six factors: “(1) My notion of all the world is accompanied by non-covetousness; (2) my cognizance of all creatures is unaffected by ill-will, (3) my energy is instigated and exerted, (4) my body is tranquillized and uninstigated, (5) my cognizance is concentrated and undistracted, (6) my mindfulness is established and unforgotten”.</p>
<p>519. Herein, any notion unaccompanied by covetousness about all the world, and any cognizance of all creatures unaffected by ill-will, and any energy instigated and exerted, and any concentrated undistracted cognizance: these are Quiet. <span class='add'>[But]</span> the tranquillized body remaining uninstigated is the requisite for concentration, and the mindfulness established unforgettingly is Insight.</p>
<p>520. That <span class='add'>[kind of]</span> concentration can be understood in five ways as follows: (1) “This concentration has presently-arisen pleasure”: this is how his knowing and seeing are manifested in himself. And “this concentration has future pleasant ripening”: this is how his knowing and seeing are manifested in himself. (2) “This concentration is noble and unmaterialistic”: this is how <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli89' href='#pts-vp-pli89'>PTS vp Pli 89</a> his knowing and seeing are manifested in himself. (3) “This concentration is not cultivated by trivial men”: this is how his knowing and seeing are manifested in himself. (4) “This concentration is both the <span class='add'>[most]</span> peaceful and the superior <span class='add'>[goal]</span>, and it has gained tranquillity and arrived at singleness and does not have to be protected <span class='add'>[from defilement]</span> with the deterrence of prompting determinations”: <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en124' href='#pts-vp-en124'>PTS vp En 124</a> this is how his knowing and seeing are manifested in himself. (5) “Now I attain this concentration mindful and emerge from it mindful”: this is how his knowing and seeing are manifested in himself.</p>
<p>521. Herein, any concentration that has presently-arisen pleasure and any concentration that has future pleasant ripening are Quiet. And any concentration that is noble and unmaterialistic, and any concentration that is not cultivated by trivial men, and any concentration that is the <span class='add'>[most]</span> peaceful and the superior <span class='add'>[goal]</span> and has gained tranquillity and has arrived at singleness and does not have to be protected <span class='add'>[from defilement]</span> with the deterrence of prompting determinations, and any <span class='add'>[concentration of which one is aware]</span> “Now I am in attainment of this concentration mindful, and I emerge from it mindful”, are Insight.</p>
<p>522. That concentration can be understood <span class='add'>[again]</span> in five ways <span class='add'>[as follows]</span>: extension of happiness, extension of pleasure, extension of cognizance, extension of light, and the sign of concentration.</p>
<p>523. Herein, any extension of happiness, any extension of pleasure, any extension of cognizance, are Quiet, while any extension of light, and any extension of reviewing, are Insight.</p>
<p>524. There are the ten bases of wholeness: wholeness of earth (solidity), wholeness of water (cohesion), wholeness of fire (temperature), wholeness of air (force); wholeness of blue-black, wholeness of yellow, wholeness of red, wholeness of white; wholeness of space, and wholeness of consciousness.</p>
<p>525. Herein, the wholeness of earth … down to … the wholeness of white: these eight wholenesses are quiet, while the wholeness of space and the wholeness of consciousness are insight.</p>
<p>526. In this way the whole Noble Path, in whatever way it is stated, can be construed accordingly as Quiet and Insight.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en125' href='#pts-vp-en125'>PTS vp En 125</a>527.<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli90' href='#pts-vp-pli90'>PTS vp Pli 90</a> These <span class='add'>[ideas]</span> are comprised by three ideas: by impermanence, by painfulness, and by not-self.</p>
<p>528. <span class='add'>[Consequently,]</span> when he keeps in being quiet and insight, he keeps in being the three Gateways to Liberation. When he keeps in being the three gateways to liberation, he keeps in being the three categories <span class='add'>[of virtue, concentration, and understanding]</span>. When he keeps in being the three categories, he keeps in being the Noble Eight-factored Path.</p>
<p>529. A person of lusting temperament finds outlet by the signless gateway to liberation, training by the training in higher cognizance, abandoning greed as a root of unprofit, not approaching contact to be felt as pleasant, diagnosing pleasant feeling, washing out the stain of lust, shaking off the dust of lust, vomiting forth the poison of lust, extinguishing the fire of lust, extracting the barb of lust, and disentangling the tangle of lust.</p>
<p>530. A person of hating temperament finds outlet by the dispositionless gateway to liberation, training by the training in higher virtue, abandoning hate as a root of unprofit, not approaching contact to be felt as painful, diagnosing painful feeling, washing out the stain of hate, shaking off the dirt of hate, vomiting forth the poison of hate, extinguishing the fire of hate, extracting the barb of hate, and disentangling the tangle of hate.</p>
<p>531. A person of deluded temperament finds outlet by the void gateway to liberation, training by the training in higher understanding, abandoning delusion as a root of unprofit, not approaching contact to be felt as neither-painful-nor-pleasant, diagnosing neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, washing out the stain of delusion, shaking off the dirt of delusion, vomiting forth the poison of delusion, extinguishing the fire of delusion, extracting the barb of delusion, and disentangling the tangle of delusion.</p>
<p>532. Herein, the void gateway to liberation is the understanding category, the signless gateway to liberation is the concentration category, and the dispositionless gateway to liberation is the virtue category. When he keeps in being the three gateways to liberation, he keeps in being the three categories, and when he keeps in <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en126' href='#pts-vp-en126'>PTS vp En 126</a> being the three categories he keeps in being the Noble Eight-factored Path.</p>
<p>533. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli91' href='#pts-vp-pli91'>PTS vp Pli 91</a> Herein, right speech, right action, and right livelihood, are the virtue category; right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration, are the concentration category; right view, and right intention, are the understanding category.</p>
<p>534. Herein, the virtue category and the concentration category are quiet, while the understanding category is insight.</p>
<p>535. When anyone keeps in being quiet and insight, two factors of being are kept in being in him, namely, the body and cognizance; and the way leading to the cessation of being is the two basic stages, namely virtue and concentration. This bhikkhu has kept the body in being, kept virtue in being, kept <span class='add'>[concentrated]</span> cognizance in being, and kept understanding in being.</p>
<p>536. While the body is kept in being, two ideas also are kept in being, namely right action and right effort. While virtue is kept in being, two ideas also are kept in being, namely right speech and right livelihood. While <span class='add'>[concentrated]</span> cognizance is kept in being, two ideas also are kept in being, namely right mindfulness and right concentration. While understanding is kept in being, two ideas also are kept in being, namely right view and right intention.</p>
<p>537. Herein, the right action and the right effort may be bodily and may be mental.</p>
<p>538. Herein, what is comprised within the body is also kept in being when the body is kept in being, and what is comprised within the mental is also kept in being when <span class='add'>[concentrated]</span> cognizance is kept in being.</p>
<p>539. When he keeps in being quiet and insight, he arrives at the fivefold arrival: there is arrival at quickness, there is arrival at deliverance, there is arrival at greatness, there is arrival at abundance, and there is arrival at remainderlessness.</p>
<p>540. Herein, arrival at quickness and arrival at greatness and arrival at abundance come about through quiet, while arrival at deliverance and arrival at remainderlessness come about through insight.</p>

He <span class='add'>[gives advice]</span> in three ways: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli92' href='#pts-vp-pli92'>PTS vp Pli 92</a> Do this; do it by this means; when that is done it will be for your welfare and pleasure.</p>

<p>551. Knowledge as to cause and as to instance about this unlimitedly is called the Perfect One’s first Power consisting in knowledge of Instance and Non-Instance.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>ii. Knowledge of the Way that Leads Anywhere</i>]</span></p>
<p>552. All who come under the Instance and Non-Instance <span class='add'>[just mentioned]</span> are inseparable from the idea of exhaustion, from the idea of subsidence, from the idea of fading, from the idea of ceasing; some pass on to heaven, some pass on to states of unease, some pass on to extinction. This is why the Blessed One said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>All creatures will <span class='add'>[most surely]</span> die<br>
Because the end of life is death.<br>
According to their acts they go<br>
<span class='add'>[Reaping]</span> merit’s and evil’s fruits:<br>
Evil-doers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell;<br>
Merit-makers pass on to heaven;<br>
Others maintain the path in being<br>
And find extinction free from taints.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>553.“All creatures” noble and ignoble; those included in embodiment and those beyond embodiment. “Will die” by the two kinds of death, namely by sluggish death and by non-sluggish death. Non-sluggish death is that of those included in embodiment and sluggish death is that of those beyond embodiment. “Because the end of life is death”: the complete ending of life, the complete ending by death, <span class='add'>[comes]</span> with exhaustion of the life-span, with surcease of the faculties. “According to their acts they go” <span class='add'>[means]</span> ownership of action. “<span class='add'>[Reaping]</span> merit’s and evil’s fruits” <span class='add'>[means]</span> the state of seeing the fruits of acts and non-<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en131' href='#pts-vp-en131'>PTS vp En 131</a>separation <span class='add'>[from them]</span>. Those who have made determinations of demerit, being “evil-doers, <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell” while “merit-makers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to heaven”: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli95' href='#pts-vp-pli95'>PTS vp Pli 95</a> those who have <span class='add'>[made]</span> determinations of merit will go to a good destination. “Others maintain the path in being And find extinction free from taints” <span class='add'>[means]</span> the surmounting of all determinations. That is why the Blessed One said “All creatures … extinction free from taints”.</p>
<p>554.“All creatures will <span class='add'>[most surely]</span> die Because the end of life is death. According to their acts they go <span class='add'>[Reaping]</span> merit’s and evil’s fruits: Evil-doers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell” is the <span class='add'>[two extreme]</span> ways of luxury and of penance. “Others maintain the path in being And find extinction free from taints” is the middle way.</p>
<p>555.“All creatures will <span class='add'>[most surely]</span> die Because the end of life is death. According to their acts they go <span class='add'>[Reaping]</span> merit’s and evil’s fruits: Evil-doers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell”: this is corruption. This is how the roundabout is made to occur.</p>
<p>556.“All creatures will <span class='add'>[most surely]</span> die … Evil-doers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell”: there are these three rounds: the round of suffering, the round of action, and the round of defilement. “Others maintain the path in being And find extinction free from taints” is the stopping (non-occurrence) of the three rounds.</p>
<p>557.“All creatures will <span class='add'>[most surely]</span> die … Evil-doers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell” is the disappointment. “The merit-makers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to heaven” is the gratification. “Others maintain the path in being And find extinction free from taints” is the escape.</p>
<p>558.“All creatures will <span class='add'>[most surely]</span> die … Evil-doers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell” is cause and fruit. The five categories are the fruit and the craving the cause. “Others maintain the path in being And find extinction free from taints” is the path and its fruit.</p>
<p>559.“All creatures will <span class='add'>[most surely]</span> die … Evil-doers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell” is corruption. That corruption is of three kinds: corruption by craving, corruption by views, and corruption by misconduct. Herein, corruption by craving can be demonstrated by the three kinds of craving, namely craving for sensual desires, craving for being, and craving for non-being, <span class='add'>[that is,]</span> by the three kinds of misconduct, namely bodily misconduct and verbal misconduct <span class='add'>[as the former]</span>, and mental misconduct <span class='add'>[as the latter]</span>. Its detail is the ten unprofitable courses of action. “Others maintain the path in being And find extinction free from taints” is cleansing. Now this cleansing is <span class='add'>[also]</span> of three kinds, that is to say: corruption by craving is purified by quiet, and that quiet is the concentration category; corruption by views is purified by insight, and that insight is the understanding category; and corruption by misconduct is purified by good conduct, and that good conduct is the virtue category.</p>
<p>560.“All creatures will <span class='add'>[most surely]</span> die Because the end of life is death. According to their acts they go <span class='add'>[Reaping]</span> merit’s and evil’s fruits: Evil-doers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to hell” is the way of demerit. “The merit-makers <span class='add'>[pass on]</span> to heaven” is the way of merit. “Others maintain the path in being And find extinction free from taints” is the way that surmounts merit and demerit.</p>
<p>561. Herein, as to the “way of merit” and the “way of demerit”, these are one way that leads anywhere, one among the states of unease and another among the gods. And as to the “way that surmounts merit and demerit”, this way leads either here or there.</p>
<p>562. Now there are three classes, namely the class of those certain-of-wrongness, the class of those certain-of-rightness, and the class of those not-thus-certain. While the certainty-of-wrongness class and the certainty-of-rightness class herein are one way, namely that which leads either here or there, it is the class of those without this certainty herein that is the way that leads anywhere. For what reason? If someone <span class='add'>[in this class]</span> got the <span class='add'>[requisite]</span> condition, he would reappear in hell, if he got the <span class='add'>[requisite]</span> condition, he would reappear among animals, if he got the <span class='add'>[requisite]</span> condition, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli97' href='#pts-vp-pli97'>PTS vp Pli 97</a> he would reappear in the ghost realm, if he got the <span class='add'>[requisite]</span> condition, he would reappear among the Asura Demons, if he got the <span class='add'>[requisite]</span> condition, he would reappear among the gods, if he got the <span class='add'>[requisite]</span> condition, he would reappear among human beings, if he got the <span class='add'>[requisite]</span> condition, he would attain extinction. That is why this is the way that leads anywhere.</p>
<p>563. Knowledge as to cause and as to instance about this unlimitedly is called the Perfect One’s second Power consisting in Knowledge of the Way that Leads anywhere.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>iii. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en133' href='#pts-vp-en133'>PTS vp En 133</a> Knowledge of the World with its Many and Different Elements</i>]</span></p>
<p>564. The way that leads anywhere is the world of many elements; the way that leads either here or there is the world of different elements.</p>
<p>565. Herein, what is the world of many elements? It is the eye element, form element, eye-consciousness element, ear element, sound element, ear-consciousness element, nose element, odour element, nose-consciousness element, tongue element, flavour element, tongue-consciousness element, body element, tangible element, body-consciousness element, mind element, idea element, mind-consciousness element; the earth element, water element, fire element, air element, space element, consciousness element; the sensual-desire element, ill-will element, cruelty element, renunciation element, non-ill-will element, non-cruelty element; the pain element, grief element, ignorance element, pleasure element, joy element, onlooking-equanimity element; the form element, formless element, cessation element; the determinations element, the extinction element. This is the world of many elements.</p>
<p>566. Herein, what is the world of different elements? The eye element is one, the form element is another, the eye-consciousness element is another, … and so with all the rest down to … the extinction element is another.</p>

<p>568. Many elements and different elements of what world? Whatever element creatures believe in, that they express and insist upon. Some believe in forms, some believe in sounds, some believe in odours, some believe in flavours, some believe in tangibles, some believe in ideas, some believe in females, some believe in males, some believe in generosity, some believe in inferiority, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli98' href='#pts-vp-pli98'>PTS vp Pli 98</a> some believe in superiority, some believe in gods, some believe in human beings, some believe in extinction.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en134' href='#pts-vp-en134'>PTS vp En 134</a>569. Knowledge as to cause and as to instance about this unlimitedly thus “This one is outguidable, this one is not outguidable, this one is going to heaven, this one is going to a bad destination” is called the Perfect One’s fourth Power consisting in knowledge of how creatures differ in their beliefs.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>v. Knowledge of Ripening of Action</i>]</span></p>
<p>570. As these <span class='add'>[creatures]</span> believe so they come to be. <span class='add'>[For]</span> they undertake this or that kind of undertaking of action. They undertake action in six ways: some through greed, some through hate, some through delusion, some through faith, some through energy, and some through understanding.</p>
<p>571. That <span class='add'>[action can be]</span> divided into two as that which goes with the roundabout and that which goes to extinction.</p>
<p>572. Herein, any action which <span class='add'>[someone]</span> does through greed and through hate and through delusion is black action with black ripening. Herein, any action which he does through faith and through energy is white action with white ripening. Herein, any action which he does through greed and through hate and through delusion and through faith is black-and-white action with black-and-white ripening. Herein, any action which he does through energy and through understanding is action that is not black and not white with neither-black-nor-white ripening. That is the supreme action, the best action, and it conduces to the exhaustion of action.</p>
<p>573. There are four ways of undertaking action: there is a way of undertaking action that has presently-arisen pleasure and ripens in the future as pain. There is a way of undertaking action that has presently-arisen pain and ripens in the future as pleasure. There is a way of undertaking action that has presently-arisen pain and ripens in the future as pain. There is a way of undertaking action that has presently-arisen pleasure and ripens in the future as pleasure: any such kind of undertaking action.</p>
<p>574. The Blessed One, <span class='add'>[when he sees that]</span> “An undertaking of <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en135' href='#pts-vp-en135'>PTS vp En 135</a> unprofitable action has been stored up by this person, which <span class='add'>[though as yet]</span> unripened is just about to ripen, and <span class='add'>[so]</span> he is incapable of coming to the breaking out”, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli99' href='#pts-vp-pli99'>PTS vp Pli 99</a> does not advise him, as in the case of Devadatta, Sunakkhatta, son of Licchavis, and any other creatures certain of wrongness.</p>
<p>575. The Blessed One, <span class='add'>[when he sees that]</span> “These persons have stored up <span class='add'>[some]</span> unprofitable action, but <span class='add'>[the undertaking of it]</span> has not yet come to its fulfilment; it is <span class='add'>[still]</span> before it has come to fulfilment, before it has given fruit, before it has obstructed the path, before it has exceeded <span class='add'>[the bounds of]</span> outguidability”, advises them while <span class='add'>[their action is]</span> not <span class='add'>[fully]</span> undertaken, as in the cases of Puṇṇa the ox-duty ascetic and the naked dog-duty ascetic.</p>
<p>576. The Blessed One, <span class='add'>[when he sees that]</span> “This person’s undertaking of unprofitable action when fulfilled will obstruct the path, <span class='add'>[but]</span> it is <span class='add'>[still]</span> before it has come to fulfilment, before it has given fruit, before it has obstructed the path, before it has exceeded <span class='add'>[the bounds of]</span> outguidability”, advises him while <span class='add'>[his action is]</span> not <span class='add'>[fully]</span> undertaken, as in the case of the venerable Angulimāla.</p>
<p>577. In all cases there is the light, the medium, and the outstanding state. Herein, imperturbable determinative acts are light, the remaining profitable determinations are medium, and unprofitable determinations are outstanding.</p>
<p>578. Knowledge as to cause and as to instance unlimitedly thus “This <span class='add'>[kind of action]</span> is to be felt <span class='add'>[ripening]</span> here and now (in this life), this kind is to be felt on reappearance, this kind is to be felt in some subsequent period; this is to be felt in hell, this is to be felt as an animal, this is to be felt in the ghost realm, this is to be felt as an Asura demon, this is to be felt as a god, this is to be felt as a human being” is called the Perfect One’s fifth Power consisting in knowledge as to cause and as to instance unlimitedly of past, future, and presently arisen, undertaking of action, which is Knowledge of Diversity in Ripening.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>vi.</i> <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en136' href='#pts-vp-en136'>PTS vp En 136</a><i>Knowledge of Defilement, Cleansing, and Emergence, in the cases of the Meditations, Liberations, Concentrations, and Attainments</i>]</span></p>
<p>579. There is unobstructed knowledge of actions thus undertaken, and of meditations, liberations, concentrations, and attainments thus undertaken, <span class='add'>[knowing]</span> that “This is the corruption, this is the cleansing, this is the emergence, this is how it is corrupted, this is how it is cleansed, this is how there is emergence”.</p>
<p>580. Herein, how many meditations? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli100' href='#pts-vp-pli100'>PTS vp Pli 100</a> Four meditations.</p>
<p>How many liberations? Eleven and eight and seven and three and two.</p>
<p>How many concentrations? Three concentrations: concentration with thinking and exploring; concentration without thinking and with only exploring; concentration without thinking and without exploring.</p>
<p>How many attainments? Five attainments: percipient attainment, unpercipient attainment, neither-percipient-nor-unpercipient attainment, attainment percipient of non-entity, attainment of cessation.</p>
<p>581. Herein, what is the corruption? Lust for sensual desires and ill-will are the corruption of the first meditation, and the first two <span class='add'>[meditations are so for]</span> a shy meditator, or any concentration dealing with an inferior state. These are the corruptions.</p>
<p>582. Herein, what is the cleansing? The purification of the first meditation from the hindrances, and the <span class='add'>[attainment of the]</span> last <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en137' href='#pts-vp-en137'>PTS vp En 137</a> two <span class='add'>[meditations for]</span> a shy meditator, or any concentration dealing with distinction, these are cleansing.</p>
<p>583. Herein, what is the emergence? Skill in emerging from an attainment.</p>
<p>584. Knowledge as to cause and as to instance about this unlimitedly is called the Perfect One’s sixth Power consisting in knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence, in the cases of all meditations, liberations, concentrations, and attainments.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>vii. Knowledge of the Disposition of Creatures’ Faculties</i>]</span></p>
<p>585. That same concentration has three ideas for its equipment, namely faculties, powers, and energy. Those same faculties come to be powers in virtue of energy: they are faculties in the sense of predominance, while they are powers in the sense of unshakability.</p>
<p>586. They have the blunt, medium, and outstanding states thus: This one has blunt faculties, this one has medium faculties, this one has outstanding faculties.</p>
<p>587. Herein, the Blessed One advises one of keen faculties with advice in brief; the Blessed One advises one of medium faculties with advice in brief and detail; the Blessed One advises one of blunt faculties with advice in detail.</p>
<p>Herein, the Blessed One discloses a blunt (light) teaching of the True Idea to one of keen faculties; the Blessed One discloses a blunt-to-keen teaching of the True Idea <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli101' href='#pts-vp-pli101'>PTS vp Pli 101</a> to one of medium faculties; the Blessed One discloses a keen teaching of the True Idea to one of blunt faculties.</p>
<p>Herein, the Blessed One discloses quiet to one of keen faculties; the Blessed One discloses quiet and insight to one of medium faculties; the Blessed One discloses insight to one of blunt faculties.</p>
<p>Herein, the Blessed One discloses escape to one of keen faculties; the Blessed One discloses disappointment and escape to one of medium faculties; the Blessed One discloses gratification and disappointment and escape to one of blunt faculties.</p>
<p>Herein, the Blessed One makes one of keen faculties understand by means of the training in the higher understanding; the Blessed One makes one of medium faculties understand by means of the training in the higher cognizance; the Blessed One makes one of blunt faculties understand by means of the training in the higher virtue.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en138' href='#pts-vp-en138'>PTS vp En 138</a>588. Knowledge as to cause and as to instance about this unlimitedly thus “This one has gone to this plane and keeping-in-being, and at this period, and with this kind of instruction; and this one has such and such elements <span class='add'>[beginning with the inferior]</span>, and such was the bias <span class='add'>[in his view]</span>, and such was his underlying tendency” is called the Perfect One’s seventh Power consisting in knowledge of diversity in the several faculties of other creatures, other persons.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>viii. Knowledge of Past Life</i>]</span></p>
<p>589. Herein, he recollects his manifold past life, that is to say, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many hundred births, many thousand births, many hundred thousand births, many aeons of <span class='add'>[world]</span> contraction, many aeons of <span class='add'>[world]</span> expansion, many aeons of <span class='add'>[world]</span> contraction and expansion: “There I was so named, of such a race, with such appearance, such was my nutriment, such my feeling of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a race, with such appearance, such was my nutriment, such my feeling of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli102' href='#pts-vp-pli102'>PTS vp Pli 102</a> and passing away from there, I reappeared here”, thus with its moods and its phases he recollects his manifold past life.</p>
<p>590. Herein, among creatures passing on to heaven and creatures passing on to humanity, and creatures passing on to states of unease, the Blessed One knows without reserve, recollecting such and such existences thus “This person has greed, etc., prominent and non-greed, etc., weak; this person has non-greed, etc., prominent and greed, etc., weak; or whichever are prominent and whichever weak; This person has these faculties stored up, this person has these faculties not stored up, in that million aeons, hundred thousand aeons, thousand aeons, hundred aeons, aeon, aeon-interval, half-aeon, year, half-year, month, half-moon, day, or hour, by means of this negligence, or by means of this confidence”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>ix. The Heavenly Eye</i>]</span></p>
<p>591. Herein, with the Heavenly Eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees creatures deceasing and reappearing, inferior and superior, comely and uncomely, well behaved and ill-behaved, he <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en139' href='#pts-vp-en139'>PTS vp En 139</a> understands how creatures pass on according to their actions thus “These unworthy creatures, misconducted in body, speech and mind, revilers of Noble Ones, wrong in their views, undertaking actions due to wrong view, have, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappeared in a state of unease, in a bad destination, in perdition, in hell; but these worthy creatures, well conducted in body, speech and mind, not revilers of Noble Ones, right in their views, undertaking actions due to right view, have, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappeared in a good destination, in the heavenly world”.</p>
<p>592. Herein, among creatures passing on to heaven and creatures passing on to humanity and creatures passing on to states of unease, <span class='add'>[the Blessed One knows without reserve]</span> “By this person such action was stored up in that million aeons, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli103' href='#pts-vp-pli103'>PTS vp Pli 103</a> … day, or hour, by means of this negligence, or by means of this confidence”.</p>
<p>593. These two kinds of knowledge of the Blessed One’s, the Knowledge of Recollection of Past Life and the Heavenly Eye, are the Perfect One’s eighth and ninth Powers.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>x. Omniscience in Knowledge of Exhaustion of Taints</i>]</span></p>
<p>594. Herein, when omniscience was reached, when all ideas were found, when the spotless immaculate omniscient knowledge had arisen, when Māra was routed at the foot of the Tree of Enlightenment: that constitutes the Perfect One’s tenth Power consisting in the Knowledge of Complete Extinction of all Taints. For the Enlightened Ones, the Blessed Ones, are possessed of ten powers.</p>
