<h2>The 16 Modes of Conveying</h2>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Gratification, Disappointment,<br>
Escape, Fruit, Means, the Blessed One’s<br>
Injunction to devotees, this Mode<br>
Is the Conveying of a Teaching.</p>
<p>6. What in the Thread is asked and answered,<br>
As well as a verse-paraphrase,<br>
And the Thread’s <span class='add'>[term-]</span> investigation<br>
This Mode Conveys Investigation.</p>
<p>7. Looking for right and wrong construing<br>
In the case of all the Conveyings’<br>
Plane and resort <span class='add'>[will]</span> demonstrate<br>
The Mode Conveying a Construing.</p>
<p>8. The Victor teaching an idea<br>
Teaches what that idea has too<br>
As footing; so with each idea:<br>
This is the Mode Conveying Footings.</p>
<p>9. When one idea is mentioned, all<br>
Ideas of like characteristic<br>
Are mentioned too: this constitutes<br>
The Mode Conveying Characteristics.</p>
<p>10. By <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en9' href='#pts-vp-en9'>PTS vp En 9</a> way of phrasing, (i) the Linguistic,<br>
(ii) The Purport, and (iii) the teaching’s Source,<br>
And (iv) the Consecutive-Sequence:<br>
This Mode Conveys a Fourfold Array.</p>
<p>11. The Mode that, when there is one Footing,<br>
Searches for a footing that remains<br>
And then Converts the opposites<br>
Is that Conveying a Conversion.</p>
<p>12. It analyses idea, footing,<br> 
Plane <span class='add'>[of types of men]</span>, the shared<br>
And unshared: this Mode should be known<br>
As that Conveying Analysis.</p>
<p>13. That into opposites reversing<br>
Ideas of profit and unprofit<br>
Shown to be kept in being and left<br>
Is called the Mode Conveying Reversal.</p>
<p>14. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli4' href='#pts-vp-pli4'>PTS vp Pli 4</a> Knower of Threads is he that knows<br>
How many synonyms for one<br>
Idea are in the Thread: this Mode<br>
Is that Conveying Synonyms.</p>
<p>15. The Blessed One one idea teaches<br>
By means of manifold descriptions;<br>
This mood can thus be known to be<br>
The Mode that does Convey Descriptions.</p>
<p>16. Dependent-Rising, Faculties,<br>
Categories, Elements, Bases:<br>
The Mode that by these means gives entry<br>
Is that Conveying Ways of Entry.</p>
<p>17. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en10' href='#pts-vp-en10'>PTS vp En 10</a>Seeking if in a question answered<br>
What in the verse did instigate<br>
Its asking is cleared up or not:<br>
This Mode Conveys a Clearing Up.</p>
<p>18. Ideas when demonstrated by<br>
<p><span class='add'>[Both]</span> unity and diversity,<br>
Need thereby suffer no disjunction<br>
This Mode Conveys Expression’s Terms.</p>
<p>19. Ideas that generate each an idea<br>
In due relation are conditions;<br>
And by its picking out the cause<br>
This Mode Conveys the Requisite.</p>
<p>20. Ideas with those whose roots they are,<br>
And those shown by the Sage to have<br>
One meaning, should be co-ordinated:<br>
This Mode conveys Co-ordination.</p>

<h2>The 5 Guide-Lines</h2>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>21. The Guide-Line Craving and Ignorance guiding<br>
By Quiet and Insight, and construing<br>
Appropriately the four Truths<br>
Is the Conversion of Relishing.</p>
<p>22. Guiding <span class='add'>[ideas of]</span> profit and<br>
Unprofit by their <span class='add'>[triple]</span> roots<br>
As they are, really, not unreally,<br>
That Guide-Line they call the Trefoil.</p>
<p>23. The <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en11' href='#pts-vp-en11'>PTS vp En 11</a> wise in Guide-Lines have called that<br>
Lions’ Play which by the faculties<br>
Does faith’s true objects guide, and also<br>
By the perversions the defilements.</p>
<p>24. What mentally plots out <span class='add'>[ideas<br>
of]</span> profit and unprofit stated<br>
Or here or there in expositions<br>
They call the Plotting of Directions.</p>
<p>25. After <span class='add'>[thus]</span> plotting with the Plotting<br>
Of Directions, what then throws up<br>
All profit <span class='add'>[ideas]</span> and unprofit<br>
And guides them in is called the Hook.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How the Modes of Conveying and the Guide-Lines are Employed</h2>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>26. Sixteen Conveyings first, surveying<br>
With Plotting then of the Directions,<br>
And having collected with the Hook,<br>
Three Guide-Lines demonstrate a Thread.</p>
<p>27. (i) The Letter, (ii) the Term, an then (iii) the Phrasing,<br>
Also (iv) the Linguistic <span class='add'>[inflexion]</span>,<br>
(v) the Demonstration, and (vi) the Mood<br>
As sixth: this much concerns the phrasing.</p>
<p>28. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli5' href='#pts-vp-pli5'>PTS vp Pli 5</a> (vii) Explaining, (viii) Displaying, and (ix) Divulging,<br>
(x) Analysing, (xi) Exhibiting, (xii) Describing:<br>
By these six terms are demonstrated<br>
A meaning and an action too.</p>
<p>29. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en12' href='#pts-vp-en12'>PTS vp En 12</a>The Blessed One’s Utterance’s meaning<br>
Yokes nine terms for its meaning, namely:<br>
The <span class='add'>[first]</span> three Guide-Lines, dropping none,<br>
And meaning-words that number six.</p>
<p>30. For meaning nine terms, twenty-four<br>
For searching of the phrasing, too,<br>
These come in all to thirty-three,<br>
And that much constitutes the guide.</p>
