<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>So let his cognizance be guarded …</p>

<p>623.“So let his cognizance be guarded, Having for pasture right intention, Giving right view first place”: when right view is admitted the five faculties are admitted <span class='add'>[right view being synonymous with the understanding faculty]</span>. This is the way of entry by Faculties.</p>
<p>624. Those same faculties are science. With the arising of science, cessation of ignorance (nescience); with cessation of ignorance, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en145' href='#pts-vp-en145'>PTS vp En 145</a> cessation of determinations; … and so the whole Dependent Arising … This is the way of entry by Dependent Arising.</p>
<p>625. Those same faculties are comprised by the Categories, by the virtue category, by the concentration category, and by the understanding category. This is the way of entry by Categories.</p>
<p>626. Those same categories are included in determinations. These determinations—<span class='add'>[in this case]</span> free from taints and not factors of being—are comprised within the idea element. This is the way of entry by Elements.</p>
<p>627. That idea element is included in the idea base, which base is <span class='add'>[in this case]</span> free from taints and not a factor of being. This is the way of entry by Bases.</p>
<p class='end'>The Mode of Conveying Ways of Entry in Combined Treatment is ended.</p>
