<p>303. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli57' href='#pts-vp-pli57'>PTS vp Pli 57</a> Any teaching by <span class='add'>[explanatory]</span> talk about the nature <span class='add'>[of anything]</span> is a description <span class='add'>[in terms of]</span> presentation. And what is the teaching as <span class='add'>[explanatory]</span> talk about the nature <span class='add'>[of anything]</span>? It is the four Truths, according as the Blessed One said: (<i>This is suffering</i>). This is a description. It is a description <span class='add'>[in terms of]</span> presentation <span class='add'>[applied]</span> to the five categories, the six elements, the eighteen elements, the twelve bases, and the ten faculties.</p>

Wherever consciousness finds a steadying-point and develops, there is the finding of a footing for name-and-form. Wherever there is the finding of a footing for name-and-form, there is maturing of determinations. Wherever there is maturing of determinations, there renewed being is made to occur in the future. Wherever renewed being is made to occur in the future, there is future birth, ageing and death. Wherever there is future birth, ageing and death, that is accompanied by sorrow, bhihkhus, accompanied by trouble, accompanied by despair, I say. If there is lust … for contact, … despair.

<p>311. This is a description in terms of cessation applied to cessation, a description in terms of dispassion applied to gratification, a <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en87' href='#pts-vp-en87'>PTS vp En 87</a> description in terms of diagnosis applied to suffering, a description in terms of abandoning applied to origin, a description in terms of keeping in being applied to the path, a description in terms of verification applied to cessation.</p>

<p>313. This is a description in terms of penetration applied to the truths, a description in terms of presentation applied to the plane of seeing, a description in terms of keeping in being applied to the path, a description in terms of verification applied to the fruit of Stream-Entry.</p>

<p>315. This is a description in terms of arising applied to knowledge of exhaustion, a description in terms of opportunity applied to knowledge of non-arising, a description in terms of keeping in being applied to the path, a description in terms of diagnosis applied to suffering, a description in terms of abandoning applied to origin, a description in terms of instigation applied to the energy faculty, a description in terms of “removal” applied to “grubs”, a description in terms of presentation applied to the plane of keeping in being, a description in terms of counteraction applied to evil unprofitable ideas.</p>

<p>323. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli61' href='#pts-vp-pli61'>PTS vp Pli 61</a> “Measured” is the determinations-element. “Unmeasured” is the extinction-element.</p>
<p>“That gives existence measured and unmeasured” is a description <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en89' href='#pts-vp-en89'>PTS vp En 89</a> in terms of acquaintanceship applied to all ideas, a description in terms of presentation applied to the Discrimination-of-Ideas.</p>
<p>324.“The Stilled One dropped the being-determinant” is a description in terms of giving-up applied to origin, a description in terms of diagnosis applied to suffering.</p>
<p>325.“And happy in himself and concentrated” is a description in terms of keeping-in-being applied to Mindfulness-Occupied-with-the-Body, a description in terms of steadiness applied to unification of cognizance.</p>
<p>326.“He sundered, like a mail-coat, self-existence” is a description in terms of “breaking out” applied to cognizance, a description in terms of assuming applied to omniscience, a description in terms of “bursting open” applied to the “egg-shell of ignorance”.</p>

<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en90' href='#pts-vp-en90'>PTS vp En 90</a>328.“Who pain” is a description in terms of a synonym applied to pain (suffering) and it is a description in terms of diagnosis applied to it.</p>
<p>329.“And that wherefrom it sources” is a description in terms of giving-being applied to origin and it is a description in terms of abandoning applied to it.</p>
<p>330.“Has seen” is a description in terms of a synonym applied to the eye of knowledge and it is a description in terms of penetration applied to it.</p>
<p>331.“How could a man to sensual desires stoop” is a description in terms of sensual desires applied to craving for sensual desires and it is a description in terms of insistence applied to it.</p>
<p>332.“Who knows they make for clinging in the world” is a description in terms of “seeing an enemy” applied to sensual desires; for sensual desires have the simile of a pit of coals, the simile of a lump of flesh, are like a conflagration, and have the similes of a chasm and a serpent’s head.</p>
<p>333.“Mindful … them” is a description in terms of dispersal applied to abandoning, a description in terms of presentation applied to Mindfulness-Occupied-with-the-Body, and a description in terms of keeping-in-being applied to the path.</p>
<p>334.“Should train in guiding … away” is a description in terms of penetration applied to outguiding of lust, outguiding of hate, and outguiding of delusion.</p>
<p>335.“A man” is a description in terms of a synonym applied to a devotee.</p>
<p>336. Now when a devotee understands that “they make for clinging” then without the arising of sensual desires he arouses profitable ideas, he makes efforts for the arising of unarisen profitable ideas. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli62' href='#pts-vp-pli62'>PTS vp Pli 62</a> This is a description in terms of effort applied to the reaching of the as yet unreached, a description in terms of presentation applied to discontent with what deals with the hither-side.</p>
<p>337. Herein, (<i>He makes efforts for the steadiness of arisen profitable ideas</i>): this is a description in terms of diligence applied to keeping in being, a description in terms of presentation applied to the energy faculty, a description in terms of preservation applied to profitable ideas, a description in terms of steadiness applied to the training in the higher cognizance.</p>
<p>That is why the Blessed One said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“How <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en91' href='#pts-vp-en91'>PTS vp En 91</a> could a man to sensual desires stoop<br>
