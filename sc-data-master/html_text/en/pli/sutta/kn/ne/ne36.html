<h1>5. Chapter iii The Moulding of the Guide-Lines</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en148' href='#pts-vp-en148'>PTS vp En 148</a>644. Herein, what is the Moulding of the Guide-Lines? <span class='add'>[It is as follows.]</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>Introductory</i>]</span></p>
<p>No past term is evident of ignorance and of craving for being. Herein, ignorance is the hindrance and craving the fetter.</p>
<p>645. Creatures with ignorance for their hindrance and fettered <span class='add'>[by craving]</span> to ignorance, explore on the side of ignorance. They are called “of view-temperament”. Creatures with craving as their fetter and fettered to craving, explore on the side of craving. They are called “of craving-temperament”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>The Conversion of Relishing</i>]</span></p>
<p>646. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli110' href='#pts-vp-pli110'>PTS vp Pli 110</a> Those of view-temperament who have gone forth <span class='add'>[into homelessness]</span> outside this <span class='add'>[dispensation]</span> abide devoted to the pursuit of self-torment. Those of craving-temperament who have gone forth <span class='add'>[into homelessness]</span> outside this <span class='add'>[dispensation]</span> abide devoted to the pursuit of indulging sensual pleasure among sensual desires.</p>
<p>647. Herein what is the reason why those of view-temperament who have gone forth outside this <span class='add'>[dispensation]</span> abide devoted to the pursuit of self-torment, why those of craving-temperament who have gone forth outside this <span class='add'>[dispensation]</span> abide devoted to the pursuit of indulging sensual pleasure among sensual desires? Outside this <span class='add'>[dispensation]</span> there is no definition of truth, so whence any explanation of the four truths, or any skill in quiet and insight, or any reaching the pleasure of peace?</p>
<p>648. With cognizance distorted through having no acquaintanceship with the pleasure of peace, they have made such pronouncements as (<i>There is no pleasure</i> <span class='add'>[<i>arrived at</i>]</span> <i>through pleasure: pleasure is to</i> <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en149' href='#pts-vp-en149'>PTS vp En 149</a> <i>be arrived at through pain</i> (<i>suffering</i>) ), and (<i>He who cultivates sensual desires enriches the world; he who enriches the world lays by much merit</i>). So perceiving, and with such views, aspiring to pleasure through pain, <span class='add'>[or]</span> perceiving merit in sensual desires, they abide devoted to the pursuit of self-torment and devoted to the pursuit of indulging sensual pleasure. Such being their acquaintanceship, they enrich only the sickness, they enrich only the boil, they enrich only the barb. Overwhelmed by the sickness, oppressed by the boil, wounded by the barb, doing their diving in and out of the hells, the animal womb, ghosts and demons, making their existence co-essential with exhilaration and depression, they find no medicine for the sickness, the boil, the barb.</p>
<p>649. (i) Herein, the pursuit of self-torment and the pursuit of indulgence of sensual pleasures are the corruption; quiet and insight are the cleansing. The pursuit of self-torment and the pursuit of indulgence of sensual pleasure are the sickness; quiet and insight are the counteractive medicine for the sickness. The pursuit of self-torment and the pursuit of indulgence of sensual pleasure are the boil; quiet and insight are the counteractive medicine for the boil. The pursuit of self-torment and the pursuit of indulgence of sensual pleasure are the barb; quiet and insight are the medicine that extracts the barb.</p>
<p>650. Herein, the corruption is Suffering; craving, as the clinging thereto, is the Origin; cessation of craving is Cessation of Suffering; quiet and insight are the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering.</p>
<p>651. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli111' href='#pts-vp-pli111'>PTS vp Pli 111</a> These are the four Truths. Suffering has to be diagnosed, the Origin abandoned, the Path kept in being, and Cessation verified.</p>
<p>652. (iii) <span class='add'>[Again]</span> herein, one of view-temperament approaches form as self, approaches feeling … perception … determinations … consciousness as self. One of craving-temperament approaches self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form; or he <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en150' href='#pts-vp-en150'>PTS vp En 150</a> approaches self as possessing feeling … possessing perception … possessing determinations … possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. This is what is called the twenty-based embodiment view.</p>
<p>653. Opposed to this is right view disjoined from worlds, and its attendant right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is the noble eight-factored path.</p>
<p>654. That is the three categories: the virtue category, the concentration category, and the understanding category. The virtue category and the concentration category are quiet, and the understanding category is insight.</p>
<p>655. Herein, embodiment is Suffering, the origin of embodiment is the Origin of Suffering, the cessation of embodiment is Cessation of Suffering, and the noble eight-factored path is the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering.</p>
<p>656. These are the four Truths. Suffering has to be diagnosed, the Origin abandoned, the Path kept in being, and Cessation verified.</p>
<p>657. (iii) Herein, those who approach form as self, who approach feeling … perception … determinations … consciousness as self, are called annihilationists. Those who approach self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form, who approach self as possessing feeling … possessing perception … possessing determinations … possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness, are called eternalists.</p>
<p>658. Herein, annihilationism and eternalism are the two extremes. They <span class='add'>[both cause]</span> the occurrence of the roundabout.</p>
<p>659. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli112' href='#pts-vp-pli112'>PTS vp Pli 112</a> The opposite of that is the middle way, the noble eight-factored path. This is the non-occurrence of the roundabout.</p>
<p>660. Herein, occurrence is Suffering; craving, as the clinging thereto, is the Origin; cessation of craving is Cessation of Suffering; the noble eight-factored path is the Way Leading to Cessation of Suffering.</p>
<p>661. These are the four Truths. Suffering has to be diagnosed, the Origin abandoned, the Path kept in being, and Cessation verified.</p>
<p>662. (iv) Herein, in combination annihilationism and eternalism are the twenty-based embodiment view, while in detail they are the sixty-two types of views.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en151' href='#pts-vp-en151'>PTS vp En 151</a>663. The opposites of these are the forty-three ideas that side with enlightenment, the eight liberations, the ten bases for wholeness.</p>
<p>664. The sixty-two types of views are delusion’s net, which has no beginning and continues its occurrence unremittingly. The forty-three ideas that partake of enlightenment are the diamond of knowledge that bursts open delusion’s net.</p>
<p>665. Herein, the delusion is ignorance, and the net is craving for being.</p>
<p>That is why it was said above “No past term is evident of ignorance and of craving for being”.</p>
<p>666. Herein, when one of view-temperament has gone forth <span class='add'>[into homelessness]</span> in this dispensation he becomes one who lives with continuous effacement, having keen regard for effacement, while when one of craving-temperament has gone forth in this dispensation he is one who lives with the training preserved, having keen regard for the training.</p>
<p>667. When one of view-temperament finds a footing in the certainty of rightness, he is a Follower by Ideas, while when one of craving-temperament finds a footing in the certainty of rightness, he is a Follower by Faith.</p>
<p>668. One of view-temperament finds the outlet on the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship and with swift acquaintanceship, and one of craving-temperament finds the outlet on the painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship and with swift acquaintanceship.</p>
<p>669. Herein, what is the reason why one of craving-temperament finds outlet on the painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship and with swift acquaintanceship? Because sensual desires have not been given up by him. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli113' href='#pts-vp-pli113'>PTS vp Pli 113</a> When <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en152' href='#pts-vp-en152'>PTS vp En 152</a> he is secluding himself from sensual desires, he relinquishes painfully and sluggishly gains knowledge of the True Idea. Now as to one of view-temperament, from the very beginning he is no seeker of sensual desires. <span class='add'>[So]</span> when he is secluding himself from them he relinquishes swiftly and he swiftly gains knowledge of the True Idea.</p>
<p>670. The painful way is of two kinds: with sluggish acquaintanceship and with swift acquaintanceship. And the pleasant way is of two kinds: with sluggish acquaintanceship and with swift acquaintanceship. And creatures are of two kinds: with blunt faculties and with keen faculties. Those with blunt faculties relinquish sluggishly and sluggishly gain knowledge of the True Idea. Those with keen faculties relinquish swiftly and swiftly gain knowledge of the True Idea.</p>
<p>671. These are the four ways. It is by these same four ways that anyone at all ever has found the outlet, or finds the outlet, or will find the outlet.</p>
<p>672. That is how Noble Ones describe a tetrad path for unwise folk to cultivate, for fools to desire, for the lustful to master their lust by, the aim of which is conversion of relishing, of craving for being.</p>
<p>This is called the Plane of Conversion of Relishing. That is why it was said</p>

</ol>
<p>675. 1–2. In the first nutriment there is the first perversion; in the second nutriment, the second perversion; in the third nutriment, the third perversion; in the fourth nutriment, the fourth perversion.</p>
<p>2–3. In the first perversion there is the first assumption; in the second perversion, the second assumption; in the third perversion, the third assumption; in the fourth perversion, the fourth assumption.</p>
<p>3–4. In the first assumption there is the first bond; in the second assumption, the second bond; in the third assumption, the third bond; in the fourth assumption, the fourth bond.</p>
<p>4–5. In the first bond there is the first tie; in the second bond, the second tie; in the third bond, the third tie; in the fourth bond, the fourth tie.</p>
<p>5–6. In the first tie there is the first taint; in the second tie, the second taint; in the third tie, the third taint; in the fourth tie, the fourth taint.</p>
<p>6–7. In the first taint there is the first flood; in the second taint, the second flood; in the third taint, the third flood; in the fourth taint, the fourth flood.</p>
<p>7–8. In the first flood there is the first barb; in the second flood, the second barb; in the third flood, the third barb; in the fourth flood, the fourth barb.</p>
<p>8–9. In the first barb there is the first steadying-point for consciousness; in the second barb, the second steadying-point for consciousness; in the third barb, the third steadying-point for consciousness; in the fourth barb, the fourth steadying-point for consciousness.</p>
<p>9–10. In the first steadying-point for consciousness there is the first going on a bad way; in the second steadying-point for consciousness, the second going on a bad way; in the third steadying-point for consciousness, the third going on a bad way; in the fourth steadying-point for consciousness, the fourth going on a bad way.</p>
<p>676. 1. Herein, physical nutriment and nutriment as contact are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while nutriment <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en155' href='#pts-vp-en155'>PTS vp En 155</a> as mind-choice and nutriment as consciousness are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>677. 2. Herein, the perversion that there is beauty in the ugly and the perversion that there is pleasure in the painful are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while the perversion that there is permanence in the impermanent and the perversion that there is self in the not-self are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>678. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli115' href='#pts-vp-pli115'>PTS vp Pli 115</a>3. Herein, sensual-desire-assumption and being-assumption are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while view-assumption and self-doctrine-assumption are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>679. 4. Herein, the bond of sensual desire and the bond of being are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while the bond of views and the bond of ignorance are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>680. 5. The body-tie of covetousness and the body-tie of ill-will are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while the body-tie of misapprehension-of-virtue-and-duty and the body-tie of insistence-that-only-this-is-true are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>681. 6. Herein, the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while the taint of views and the taint of ignorance are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>682. 7. Herein, the flood of sensual desire and the flood of being are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while the flood of views and the flood of ignorance are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>683. 8. Herein, the barb of lust and the barb of hate are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while the barb of conceit and the barb of delusion are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>684. 9. Herein, form as a steadying-point for consciousness passing on and feeling as a steadying-point for consciousness passing on are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while perception as a steadying-point for consciousness passing on and determinations as a steadying-point for consciousness passing on are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>685. 10. Herein, the going on a bad way through will and the going <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en156' href='#pts-vp-en156'>PTS vp En 156</a> on a bad way through hate are imperfections in a person of craving-temperament, while the going on a bad way through fear and the going on a bad way through delusion are imperfections in a person of view-temperament.</p>
<p>686. 1–2. Herein, the perversion that there is beauty in the ugly <span class='add'>[occurs]</span> with respect to physical nutriment; the perversion that there is pleasure in the painful, with respect to nutriment as contact; the perversion that there is permanence in the impermanent, with respect to nutriment as consciousness; the perversion that there is self in the not-self, with respect to nutriment as mind-choice.</p>
<p>687. 2–3. One steady in the first perversion assumes sensual desires: this is called sensual-desire-assuming. One steady in the second perversion <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli116' href='#pts-vp-pli116'>PTS vp Pli 116</a> assumes future being: this is called being-assuming. One steady in the third perversion assumes the view that has expectant relish for the roundabout: this is called view-assuming. One steady in the fourth perversion, having supposed a self, assumes <span class='add'>[accordingly]</span>: this is called self-doctrine-assuming.</p>
<p>688. 3–4. He is fettered (bound) by sensual desires through sensual-desire-assuming: this is called the bond of sensual desire. He is fettered by the kinds of being through being-assuming: this is called the bond of being. He is fettered by an evil view through view-assuming: this is called the bond of views. He is fettered by ignorance through self-doctrine-assuming: this is called the bond of ignorance.</p>
<p>689. 4–5. One steady in the first bond ties the body with covetousness: this is called the body-tie of covetousness. One steady in the second bond ties the body with the tie of ill-will: this is called the body-tie of ill-will. One steady in the third bond ties the body with misapprehension <span class='add'>[of virtue and duty]</span>: this is called the body-tie of misapprehension. One steady in the fourth bond ties the body with the insistence that only this is true: this is called the body-tie of insistence-that-only-this-is-true.</p>
<p>690. 5–6. His defilements, thus tied, taint <span class='add'>[him]</span>. And as what are they said to taint <span class='add'>[him]</span>? As underlying tendency, or as <span class='add'>[open]</span> obsession. Herein, there is the taint of sensual desire <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en157' href='#pts-vp-en157'>PTS vp En 157</a> through the body-tie of covetousness, the taint of being through the body-tie of ill-will, the taint of views through the body-tie of misapprehension <span class='add'>[of virtue and duty]</span>, and the taint of ignorance through the body-tie of insistence-that-only-this-is-true.</p>
<p>691. 6–7. When these four taints abound they are floods, so with the abundance of taints there is abundance of floods. Herein, there is the flood of sensual desires through the taint of sensual desires, the flood of being through the taint of being, the flood of views through the taint of views, the flood of ignorance through the taint of ignorance.</p>
<p>692. 7–8. These four floods, accompanied by the underlying tendencies, intrude into one’s inclinations till they strike one’s heart and remain steady there: hence they are called “barbs”. Herein, there is the barb of lust with the flood of sensual desire, the barb of hate with the flood of being, the barb of conceit with the flood of views, and the barb of delusion with the flood of ignorance.</p>
<p>693. 8–9. When one’s consciousness is gripped by these four barbs it shapes itself to the following four ideas, namely to form, to feeling, to perception, and to determinations.</p>
<p>694. Herein, form <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli117' href='#pts-vp-pli117'>PTS vp Pli 117</a> is the steadying-point for consciousness passing on when consciousness has an infection of relishing through the barb of lust; feeling is the steadying-point for consciousness passing on when consciousness has an infection of relishing through the barb of hate; perception is the steadying-point for consciousness passing on when consciousness has an infection of relishing through the barb of conceit; determinations are the steadying-point for consciousness passing on when consciousness has an infection of relishing through the barb of delusion.</p>
<p>695. 9–10. When one’s consciousness is stiffened by these four steadying-points for consciousness one goes a bad way because of the following four ideas, namely because of will, because of hate, because of fear, and because of delusion.</p>
<p>696. Herein, it is owing to lust that one goes a bad way through will, owing to hate that one goes a bad way through hate, owing to fear that one goes a bad way through fear, and owing to delusion that one goes a bad way through delusion.</p>
<p>That is how that action and those defilements are the cause of the roundabout. That is how all defilements can be demonstrated by the four perversions.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en158' href='#pts-vp-en158'>PTS vp En 158</a>697. Herein, the directions are these four: (i) physical nutriment, the perversion that there is beauty in the ugly, sensual-desire-assumption, the bond of sensual desire, the body-tie of covetousness, the taint of sensual desire, the flood of sensual desire, the barb of lust, form as steadying-point for consciousness passing on, going a bad way through will, are the first direction. (ii) Nutriment as contact, the perversion that there is pleasure in the painful, being-assumption, the bond of being, the body-tie of ill-will, the taint of being, the flood of being, the barb of hate, feeling as steadying-point for consciousness passing on, going a bad way through hate, are the second direction. (iii) Nutriment as consciousness, the perversion that there is permanence in the impermanent, view-assumption, the bond of views, the body-tie of misapprehension, the taint of views, the flood of views, the barb of conceit, perception as steadying-point for consciousness passing on, going a bad way through fear, are the third direction. (iv) Nutriment as mind-choice, the perversion that there is self in the not-self, self-doctrine-assumption, the bond of ignorance, the body-tie of insistence that only this is true, the taint of ignorance, the flood of ignorance, the barb of delusion, determinations as steadying-point for consciousness passing on, going a bad way through delusion, are the fourth direction.</p>
<p>698. (i) Herein, as to the following ten Thread-<span class='add'>[terms]</span>, physical nutriment, the perversion that there is beauty in the ugly, sensual-desire-assumption, the bond of sensual desire, the body-tie of covetousness, the taint of sensual desire, the flood of sensual desire, the barb of lust, form as steadying-point for consciousness passing on, and going a bad way through will: their meaning is one and only the phrasing is different. These are imperfections in a person of lusting temperament.</p>
<p>699. (ii) <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli118' href='#pts-vp-pli118'>PTS vp Pli 118</a> Herein, as to the following ten Thread-<span class='add'>[terms]</span>, nutriment as contact, the perversion that there is pleasure in the painful, being-assumption, the bond of being, the body-tie of ill-will, the taint of being, the flood of being, the barb of hate, feeling as steadying-point for consciousness passing on, and going a bad way through hate: their meaning is one and only the phrasing is different. These are imperfections in a person of hating temperament.</p>
<p>700. (iii) Herein, as to the following ten Thread-<span class='add'>[terms]</span>, nutriment as consciousness, the perversion that there is permanence in the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en159' href='#pts-vp-en159'>PTS vp En 159</a> impermanent, view-assumption, the bond of views, the body-tie of misapprehension, the taint of views, the flood of views, the barb of conceit, perception as steadying-point for consciousness passing on, and going a bad way through fear; their meaning is one, and only the phrasing is different. These are imperfections in one of dull view-temperament.</p>
<p>701. (iv) Herein, as to the following ten Thread-<span class='add'>[terms]</span>, nutriment as mind-choice, the perversion that there is self in the not-self, the bond of ignorance, self-theory-assumption, the body-tie of insistence-that-only-this-is-true, the taint of ignorance, the flood of ignorance, the barb of delusion, determinations as steadying-point for consciousness passing on, and going a bad way through delusion: their meaning is one and only the phrasing is different. These are imperfections in one of intelligent view-temperament.</p>
<p>702. 1. Herein, physical nutriment and nutriment as contact come to diagnosis through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, nutriment as consciousness through the void <span class='add'>[gateway to liberation]</span>, and nutriment as mind-choice through the signless <span class='add'>[gateway to liberation]</span>.</p>
<p>703. 2. Herein, the perversion that there is beauty in the ugly and the perversion that there is pleasure in the painful come to disappearance through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, the perversion that there is permanence in the impermanent <span class='add'>[does so]</span> through the void, and the perversion that there is self in the not-self <span class='add'>[does so]</span> through the signless.</p>
<p>704. 3. Herein, sensual-desire-assumption and being-assumption come to abandonment through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, view-assumption through the void, and self-theory-assumption through the signless.</p>
<p>705. 4. Herein, the bond of sensual desire and the bond of being come to abandonment through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, the bond of views through the void, and the bond of ignorance through the signless.</p>
<p>706. 5. Herein, the body-tie of covetousness and the body-tie of ill-will come to abandonment through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli119' href='#pts-vp-pli119'>PTS vp Pli 119</a> the body-tie of misapprehension through the void, and the body-tie of insistence-that-only-this-is-true through the signless.</p>
<p>707. 6. Herein, the taint of sensual desire and the taint of being come to abandonment through the dispositionless gateway to <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en160' href='#pts-vp-en160'>PTS vp En 160</a> liberation, the taint of views through the void, and the taint of ignorance through the signless.</p>
<p>708. 7. Herein, the flood of sensual desire and the flood of being come to abandonment through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, the flood of views through the void, and the flood of ignorance through the signless.</p>
<p>709. 8. Herein, the barb of lust and the barb of hate come to abandonment through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, the barb of conceit through the void, and the barb of delusion through the signless.</p>
<p>710. 9. Herein, form as steadying-point for consciousness passing on and feeling as steadying-point for consciousness passing on come to diagnosis through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, perception as steadying-point for consciousness passing on <span class='add'>[does so]</span> through the void, and determinations as steadying-point for consciousness passing on <span class='add'>[does so]</span> through the signless.</p>
<p>711. 10. Herein, going a bad way through will and going a bad way through hate come to abandonment through the dispositionless gateway to liberation, going a bad way through fear <span class='add'>[does so]</span> through the void, and going a bad way through delusion <span class='add'>[does so]</span> through the signless.</p>
<p>712. So all the ideas that follow the world’s round find outlet from the triple world by way of the three Gateways to

<p>729. 1. Herein, the painful way with sluggish acquaintance-ship and the painful way with swift acquaintanceship are the dispositionless gateway to liberation; the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship is the void gateway to liberation; and the pleasant way with swift acquaintanceship is the signless gateway to liberation.</p>
<p>730. 2. Herein, the foundation of mindfulness as the state of a contemplator-of-the-body-as-a-body and the foundation of mindfulness as the state of a contemplator-of-feelings-as-feelings are the dispositionless gateway to liberation; the foundation of mindfulness as the state of a contemplator-of-cognizance-as-cognizance is the void gateway to liberation; and the foundation of mindfulness as the state of a contemplator-of-ideas-as-ideas is the signless gateway to liberation.</p>

<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en166' href='#pts-vp-en166'>PTS vp En 166</a>737.9. Herein, faculty-restraint and ardour are the dispositionless gateway to liberation; discovery is the void gateway to liberation; renunciation of all essentials of existence is the signless gateway to liberation.</p>
<p>738. 10.<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli124' href='#pts-vp-pli124'>PTS vp Pli 124</a>Herein, loving-kindness and compassion are the dispositionless gateway to liberation; gladness is the void gateway to liberation; and onlooking-equanimity is the signless gateway to liberation.</p>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>The Play of Lions</i>]</span></p>
<p>739. The <i>play</i> of these <span class='add'>[is as follows]</span>:</p>
<p>There are four nutriments: their opposites are the four ways. There are four perversions: their opposites are the four foundations of mindfulness. There are four assumings: their opposites are the four meditations. There are four bonds: their opposites are the four abidings. There are four ties: their opposites are the four right endeavours. There are four taints: their opposites are the four wonderful marvellous ideas. There are four floods: their opposites are the four expressions. There are four barbs: their opposites are the four ways of keeping concentration in being. There are four steadying-points for consciousness: their opposites are the four ideas that deal with pleasure. There are four goings on a bad way: their opposites are the four measureless states.</p>
<p>740. The <i>Lions</i> are the Enlightened Ones, the Hermit Enlightened Ones, and the hearers who have destroyed lust, hate, and delusion.</p>
<p>Their <i>play</i> <span class='add'>[consists in]</span> keeping in being, in verification, and in termination.</p>
<p>The <i>play</i> is the expression of the faculties <span class='add'>[beginning with faith, and]</span> the <i>play</i> is the non-expression of the pervertednesses the <span class='add'>[four]</span> faculties <span class='add'>[of energy, mindfulness, concentration, and understanding]</span> are the pasture for the true object of <span class='add'>[the faculty of]</span> faith, the pervertednesses being the pasture for defilement. This is called the Play-of -Lions Guide-Line and the Plotting-of-Directions Guide-Line. That is why it was said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en167' href='#pts-vp-en167'>PTS vp En 167</a>“The wise in Guide-Lines have called that<br>
Lions’ Play, which by the faculties<br>
Does faith’s true objects guide, and also<br>
By the perversions the defilements”,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and also</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“What mentally plots out <span class='add'>[ideas<br>
Of]</span> profit and unprofit stated<br>
Or here or there in expositions<br>
They call the Plotting of Directions”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class='add'>[<i>The Trefoil and Hook</i>]</span></p>
<p>741. Herein, those who find outlet by the painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship and <span class='add'>[by that]</span> with swift acquaintanceship are two <span class='add'>[types of]</span> persons. And those who find outlet by the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship and <span class='add'>[by that]</span> with swift acquaintanceship are two <span class='add'>[types of]</span> persons.</p>
<p>742. Corruption for those four types of persons is as follows: the four nutriments, four perversions, four assumings, four bonds, four ties, four taints, four floods, four barbs, four steadying-points for consciousness, and four goings on a bad way.</p>
<p>743. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli125' href='#pts-vp-pli125'>PTS vp Pli 125</a> Cleansing for these four types of persons is as follows: the four ways, four foundations of mindfulness, four meditations, four abidings, four right endeavours, four wonderful marvellous ideas, four expressions, four ways of keeping concentration in being, four ideas dealing with pleasure, and four measureless states.</p>
<p>744. Herein, those who find outlet by the painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship and that with swift acquaintanceship are two types of persons, and those who find outlet by the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship and that with swift acquaintanceship are two types of persons.</p>
<p>745. Herein, one who finds outlet by the pleasant way with swift acquaintanceship is one who gains knowledge from what is condensed. One who <span class='add'>[does so by both the painful way with swift <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en168' href='#pts-vp-en168'>PTS vp En 168</a> acquaintanceship and the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship]</span> in common is one who gains knowledge by what is expanded. One who finds outlet by the painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship is guidable.</p>
<p>746. Herein, the Blessed One discloses quiet to a person who gains knowledge by what is condensed, insight to one who is guidable, and quiet and insight to one who gains knowledge by what is expanded.</p>
<p>747. Herein, the Blessed One discloses a blunt teaching of the True Idea to a person who gains knowledge by what is condensed, a keen one to one who is guidable, and a blunt-to-keen one to one who gains knowledge by what is expanded.</p>
<p>748. Herein, the Blessed One teaches the True Idea in brief to a person who gains knowledge by what is condensed, in brief and in detail to one who gains knowledge by what is expanded, and in detail to one who is guidable.</p>
<p>749. Herein, the Blessed One discloses escape to a person who gains knowledge by what is condensed, disappointment and escape to a person who gains knowledge by what is expanded, and gratification, disappointment and escape to one who is guidable.</p>
<p>750. Herein, the Blessed One describes training in higher understanding to one who gains knowledge by what is condensed, training in higher cognizance to one who gains knowledge by what is expanded, and training in higher virtue to one who is guidable.</p>
<p>751. Herein, <span class='add'>[to repeat,]</span> those who find outlet by the painful way with sluggish acquaintanceship and by that with swift acquaintanceship are two types of persons. And those who find outlet by the pleasant way with sluggish acquaintanceship and by that with swift acquaintanceship are two types of persons.</p>
<p>752. <span class='add'>[But although]</span> four in this way they are <span class='add'>[yet]</span> three, namely one who gains knowledge by what is condensed, one who gains knowledge by what is expanded, and one who is guidable.</p>
<p>753. The corruption of these three types of persons is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Three roots of unprofit: greed as a root of unprofit, hate as a root of unprofit, delusion <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli126' href='#pts-vp-pli126'>PTS vp Pli 126</a> as a root of unprofit.</p>
<p>2. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en169' href='#pts-vp-en169'>PTS vp En 169</a> Three kinds of misconduct: bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct.</p>
<p>3. Three unprofitable types of thinking: thinking of sensual desires, thinking of ill-will, thinking of cruelty.</p>
<p>4. Three unprofitable types of perception: perception of sensual desires, perception of ill-will, perception of cruelty.</p>
<p>5. Three distorted types of perception: perception of permanence, perception of pleasure, perception of self ().</p>
<p>6. Three kinds of feelings: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>
<p>7. Three kinds of painfulness: painfulness in pain, painfulness in change, painfulness in determinations.</p>
<p>8. Three fires: the fire of lust, the fire of hate, the fire of delusion.</p>
<p>9. Three barbs: the barb of lust, the barb of hate, the barb of delusion.</p>
<p>10. Three tangles: the tangle of lust, the tangle of hate, the tangle of delusion ().</p>
<p>11. Three unprofitable scrutinies: unprofitable bodily action, unprofitable verbal action, unprofitable mental action.</p>
<p>12. Three failures: failure in virtue, failure in views, failure in conduct.</p>
<p>754. The cleansing of these three types of persons is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Three roots of profit: non-greed as a root of profit, non-hate as a root of profit, non-delusion as a root of profit.</p>
<p>2. Three kinds of good conduct: bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, mental good conduct.</p>
<p>3. Three profitable types of thinking: thinking of renunciation, thinking of non-ill-will, thinking of non-cruelty.</p>
<p>4. Three kinds of concentration: concentration with thinking and with exploring, concentration without thinking and with only exploring, concentration without thinking and without exploring.</p>
<p>5. Three profitable types of perception: perception of renunciation, perception of non-ill-will, perception of non-cruelty.</p>
<p>6. Three undistorted types of perception: perception of impermanence, perception of suffering, perception of not-self ().</p>
<p>7. Three profitable scrutinies: profitable bodily action, profitable verbal action, profitable mental action.</p>
<p>8. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en170' href='#pts-vp-en170'>PTS vp En 170</a> Three purenesses: bodily pureness, verbal pureness, mental pureness.</p>
<p>9. Three successes: success in virtue, success in concentration, success in understanding ().</p>
<p>10. Three trainings: training in higher virtue, training in higher concentration, training in higher understanding.</p>
<p>11. Three categories: the virtue category, the concentration category, the understanding category.</p>
<p>12. Three gateways to liberation: the void, the signless, the dispositionless.</p>
<p>755. <span class='add'>[Now although]</span> four in this way <span class='add'>[yet]</span> they are three, being three <span class='add'>[yet]</span> they are two, namely one of craving-temperament and one of view-temperament.</p>
<p>756. The corruption of these two types of persons is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Craving and ignorance,</li>
<li>consciencelessness and shamelessness,</li>
<li>unmindfulness and unawareness, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli127' href='#pts-vp-pli127'>PTS vp Pli 127</a></li>
<li><span class='add'>[unreason and]</span> unreasoned attention,</li>
<li>idleness and difficult admonishability,</li>
<li>I-making and my-making,</li>
<li>faithlessness and negligence,</li>
<li>not hearing faith’s true object, and non-restraint,</li>
<li>covetousness and ill will,</li>
<li>hindrances and fetters,</li>
<li>anger and spite,</li>
<li>contempt and domineering,</li>
<li>envy and avarice,</li>
<li><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en171' href='#pts-vp-en171'>PTS vp En 171</a>deceit and fraud,</li>
<li>the eternalist view and the annihilationist view.</li>
</ol>
<p>757. The cleansing of these two types of persons is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Quiet and insight,</li>
<li>conscience and shame,</li>
<li>mindfulness and awareness,</li>
<li><span class='add'>[reason and]</span> reasoned attention,</li>
<li>instigation of energy and easy admonishability,</li>
<li>knowledge of the True Idea and knowledge of inferences,</li>
<li>knowledge of exhaustion and knowledge of non-arising,</li>
<li>faith and diligence,</li>
<li>hearing faith’s true object and restraint,</li>
<li>uncovetousness and non-ill-will,</li>
<li>heart-deliverance due to fading of lust and understanding-deliverance due to fading of ignorance,</li>
<li>fewness of wishes and content,</li>
<li>unanger and unspitefulness,</li>
<li>uncontempt and undomineering,</li>
<li>abandoning of envy and abandoning of avarice,</li>
<li>science and deliverance,</li>
<li>the kind of liberation whose object is determined and the kind of liberation whose object is undetermined,</li>
<li>the extinction element with trace left and the extinction element without trace left.</li>
</ol>
<p>758. This is called the plane of the Trefoil Guide-Line and the Hook Guide-Line.</p>
<p>That is why it was said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Guiding <span class='add'>[ideas of]</span> profit and<br>
