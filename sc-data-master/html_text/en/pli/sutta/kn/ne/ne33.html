</header>
<p><span class='add'>[14]</span></p>
<p>630. Herein, what is the Mode of Conveying Terms of Expression in Combined Treatment? <span class='add'>[It is as follows:]</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>So let his cognizance be guarded …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>631.“So let his cognizance be guarded” is a unity.</p>
<p>Cognizance, mind, consciousness: this is a diversity.</p>
<p>632.“Having for pasture right intention” is a unity.</p>
<p>Intention of renunciation, intention of non-ill-will, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli108' href='#pts-vp-pli108'>PTS vp Pli 108</a> intention of non-cruelty: this is a diversity.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en146' href='#pts-vp-en146'>PTS vp En 146</a>633.“Giving right view first place” is a unity.</p>
<p>Right view is called knowledge about suffering, knowledge about the origin of suffering, knowledge about cessation of suffering, knowledge about the way leading to cessation of suffering knowledge about the way, knowledge about the path knowledge about a cause, knowledge about causally-arisen ideas, knowledge about a condition, knowledge about conditionally-arisen ideas; any knowing and seeing how <span class='add'>[things]</span> are in the various cases, any actualization, complete penetration, coming to truth: this is a diversity.</p>
<p>634.“Through knowing rise and fall” is a unity.</p>
<p>By means of “rise”: with ignorance as condition, determinations; with determinations as condition, consciousness; … and so all the rest … that is how there is an origin <span class='add'>[to this whole category of suffering]</span>. By means of “fall”, cessation of ignorance; with cessation of ignorance, cessation of determinations; … and so all the rest … that is how there is a cessation <span class='add'>[to this whole category of suffering]</span>. This is a diversity.</p>
<p>635.“Transcending drowsing And lethargy, a bhikkhu” is a unity.</p>
<p>“Lethargy” is a name for unwieldiness of cognizance, “drowsing” is a name for any sloth of body. This is a diversity.</p>
<p>636.“May Abandon all bad destinations” is a unity.</p>
<p>Compared with gods and human beings the states of unease are bad destinations; but compared with extinction all kinds of appearance are bad destinations. This is a diversity.</p>
