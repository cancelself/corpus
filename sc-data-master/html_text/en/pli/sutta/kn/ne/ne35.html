<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en147' href='#pts-vp-en147'>PTS vp En 147</a>639. Herein, what is the Mode of Conveying a Co-ordination in Combined Treatment? <span class='add'>[It is as follows:]</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>So let his cognizance be guarded,<br>
Having for pasture right intention,<br>
Giving right view first place through knowing<br>
Rise and fall, transcending drowsing<br>
And lethargy, a bhikkhu may<br>
Abandon all bad destinations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>640. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli109' href='#pts-vp-pli109'>PTS vp Pli 109</a> (i) “So let his cognizance be guarded” is the footing for the three kinds of good conduct. (ii) When cognizance is guarded, then, as bodily action, verbal action, and mental action, is guarded.</p>
<p>641. (iii) “Having for pasture right intention”: when right view is kept in being, the noble eight-factored path is kept in being. For what reason? Because it is from right view that right intention is given being, from right intention … <span class='add'>[complete as in 600.]</span> … from right deliverance that right knowing and seeing of deliverance is given being.</p>
<p>642. (iv) This is a person without trace left and the extinction element without trace left.</p>
<p>The Mode of Conveying a Co-ordination in Combined Treatment is ended.</p>
<p>643. That is why the venerable Mahā-Kaccāna said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Sixteen Conveyings first, Surveying<br>
With Plotting then of the Directions,<br>
And having collected with the Hook,<br>
Three Guide-Lines demonstrate a Thread”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class='end'>The Modes of Conveying in Combined Treatment are ended.</p>
