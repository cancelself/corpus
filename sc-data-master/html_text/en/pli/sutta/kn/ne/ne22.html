<p>595. Herein, what is the Mode of Conveying a Construing in
Combined Treatment? <span class='add'>[It is as follows:]</span></p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>So let his cognizance be guarded,<br>
Having for pasture right intention,<br>	
Giving right view first place through knowing<br>
Rise <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en140' href='#pts-vp-en140'>PTS vp En 140</a> and fall, transcending drowsing<br>
And lethargy, a bhikkhu may<br>
Abandon all bad destinations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“So let his cognizance be guarded, Having for pasture right intention”: this is construable thus: One with guarded cognizance will be one who has for his pasture right intention. It is construable thus: One who has for his pasture right intention will be one who has right view. It is construable thus: When he abides with right view placed first he will penetrate rise and fall. It is construable thus: When he penetrates rise and fall he will abandon all bad destinations. It is construable thus: When he abandons all bad destinations he will surmount all the fears of bad destinations and states of unease.</p>
