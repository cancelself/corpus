<p>761. Herein, corruption is of three kinds: corruption by craving, corruption by view, and corruption by misconduct.</p>
<p>762. Herein, corruption by craving is purified by quiet, and that quiet is the concentration category. Corruption by view is purified by insight, and that insight is the understanding category. Corruption by misconduct is purified by good conduct, and that good conduct is the virtue category.</p>
<p>763. When someone is established in virtue, if clutching at the kinds of being arises in him, then any quiet and insight of his becomes the ground for making merit consisting in keeping in being since it causes reappearance to occur in some kind <span class='add'>[of existence]</span> or other.</p>
<p>764. These four <span class='add'>[basic types of]</span> Threads <span class='add'>[A-D]</span>, when <span class='add'>[combined]</span> in common, come to eight; and those same eight <span class='add'>[combined]</span> in common come to sixteen. The <span class='add'>[entire]</span> Ninefold Thread is classifiable under these sixteen <span class='add'>[types thus]</span> classified.</p>

<p>942. (2) The type of Thread <i>dealing with morality</i> is for counteracting (1) the type of Thread <i>dealing with corruption</i>.

(4) The type of Thread <i>dealing with the Adept</i> has <span class='add'>[also]</span> the purpose of a pleasant abiding here and now.</p>

The type of Thread dealing with the Adept can be demonstrated by these nine types of persons.</p>
<p>That is how the supramundane type of Thread expressed in terms of creatures can be demonstrated by these thirty-six types of persons.</p>
<p>947. (i (a)) The type of Thread <i>belonging to worlds</i> (ii (a)) <i>expressed</i> <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en247' href='#pts-vp-en247'>PTS vp En 247</a> <i>in terms of creatures</i> can <span class='add'>[also]</span> be demonstrated by the <span class='add'>[following]</span> nineteen types of persons, and they are to be sought for among the types of temperament. Some are of lusting temperament, some are of hating temperament, some are of deluded temperament; some are of lusting temperament and hating temperament, some are of lusting temperament and deluded temperament, some are of hating temperament and deluded temperament, some are of lusting temperament and hating temperament and deluded temperament.</p>

The type of Thread belonging to worlds expressed in terms of creatures can be demonstrated by these nineteen types of persons.</p>
<p>948. (2) The type of Thread <i>dealing with morality</i> can be demonstrated by the types of the virtuous. These <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli191' href='#pts-vp-pli191'>PTS vp Pli 191</a> types of the virtuous are the five types of persons, namely <span class='add'>[those possessing the following ideas:]</span> natural virtue, virtue as undertaking, confidence of cognizance (heart), quiet, insight. The type of Thread dealing with morality can be demonstrated by these five types of persons.</p>
<p>949. By means of these five ideas, (1 (b)) the type of Thread <i>dissociated from worlds</i> can be demonstrated by the three types of Thread, namely (3a) that dealing with seeing, (3b) that dealing with keeping in being, and (4) that dealing with the Adept.</p>
<p>950. (i (c)) That <i>belonging to worlds and dissociated from worlds</i> <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en248' href='#pts-vp-en248'>PTS vp En 248</a> (ii (c)) <i>expressed in terms of creatures and in terms of ideas</i> can be demonstrated in both ways.</p>

<p>952. (iii (b)) The <i>knowable</i> can be demonstrated by the past, future, and presently-arisen, by the in-oneself and external, by the inferior and superior, by the far and near, by the determined and undetermined, by the profitable, unprofitable, and undeclared; or in brief by the six objects <span class='add'>[of the six bases in oneself]</span>.</p>
<p>953. (iii (c))<i>Knowledge and the knowable</i> can be demonstrated by both. And also understanding that is made the object <span class='add'>[of subsequent knowledge]</span> is the knowable; and also anything whatever, whether in-oneself or external, that is made the object <span class='add'>[of knowledge is the <i>knowable</i>, and]</span> all that can be demonstrated as determined and undetermined.</p>
<p>954. (iv (a)) <i>Seeing</i> and (iv (b)) <i>keeping in being</i>, (v (a)) <i>our own statement</i> and (v (b)) <i>someone else’s statement</i>, (vi (a)) the <i>answerable</i> and (vi (b)) the <i>unanswerable</i>, (vii (a)) <i>action</i> and (vii (b)) <i>ripening</i>, and (c) the double form in each instance, can be demonstrated appropriately by observing how it is demonstrated in the Thread; or whatever other statement the Blessed One utters can all <span class='add'>[be demonstrated]</span> by observing how it is demonstrated in the Thread.</p>
<p>955. Cause is twofold as action and as defilements. Defilements are origin.</p>
<p>956. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli192' href='#pts-vp-pli192'>PTS vp Pli 192</a> Herein, <i>defilements</i> can <span class='add'>[only]</span> be demonstrated by (1) the type of Thread <i>dealing with corruption</i>. <i>Origin</i> can be demonstrated <span class='add'>[both]</span> by (1) the type of Thread <i>dealing with corruption</i> and by (2) the type of Thread <i>dealing with morality</i>.</p>
<p>957. Herein (viii (a)) <i>the profitable</i> can be demonstrated by four types of Threads, namely (2) by that <i>dealing with morality</i>, (3a) that <i>dealing with seeing</i>, (3b) that <i>dealing with keeping in being</i>, and (4) that <i>dealing with the Adept</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en249' href='#pts-vp-en249'>PTS vp En 249</a>958. (viii (b)) <i>The unprofitable</i> can be demonstrated by (1) the type of Thread <i>dealing with corruption</i>.</p>
<p>959. (viii (c)) The <i>profitable and unprofitable</i> can be demonstrated by both <span class='add'>[as appropriate]</span>.</p>
<p>960. (ix (a)) <i>The agreed</i> can be demonstrated by what the Blessed One has agreed, which is of five kinds, namely restraint, abandoning, keeping in being, verification, and what is allowable <span class='add'>[explicitly in the texts]</span> and what is in conformity with that. Whatever is found in the several planes <span class='add'>[beginning with that of the ordinary man]</span> can be demonstrated by the allowable and what is in conformity <span class='add'>[with it]</span>.</p>
<p>961. (ix (b)) What is <i>refused</i> by the Blessed One can be demonstrated by the reason for the refusal.</p>
<p>962. (ix (c)) The <i>agreed and refused</i> can be demonstrated by both <span class='add'>[as appropriate]</span>.</p>
<p>963. (x) <i>Eulogy</i> can be demonstrated by praise. That should be understood as of five kinds, namely <span class='add'>[praise]</span> of the Blessed One, of the True Idea, of the Noble Community, of the Training in Noble Ideas, and success in mundane qualities. That is how eulogy can be demonstrated.</p>
<p>964. The plane of the faculties can be demonstrated by nine terms and the plane of defilements can be demonstrated by nine terms. So these terms are eighteen: nine profitable terms and nine unprofitable terms, according as it was said <span class='add'>[earlier]</span> “The eighteen Root-Terms: where are they to be seen? In the Pattern of the Dispensation”.</p>
<p>965. That is why the venerable Mahā-Kaccāna said:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“With nine terms on the side of profit<br>
And nine terms on unprofit’s side<br>
Construed, these Root-Terms <span class='add'>[thus]</span> do come<br>
<span class='add'>[In all]</span> to number eighteen terms”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pattern of the Dispensation is ended.</p>
