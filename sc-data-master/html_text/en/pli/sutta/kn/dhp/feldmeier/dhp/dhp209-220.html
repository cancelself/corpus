<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc209' href='#sc209' data-uid='dhp209'>SC 209</a>One who pursues what is not to be undertaken,<br>
And practices what is not to be practiced,<br>
Who clings to what is dear, having abandoned the<br>
goal:<br>
Such a one envies those who apply themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc210' href='#sc210' data-uid='dhp210'>SC 210</a>Never associate with those dear or abrasive.<br>
For not seeing those dear and seeing the abrasive are<br>
both painful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc211' href='#sc211' data-uid='dhp211'>SC 211</a>Therefore hold nothing dear,<br>
For separation from what is dear is bad.<br>
For one whom there is neither dear nor non-dear,<br>
There are no bonds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc212' href='#sc212' data-uid='dhp212'>SC 212</a>From affection grief is born.<br>
From affection fear is born.<br>
One free from affection is without grief;<br>
From where would fear come?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc213' href='#sc213' data-uid='dhp213'>SC 213</a>From love grief is born.<br>
From love fear is born.<br>
One free from love is without grief;<br>
From where would fear come?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc214' href='#sc214' data-uid='dhp214'>SC 214</a>From attachment grief is born.<br>
From attachment fear is born.<br>
One free from attachment is without grief;<br>
From where would fear come?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc215' href='#sc215' data-uid='dhp215'>SC 215</a>From sensual craving grief is born.<br>
From sensual craving fear is born.<br>
One free from sensual craving is without grief;<br>
From where would fear come?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc216' href='#sc216' data-uid='dhp216'>SC 216</a>From craving grief is born.<br>

One free from craving is without grief;<br>
From where would fear come?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc217' href='#sc217' data-uid='dhp217'>SC 217</a>People hold dear the one endowed with virtue and<br>
insight,<br>
Who speaks the truth and does the work that that is<br>
his,<br>
Who is established in the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc218' href='#sc218' data-uid='dhp218'>SC 218</a>One with an expansive mind,<br>
Who is intent on the Indescribable,<br>
Whose heart is not bound with sensual craving,<br>
is called going upstream.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc219' href='#sc219' data-uid='dhp219'>SC 219</a>Family, companions, and friends rejoice<br>
When one, long absent, safely returns.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc220' href='#sc220' data-uid='dhp220'>SC 220</a>Just so, in going from this world to the next,<br>
The good deeds receive the well-doer,<br>
As relatives receive the return of their dear one.</p>
