<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc179' href='#sc179' data-uid='dhp179'>SC 179</a>He whose victory cannot be undone,<br>
A conquest no one in the world can pursue:<br>
This is the Buddha, trackless in an endless field.<br>
By what path would you guide him?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc180' href='#sc180' data-uid='dhp180'>SC 180</a>The one who has no snare,<br>
No craving, no thirst to carry him anywhere:<br>
This is the Buddha, trackless in an endless field.<br>
By what path would you guide him?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc181' href='#sc181' data-uid='dhp181'>SC 181</a>The wise, intent on meditation,<br>
Delighting in renunciation and calm,<br>
Wholly awakened and mindful:<br>
Even the gods envy them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc182' href='#sc182' data-uid='dhp182'>SC 182</a>Difficult it is to gain a human birth;<br>
Difficult is the life of mortals;<br>
Difficult is the chance to hear the true Dhamma;<br>
Difficult is the arising of Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc183' href='#sc183' data-uid='dhp183'>SC 183</a>Doing no evil,<br>
Undertaking the good,<br>
Purifying one’s mind:<br>
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc184' href='#sc184' data-uid='dhp184'>SC 184</a>One who hurts another is no monk.<br>
One who harms another is no renunciant.<br>
Patience and endurance make the highest asceticism.<br>
The Buddhas teach that Nibbāna is supreme.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc185' href='#sc185' data-uid='dhp185'>SC 185</a>Not disparaging or hurting others,<br>
Restrained by the precepts, moderate in food,<br>
Dwelling in solitude, pursuing high states of mind:<br>
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc186' href='#sc186' data-uid='dhp186'>SC 186</a>Not even by a rain of coins would people have their<br>
fill of sense pleasures.<br>
The wise one knows they satisfy little and cause<br>
pain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc187' href='#sc187' data-uid='dhp187'>SC 187</a>He does not even delight in heavenly pleasures.<br>
The disciple of the Wholly Awakened One is<br>
devoted to craving’s destruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc188' href='#sc188' data-uid='dhp188'>SC 188</a>People driven by fear seek many refuges,<br>
Whether mountains, forests, or shrine parks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc189' href='#sc189' data-uid='dhp189'>SC 189</a>But such a refuge is not safe, surely not supreme.<br>
Arriving at such a refuge, one is not free from all<br>
suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc190' href='#sc190' data-uid='dhp190'>SC 190</a>But one who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the<br>
Dhamma, and the Sangha,<br>
Sees, with true wisdom, the Four Noble Truths:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc191' href='#sc191' data-uid='dhp191'>SC 191</a>Suffering, the origin of suffering, the overcoming of<br>
suffering,<br>
And the Eightfold Path leading to the cessation of<br>
suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc192' href='#sc192' data-uid='dhp192'>SC 192</a>Truly, this refuge is safe, this refuge is supreme.<br>
Having come to this refuge, one is truly freed from<br>
all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc193' href='#sc193' data-uid='dhp193'>SC 193</a>A remarkable man is hard to find;<br>
He is not born everywhere.<br>
Where such a wise one is born<br>
His family happily flourishes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc194' href='#sc194' data-uid='dhp194'>SC 194</a>Happy the birth of the Buddhas;<br>
Happy the teaching of the true Dhamma;<br>
Happy the harmony of the Sangha;<br>
Happy the austere practice of those in harmony.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc195' href='#sc195' data-uid='dhp195'>SC 195</a>If one venerates those worthy of veneration,<br>
Buddhas or their disciples,<br>
Beings who have transcended proliferations<br>
And passed beyond grief and sorrow,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc196' href='#sc196' data-uid='dhp196'>SC 196</a>Beings who are free and fear nothing—<br>
If one venerates such beings, the merit cannot be<br>
measured.</p>
