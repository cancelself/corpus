<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21' data-uid='dhp21'>SC 21</a>Vigilance is the path to the deathless state.<br>
Negligence is the path to death.<br>
The vigilant do not die;<br>
The negligent are as if already dead.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22' data-uid='dhp22'>SC 22</a>Knowing this distinction,<br>
Those wise in vigilance rejoice therein,<br>
Delighting in the field of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23' data-uid='dhp23'>SC 23</a>Absorbed in meditation,<br>
with perseverance and constant effort,<br>
The wise touch Nibbāna,<br>
that ultimate shelter from bondage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24' data-uid='dhp24'>SC 24</a>For one who is vigilant and restrained,<br>
Who is energetic and mindful,<br>
Who acts carefully and purely,<br>
Who lives the Dhamma,<br>
Fame grows.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25' href='#sc25' data-uid='dhp25'>SC 25</a>Through effort, vigilance, restraint, and self-<br>
control,<br>
The wise one makes himself an island that a flood<br>
could not overwhelm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26' data-uid='dhp26'>SC 26</a>The ignorant and foolish give themselves to<br>
negligence,<br>
While the wise protect vigilance as the supreme<br>
treasure.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27' data-uid='dhp27'>SC 27</a>Do not give yourself to negligence<br>
Or be intimate with sensual pleasure.<br>
Being meditative and vigilant,<br>
One attains great happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28' data-uid='dhp28'>SC 28</a>When the wise one expels negligence by vigilance,<br>
Having ascended to the stronghold of wisdom,<br>
And free from sorrow,<br>
He observes the sorrowing crowd,<br>
As a sage, standing on a mountain,<br>
Observes fools on the plain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29' data-uid='dhp29'>SC 29</a>Vigilant among the negligent,<br>
Wide awake among the sleeping,<br>
The deeply wise one goes forth,<br>
Like a swift horse who leaves the nag behind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30' data-uid='dhp30'>SC 30</a>By vigilance,<br>
Indra went to the highest seat among the gods.<br>
Vigilance they praise; negligence is ever-derided.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc31' href='#sc31' data-uid='dhp31'>SC 31</a>The monk, devoted to vigilance and seeing the<br>
danger in negligence,<br>
Goes forth like a fire burning every fetter,<br>
gross and subtle.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc32' href='#sc32' data-uid='dhp32'>SC 32</a>The monk, devoted to vigilance and seeing the<br>
danger in negligence,<br>
Is close to Nibbāna and cannot regress.</p>
