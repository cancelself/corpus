<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc146' href='#sc146' data-uid='dhp146'>SC 146</a>Why laughter, why joy,<br>
While ever-aflame?<br>
Covered in darkness,<br>
Do you not seek the light?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc147' href='#sc147' data-uid='dhp147'>SC 147</a>Look at this beautified image, with many plans—<br>
A diseased mass of sores that has no permanence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc148' href='#sc148' data-uid='dhp148'>SC 148</a>This body, a nest of illness that is wasted away,<br>
This foul mass breaks up,<br>
For truly life ends in death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc149' href='#sc149' data-uid='dhp149'>SC 149</a>On seeing these gray bones,<br>
Scattered like gourds in autumn—<br>
What is the fondness?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc150' href='#sc150' data-uid='dhp150'>SC 150</a>It (the body) is a city made of bones, plastered in<br>
flesh and blood,<br>
Where old age, death, conceit, and hypocrisy are<br>
stored.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc151' href='#sc151' data-uid='dhp151'>SC 151</a>Even the king’s chariots, so splendidly adorned,<br>
decay.<br>
Alas, the body too decays.<br>
But the Dhamma of the good does not age;<br>
Indeed, the good declare it to one another.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc152' href='#sc152' data-uid='dhp152'>SC 152</a>He of little learning grows old like an ox;<br>
His bulk increases, but his wisdom does not.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc153' href='#sc153' data-uid='dhp153'>SC 153</a>Through many rounds of birth have I run,<br>
Seeking and not finding the builder of this house.<br>
Painful is birth, again and again.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc154' href='#sc154' data-uid='dhp154'>SC 154</a>House-builder you are seen! You will build no<br>
more!<br>
Your rafters are broken, the roof destroyed.<br>
The mind, having gone to the Unconditioned,<br>
Has attained the destruction of craving.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc155' href='#sc155' data-uid='dhp155'>SC 155</a>Not having lived a holy life,<br>
Not having obtained wealth in youth,<br>
They brood,<br>
Like old herons in a lake without fish.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc156' href='#sc156' data-uid='dhp156'>SC 156</a>Not having lived a holy life,<br>
Not having attained wealth in their youth,<br>
They lie like arrows shot from a bow,<br>
Lamenting the past.</p>
