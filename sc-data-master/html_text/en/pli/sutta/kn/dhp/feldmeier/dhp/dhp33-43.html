<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33' data-uid='dhp33'>SC 33</a>The mind is wavering and unsteady,<br>
Difficult to guard, hard to restrain.<br>
The wise one sets it straight,<br>
As a fletcher straightens the arrow’s shaft.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34' data-uid='dhp34'>SC 34</a>Like a fish thrown on land from its home in the<br>
water,<br>
This mind thrashes to escape Māra’s realm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc35' href='#sc35' data-uid='dhp35'>SC 35</a>Good is the taming of the mind,<br>
So difficult to control, so swift,<br>
Jumping toward what it desires.<br>
The tamed mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc36' href='#sc36' data-uid='dhp36'>SC 36</a>The wise should guard the mind,<br>
So difficult to perceive, so subtle,<br>
Jumping at what it desires.<br>
The protected mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc37' href='#sc37' data-uid='dhp37'>SC 37</a>The mind wanders far and alone,<br>
Incorporeal and resting in the cavern (of the body).<br> 
Those who restrain it <br>
will be released from Māra’s bonds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc38' href='#sc38' data-uid='dhp38'>SC 38</a>Wisdom does not mature in one of unsteady mind<br>
And drifting faith,<br>
Who knows not the true Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc39' href='#sc39' data-uid='dhp39'>SC 39</a>For the one who is awake,<br>
Whose mind is neither afflicted nor filled with desire,<br>
Who has transcended merit and demerit,<br>
There is no fear.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc40' href='#sc40' data-uid='dhp40'>SC 40</a>Having understood this body as a clay pot,<br>
Having established this mind as a fortress,<br>
One should battle Māra with the sword of wisdom,<br>
And protect what has been conquered, clinging to nothing.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc41' href='#sc41' data-uid='dhp41'>SC 41</a>Soon indeed, this body will lie on the earth,<br>
Without consciousness,<br>
Cast away as a worthless log.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc42' href='#sc42' data-uid='dhp42'>SC 42</a>Whatever an enemy would do to an enemy,<br>
A hater to one hated,<br>
Worse than that is the harm that a wrongly directed<br>
mind can do to itself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc43' href='#sc43' data-uid='dhp43'>SC 43</a>Whatever mother, father, or other relative may do,<br>
Better still, the good that a well-directed<br>
mind can do for itself.</p>
