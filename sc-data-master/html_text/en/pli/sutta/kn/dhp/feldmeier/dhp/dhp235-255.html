<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc235' href='#sc235' data-uid='dhp235'>SC 235</a>You are now like a yellowed leaf.<br>
Even Yama’s men have come for you.<br>
You stand at the mouth of death,<br>
With no provisions for the journey.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc236' href='#sc236' data-uid='dhp236'>SC 236</a>Make an island for yourself.<br>
Strive quickly. Be wise.<br>
Clear, with impurities removed,<br>
You will enter the divine realm of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc237' href='#sc237' data-uid='dhp237'>SC 237</a>And now, with life almost finished,<br>
You have entered into Yama’s presence.<br>
There is no place to rest in between;<br>
There are no provisions for the journey.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc238' href='#sc238' data-uid='dhp238'>SC 238</a>Make an island for yourself.<br>
Strive quickly. Be wise.<br>
Clear, with impurities removed,<br>
You will not come to birth and old age again.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc239' href='#sc239' data-uid='dhp239'>SC 239</a>Like a metal-smith who,<br>
Little-by-little, moment-by-moment,<br>
Cleanses dross from silver,<br>
So too the wise one cleanses his impurities<br>
gradually.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc240' href='#sc240' data-uid='dhp240'>SC 240</a>Just as rust eats the iron from which it has arisen,<br>
So the monk who lives excessively<br>
Is led by his own deeds into a woeful rebirth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc241' href='#sc241' data-uid='dhp241'>SC 241</a>Sacred texts are profaned by non-recitation;<br>
Houses are broken down by neglect;<br>
Beauty is compromised by sloth;<br>
And vigilance is undermined by negligence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc242' href='#sc242' data-uid='dhp242'>SC 242</a>Bad conduct is the impurity of a woman.<br>
Stinginess, the impurity of a giver.<br>
Impurities are evil things,<br>
In this world and in the next.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc243' href='#sc243' data-uid='dhp243'>SC 243</a>More impure than these is ignorance,<br>
This is the supreme impurity.<br>
Having renounced this impurity,<br>
O monks, be pure.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc244' href='#sc244' data-uid='dhp244'>SC 244</a>Easy to live is the life of the shameless,<br>
The unconscientious, offensive, pushy, reckless, and<br>
corrupt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc245' href='#sc245' data-uid='dhp245'>SC 245</a>Hard to live is the life of one with conscience,<br>
Who always strives to be pure,<br>
Who is open, careful, perceptive, and clean-living.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc246' href='#sc246' data-uid='dhp246'>SC 246</a>Whoever kills a living being,<br>
Speaks falsely,<br>
Takes whatever in the world is not given,<br>
Goes to another’s wife,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc247' href='#sc247' data-uid='dhp247'>SC 247</a>And gives himself to drinking liquor,<br>
Uproots himself in this very world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc248' href='#sc248' data-uid='dhp248'>SC 248</a>Know this friend: evil things are reckless.<br>
Let not greed and injustice subject you to long<br>
suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc249' href='#sc249' data-uid='dhp249'>SC 249</a>People give according to their faith, according to<br>
their trust.<br>
The one who is disconcerted by others’ food and<br>
drink,<br>
Will never attain samādhi, neither by day nor by<br>
night.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc250' href='#sc250' data-uid='dhp250'>SC 250</a>But one who has cut off, destroyed at the root,<br>
And removed this consternation,<br>
Will attain samādhi, day or night.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc251' href='#sc251' data-uid='dhp251'>SC 251</a>There is no fire like passion;<br>
There is no fetter like ill will;<br>
There is no snare like delusion;<br>
There is no river like craving.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc252' href='#sc252' data-uid='dhp252'>SC 252</a>It is easy to see the faults of others,<br>
But truly difficult to see one’s own.<br>
One sifts out the faults of others like chaff,<br>
But conceals one’s own,<br>
As a deceitful gambler conceals a corrupt dice<br>
throw.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc253' href='#sc253' data-uid='dhp253'>SC 253</a>The one who finds faults with others,<br>
Always watching and critical:<br>
His toxins only grow ever-farther from their<br>
dissolution.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc254' href='#sc254' data-uid='dhp254'>SC 254</a>There are no tracks in the sky;<br>
The renunciant is not outside;<br>
People delight in impediments;<br>
The Tathāgatas are without impediments.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc255' href='#sc255' data-uid='dhp255'>SC 255</a>There are no tracks in the sky;<br>
The renunciant is not outside;<br>
No conditioned things are eternal;<br>
Unshaken are the Buddhas.</p>
