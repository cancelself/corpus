<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc100' href='#sc100' data-uid='dhp100'>SC 100</a>Better than a thousand vacuous statements<br>
Is one meaningful word,<br>
Which, having been heard, brings peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc101' href='#sc101' data-uid='dhp101'>SC 101</a>Better than a thousand vacuous verses<br>
Is one line of verse,<br>
Which, having been heard, brings peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc102' href='#sc102' data-uid='dhp102'>SC 102</a>Better than a recitation of one hundred meaningless<br>
verses<br>
is one Dhamma word,<br>
Which, having been heard, brings peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc103' href='#sc103' data-uid='dhp103'>SC 103</a>Greater in battle than one who conquers thousands<br>
upon thousands<br>
Is the one who conquers himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc104' href='#sc104' data-uid='dhp104'>SC 104</a>It is better to conquer oneself than others.<br>
For the self-tamed one, ever-vigilant in self-control,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc105' href='#sc105' data-uid='dhp105'>SC 105</a>Neither a god nor a divine musician,<br>
Nor Māra and Brahmā together,<br>
Could turn such a victory into defeat.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc106' href='#sc106' data-uid='dhp106'>SC 106</a>Better than offering a thousand sacrifices,<br>
Month after month for a hundred years,<br>
Is one moment’s homage<br>
To one who has developed himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc107' href='#sc107' data-uid='dhp107'>SC 107</a>Better than one hundred years dwelling in the forest<br>
And tending the sacred fire,<br>
Is one moment’s homage<br>
To one who has developed himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc108' href='#sc108' data-uid='dhp108'>SC 108</a>Whatever offering or sacrifice in the world<br>
A merit-seeker might offer for a year,<br>
All this is not one-fourth the merit gained<br>
From showing respect to the upright.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc109' href='#sc109' data-uid='dhp109'>SC 109</a>For one who is respectful,<br>
Who constantly reveres the elders,<br>
Four things grow: life, beauty, happiness, and<br>
strength.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc110' href='#sc110' data-uid='dhp110'>SC 110</a>Better than living one hundred years,<br>
Immoral and ungrounded,<br>
Is living one day,<br>
Virtuous and absorbed in meditation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc111' href='#sc111' data-uid='dhp111'>SC 111</a>Better than living one hundred years,<br>
Foolish and ungrounded,<br>
Is living one day,<br>
Wise and absorbed in meditation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc112' href='#sc112' data-uid='dhp112'>SC 112</a>Better than living one hundred years,<br>
Indolent and slothful,<br>
Is living one day<br>
With steadfast vigor.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc113' href='#sc113' data-uid='dhp113'>SC 113</a>Better than living one hundred years<br>
Without seeing arising and dissipation,<br>
Is living one day,<br>
Seeing arising and dissipation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc114' href='#sc114' data-uid='dhp114'>SC 114</a>Better than living one hundred years<br>
Without seeing the deathless way,<br>
Is living one day,<br>
Seeing the deathless way.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc115' href='#sc115' data-uid='dhp115'>SC 115</a>Better than living one hundred years<br>
Without seeing the supreme Dhamma,<br>
Is living one day,<br>
Seeing the supreme Dhamma.</p>
