<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc360' href='#sc360' data-uid='dhp360'>SC 360</a>Restraint of the eye is good.<br>
Good is restraint of the ear.<br>
Restraint of the nose is good.<br>
Good is restraint of the tongue.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc361' href='#sc361' data-uid='dhp361'>SC 361</a>Restraint of the body is good.<br>
Good is restraint of speech.<br>
Restraint of the mind is good.<br>
Good is restraint everywhere.<br>
The monk, restrained in every way,<br>
Is released from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc362' href='#sc362' data-uid='dhp362'>SC 362</a>The one restrained in hand, foot, and speech<br>
the fully restrained—<br>
Who is composed, solitary, and contented,<br>
Who delights within:<br>
This one is truly proclaimed a monk</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc363' href='#sc363' data-uid='dhp363'>SC 363</a>Sweet is the speech of the humble monk,<br>
Who restrains his mouth, recites the sacred texts,<br>
And illuminates the Dhamma and its meaning.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc364' href='#sc364' data-uid='dhp364'>SC 364</a>The monk, delighting in the Dhamma,<br>
Devoted to the Dhamma,<br>
Pondering the Dhamma, and<br>
Remembering the Dhamma,<br>
Does not fall from the true Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc365' href='#sc365' data-uid='dhp365'>SC 365</a>Scorn not what you have obtained,<br>
Nor be envious of others.<br>
The jealous monk does not attain samādhi.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc366' href='#sc366' data-uid='dhp366'>SC 366</a>The monk who never scorns what he has obtained,<br>
Even if little,<br>
Who is unwearied and lives the pure life,<br>
Is praised, even by the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc367' href='#sc367' data-uid='dhp367'>SC 367</a>The one who is not fond of mine,<br>
Of anything of name-and-form;<br>
Who does not grieve for what is not:<br>
Truly, he is called monk.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc368' href='#sc368' data-uid='dhp368'>SC 368</a>The monk abiding in loving-kindness and<br>
Pleased in the Buddha’s teaching,<br>
Acquires the peaceful state,<br>
The quieting of all conditioned things:<br>
Happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc369' href='#sc369' data-uid='dhp369'>SC 369</a>O monk, bail out this boat!<br>
Emptied, it will go quickly for you.<br>
Having destroyed passion and ill will,<br>
You will go to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc370' href='#sc370' data-uid='dhp370'>SC 370</a>Five (gross fetters) one should cut off.<br>
Five (subtle fetters) one should abandon.<br>
And further five (faculties) one should develop.<br>
The monk who has overcome the five attachments<br>
Is called one who has crossed over the torrent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc371' href='#sc371' data-uid='dhp371'>SC 371</a>Meditate O monk! Do not be negligent!<br>
Do not let your mind whirl in sensual pleasure;<br>
Do not, being negligent, swallow the molten ball;</p>
Do not, while burning, cry out, “This is suffering!”
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc372' href='#sc372' data-uid='dhp372'>SC 372</a>There is no meditative depth for the one without<br>
discernment,<br>
And no discernment for the one who does not<br>
practice meditation.<br>
But one with both wisdom and concentration<br>
Is indeed close to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc373' href='#sc373' data-uid='dhp373'>SC 373</a>For the monk who enters solitude,<br>
With mind at peace,<br>
Penetrating the Dhamma thoroughly,<br>
There is heavenly delight.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc374' href='#sc374' data-uid='dhp374'>SC 374</a>When one penetrates the arising and dissipation of<br>
the aggregates,<br>
One obtains joy and delight.<br>
For those who know,<br>
This is the Deathless.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc375' href='#sc375' data-uid='dhp375'>SC 375</a>For the wise monk, here is the beginning:<br>
Guarding one’s senses, contentment,<br>
Restraint by the monastic precepts,<br>
Association with virtuous friends<br>
Whose way of life is pure and unwearied.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc376' href='#sc376' data-uid='dhp376'>SC 376</a>Be friendly and of good will;<br>
Be skillful in conduct.<br>
Thus would you end suffering<br>
And be filled with joy.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc377' href='#sc377' data-uid='dhp377'>SC 377</a>Just as the jasmine sheds its withered flowers,<br>
So, O monks, you should shed passion and ill will.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc378' href='#sc378' data-uid='dhp378'>SC 378</a>The monk who is calm in body and speech,<br>
Tranquil and centered,<br>
Caring not for worldly gain:<br>
He is called at peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc379' href='#sc379' data-uid='dhp379'>SC 379</a>You yourself ought to exhort yourself.<br>
You yourself ought to scrutinize yourself.<br>
The monk who is self-guarded and mindful<br>
Will dwell happily.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc380' href='#sc380' data-uid='dhp380'>SC 380</a>You are your own protector;<br>
You are your own guide.<br>
Therefore, restrain yourself,<br>
Like a merchant a fine horse.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc381' href='#sc381' data-uid='dhp381'>SC 381</a>The monk, full of joy, pleased in the Buddha’s<br>
teaching,<br>
Acquires the peaceful state,<br>
The quieting of all conditioned things:<br>
Happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc382' href='#sc382' data-uid='dhp382'>SC 382</a>Engaged in the Buddha’s teaching,<br>
Even a novice monk illumines this world,<br>
Like the moon released from a cloud.</p>
