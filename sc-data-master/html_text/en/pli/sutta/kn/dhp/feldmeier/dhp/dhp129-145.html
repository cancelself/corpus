<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc129' href='#sc129' data-uid='dhp129'>SC 129</a>All tremble at a thrashing.<br>
All fear death.<br>
Likening others to oneself,<br>
Do not kill or lead another to kill.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc130' href='#sc130' data-uid='dhp130'>SC 130</a>All tremble at a thrashing.<br>
All hold life dear.<br>
Likening others to oneself,<br>
Do not kill or lead another to kill.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc131' href='#sc131' data-uid='dhp131'>SC 131</a>One who himself seeks happiness,<br>
And yet hurts others who desire happiness,<br>
Will realize no happiness after death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc132' href='#sc132' data-uid='dhp132'>SC 132</a>One who himself seeks happiness,<br>
And does not hurt others who desire happiness,<br>
Will realize happiness after death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc133' href='#sc133' data-uid='dhp133'>SC 133</a>To none speak harshly.<br>
Those spoken to would respond in kind.<br>
Contentious speech is painful;<br>
Retaliation would befall you.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc134' href='#sc134' data-uid='dhp134'>SC 134</a>If, like a broken gong,<br>
You yourself are unstirred,<br>
You have attained Nibbāna,<br>
And no contention exists within.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc135' href='#sc135' data-uid='dhp135'>SC 135</a>Just as a cowherd drives a cow to pasture with a stick,<br>
So old age and death drive the life of sentient beings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc136' href='#sc136' data-uid='dhp136'>SC 136</a>A fool does not recognize his own evil act.<br>
Devoid of wisdom, he is tormented by his actions,<br>
As one burned by fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc137' href='#sc137' data-uid='dhp137'>SC 137</a>One who does violence to the innocent and<br>
peaceable<br>
Will quickly encounter one of ten states:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc138' href='#sc138' data-uid='dhp138'>SC 138</a>Intense pain, destitution, bodily injury, disease of<br>
body, disease of mind,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc139' href='#sc139' data-uid='dhp139'>SC 139</a>Oppression from the king, cruel slander, loss of<br>
relatives, loss of wealth,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc140' href='#sc140' data-uid='dhp140'>SC 140</a>Loss of houses by fire;<br>
And after death, such a one, so devoid of wisdom,<br>
will be reborn in hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc141' href='#sc141' data-uid='dhp141'>SC 141</a>Neither nakedness nor matted hair,<br>
Neither a mud-smeared body nor fasting,<br>
Neither lying on the ground, nor dust and sweat,<br>
Nor sitting on one’s heels,<br>
Can purify one who has not overcome doubt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc142' href='#sc142' data-uid='dhp142'>SC 142</a>Even if one would walk around luxuriously attired,<br>
If one is tranquil, tame, self-restrained, and living a<br>
holy life,<br>
Having renounced violence toward any living being,<br>
Such is a brahmin, a renunciant, a monk.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc143' href='#sc143' data-uid='dhp143'>SC 143</a>Where in this world exists<br>
One who is restrained by conscience and avoids<br>
blame,<br>
As a good horse avoids the whip?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc144' href='#sc144' data-uid='dhp144'>SC 144</a>Be like a good horse when touched by the whip—<br>
ardent and alarmed.<br>
Through strength, virtue, and vigor,<br>
Through concentration and investigation of truth,<br>
Mindful and possessed of right knowledge and<br>
conduct,<br>
You will leave this great suffering behind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc145' href='#sc145' data-uid='dhp145'>SC 145</a>Irrigators guide water;<br>
Fletchers straighten shafts;<br>
Carpenters bend wood;<br>
The well-practiced master themselves.</p>
