<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc320' href='#sc320' data-uid='dhp320'>SC 320</a>As an elephant in battle endures arrows shot from<br>
bows,<br>
So shall I endure insult.<br>
Truly, the masses are immoral.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc321' href='#sc321' data-uid='dhp321'>SC 321</a>It is the tamed one they lead into the crowd.<br>
It is the tamed one that the king mounts.<br>
Among humans, best is the tamed one<br>
Who endures insult.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc322' href='#sc322' data-uid='dhp322'>SC 322</a>Excellent are tamed mules,<br>
Thoroughbred horses of Sindh, and great elephants,<br>
tuskers.<br>
More excellent than these is the one who tames<br>
himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc323' href='#sc323' data-uid='dhp323'>SC 323</a>For not by these mounts could one go to the<br>
unreached region,<br>
As one tamed goes well-tamed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc324' href='#sc324' data-uid='dhp324'>SC 324</a>A tusker named Dhanapālaka,<br>
Bound, difficult to restrain, and rutting,<br>
Does not eat even a morsel;<br>
He longs for the elephant grove.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc325' href='#sc325' data-uid='dhp325'>SC 325</a>The sluggish and gluttonous,<br>
The sleeper, who lies rolling around,<br>
Being dull like a great boar nourished on fodder,<br>
Undergoes rebirth again and again.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc326' href='#sc326' data-uid='dhp326'>SC 326</a>Formerly, this mind went wandering as it wished,<br>
According to its desire and pleasure.<br>
Today, I will restrain it thoroughly,<br>
As an elephant driver subdues a rutting elephant.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc327' href='#sc327' data-uid='dhp327'>SC 327</a>Be devoted to vigilance;<br>
Guard your mind.<br>
Raise yourself from the bad path,<br>
Like a tusker sunk in mud.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc328' href='#sc328' data-uid='dhp328'>SC 328</a>If you should find an intelligent companion,<br>
A fellow-traveler who is wise and virtuous,<br>
You should journey together, joyful and mindful,<br>
Overcoming all dangers.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc329' href='#sc329' data-uid='dhp329'>SC 329</a>If you should not find an intelligent companion,<br>
A fellow-traveler who is wise and virtuous,<br>
Then journey alone,<br>
Like a king who has abandoned a conquered<br>
kingdom,<br>
Like the elephant in the Mātaṅga forest.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc330' href='#sc330' data-uid='dhp330'>SC 330</a>It is better to travel alone; there is no<br>
companionship with a fool.<br>
Go alone, wanting little, and doing no wrong,<br>
Like the elephant in the Mātaṅga forest.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc331' href='#sc331' data-uid='dhp331'>SC 331</a>Happy are friends when need arises.<br>
Happy is contentment in whatever is.<br>
Happy is a meritorious deed at the end of life.<br>
Happy is the abandonment of suffering altogether.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc332' href='#sc332' data-uid='dhp332'>SC 332</a>Happy in this world is reverence toward one’s<br>
mother,<br>
And reverence for one’s father as well.<br>
Happy in this world is reverence toward a<br>
renunciant.<br>
Happy is respect for the brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc333' href='#sc333' data-uid='dhp333'>SC 333</a>Happy is virtue through old age.<br>
Happy is a firmly established faith.<br>
Happy is the attainment of wisdom.<br>
Happy is doing no wrong.</p>
