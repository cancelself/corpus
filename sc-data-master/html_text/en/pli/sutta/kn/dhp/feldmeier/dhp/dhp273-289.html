<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc273' href='#sc273' data-uid='dhp273'>SC 273</a>Of paths, the eightfold is supreme;<br>
Of truths, the four proclamations;<br>
Of mental states, dispassion;<br>
Of people, the truly perceptive.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc274' href='#sc274' data-uid='dhp274'>SC 274</a>Only this is the path;<br>
There is no other for purity of vision.<br>
Follow this, the path that bewilders Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc275' href='#sc275' data-uid='dhp275'>SC 275</a>Following this path,<br>
You will truly put an end to suffering.<br>
This is the path I have proclaimed,<br>
Having known the arrow’s removal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc276' href='#sc276' data-uid='dhp276'>SC 276</a>The effort must be done by you.<br>
The tathāgatas are only proclaimers.<br>
Following the path, those absorbed in meditation<br>
Will be freed from Māra’s bonds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc277' href='#sc277' data-uid='dhp277'>SC 277</a>When one perceives with wisdom<br>
That all conditioned things are impermanent,<br>
Then one wearies of suffering.<br>
This is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc278' href='#sc278' data-uid='dhp278'>SC 278</a>When one perceives with wisdom<br>
That all conditioned things are suffering,<br>
Then one wearies of suffering.<br>
This is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc279' href='#sc279' data-uid='dhp279'>SC 279</a>When one perceives with wisdom<br>
That all things are without self,<br>
Then one wearies of suffering.<br>
This is the path to purity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc280' href='#sc280' data-uid='dhp280'>SC 280</a>The one who is inactive at a time for exertion,<br>
Who though young and strong is slothful,<br>
Who is lazy, lethargic,<br>
Whose mind’s resolves are exhausted;<br>
Such a one will not find the path of wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc281' href='#sc281' data-uid='dhp281'>SC 281</a>Guarded in speech, restrained in mind and body,<br>
Do nothing unwholesome.<br>
Purify these three ways of action,<br>
And complete the path proclaimed by the wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc282' href='#sc282' data-uid='dhp282'>SC 282</a>From practice wisdom arises;<br>
From lack of practice wisdom is lost.<br>
Having recognized this twofold path of<br>
development and decline,<br>
Establish yourself so that wisdom grows.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc283' href='#sc283' data-uid='dhp283'>SC 283</a>Cut down the entire forest (of passion), not just one<br>
tree.<br>
From the forest, fear is born.<br>
Having cut down the forest and underbrush,<br>
O monks, be deforested.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc284' href='#sc284' data-uid='dhp284'>SC 284</a>As long as the underbrush (of passion) is not cut<br>
down,<br>
And even the smallest amount of sexual passion<br>
remains,<br>
One’s mind remains tethered,<br>
Like a calf sucking milk from its mother.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc285' href='#sc285' data-uid='dhp285'>SC 285</a>Cut off affection for self,<br>
As you would an autumn lotus with your hand.<br>
Cultivate the path of tranquility,<br>
To Nibbāna, taught by the Well-Gone One.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc286' href='#sc286' data-uid='dhp286'>SC 286</a>“Here I will stay during the rains,<br>
Here for winter and summer,” so thinks the fool.<br>
He does not recognize the danger.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc287' href='#sc287' data-uid='dhp287'>SC 287</a>Death takes that man with mind attached,<br>
Intoxicated by sons and cattle,<br>
Like a great flood takes a sleeping village.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc288' href='#sc288' data-uid='dhp288'>SC 288</a>There are no sons for protection, or father or even<br>
kin,<br>
There is no protection in relatives for one seized by<br>
death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc289' href='#sc289' data-uid='dhp289'>SC 289</a>Knowing this, governed by virtue,<br>
The wise should quickly clear the path leading to<br>
Nibbāna.</p>
