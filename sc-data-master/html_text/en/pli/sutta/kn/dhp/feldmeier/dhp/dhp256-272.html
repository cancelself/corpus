<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc256' href='#sc256' data-uid='dhp256'>SC 256</a>One who hastily assesses what is good<br>
Is not established in Dhamma.<br>
The wise one investigates both good and bad,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc257' href='#sc257' data-uid='dhp257'>SC 257</a>And judges others thoughtfully, justly, and<br>
impartially.<br>
This intelligent one, this protector of the Dhamma,<br>
Is called established in the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc258' href='#sc258' data-uid='dhp258'>SC 258</a>One is not wise in virtue of speaking much.<br>
One who is called wise is peaceful, friendly, and<br>
fearless.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc259' href='#sc259' data-uid='dhp259'>SC 259</a>One does not uphold the Dhamma simply by many<br>
words.<br>
One upholds the Dhamma when it is not neglected;<br>
When, having heard but a little, observes it with<br>
one’s own body.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc260' href='#sc260' data-uid='dhp260'>SC 260</a>One is not an elder just by a gray head.<br>
Ripe only in years, he is called grown old in vain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc261' href='#sc261' data-uid='dhp261'>SC 261</a>But one in whom there is truth and Dhamma,<br>
Non-violence, restraint, and moderation,<br>
With impurities discarded,<br>
This wise one is truly called elder.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc262' href='#sc262' data-uid='dhp262'>SC 262</a>Not by eloquence or lotus-like beauty,<br>
does one who is envious, selfish, and deceitful,<br>
become exemplary.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc263' href='#sc263' data-uid='dhp263'>SC 263</a>The wise one who has cut off, destroyed at the root,<br>
and removed these;<br>
Who has discarded ill will altogether;<br>
This one is called exemplary.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc264' href='#sc264' data-uid='dhp264'>SC 264</a>Not by a bald head is one a renunciant—<br>
One who does not observe the precepts, who lies.<br>
What renunciant is possessed by longing and greed!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc265' href='#sc265' data-uid='dhp265'>SC 265</a>But one who subdues evil thoroughly, whether big<br>
or small,<br>
Is by so doing truly called renunciant.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc266' href='#sc266' data-uid='dhp266'>SC 266</a>One is not a monk just by begging from another.<br>
Having undertaken a foul tradition, one is not then<br>
a monk.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc267' href='#sc267' data-uid='dhp267'>SC 267</a>But the one who sets aside both merit and demerit,<br>
who leads a holy life,<br>
Who lives in the world perceptively,<br>
This one is truly is called monk.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc268' href='#sc268' data-uid='dhp268'>SC 268</a>One deluded and ignorant is not a sage by silence.<br>
But one who takes up the best as if holding a scale is<br>
wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc269' href='#sc269' data-uid='dhp269'>SC 269</a>One who avoids evils thereby is a sage.<br>
One who knows both best and worst in the world is<br>
thereby called sage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc270' href='#sc270' data-uid='dhp270'>SC 270</a>One is not a noble by hurting living beings.<br>
One who is gentle to all beings is thereby called<br>
noble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc271' href='#sc271' data-uid='dhp271'>SC 271</a>Neither by precept and virtue, nor by great<br>
learning;<br>
Neither by attaining samādhi, nor inhabiting a<br>
solitary dwelling;</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc272' href='#sc272' data-uid='dhp272'>SC 272</a>Nor by thinking, “I touch the happiness of<br>
renunciation, unknown to the ordinary,” Do you, O monk, find contentment,<br>
If you have not attained the dissolution of the<br>
toxins.</p>
