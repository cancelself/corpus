<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc197' href='#sc197' data-uid='dhp197'>SC 197</a>So very happily we live,<br>
Without hostility among the hostile.<br>
Among the hostile, we dwell peaceably.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc198' href='#sc198' data-uid='dhp198'>SC 198</a>So very happily we live,<br>
Healthy among the ill.<br>
Among the ill, we dwell in health.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc199' href='#sc199' data-uid='dhp199'>SC 199</a>So very happily we live,<br>
Without ambition among the ambitious.<br>
Among the ambitious, we dwell without ambition.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc200' href='#sc200' data-uid='dhp200'>SC 200</a>So very happily we live,<br>
We who possess nothing.<br>
We will feed on delight,<br>
Like the radiant gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc201' href='#sc201' data-uid='dhp201'>SC 201</a>Victory gives birth to enmity.<br>
The defeated lie in suffering.<br>
Having renounced victory and defeat,<br>
The calm one rests at ease.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc202' href='#sc202' data-uid='dhp202'>SC 202</a>There is no fire like passion.<br>
There is no evil like ill will.<br>
There is no suffering like the aggregates.<br>
There is no happiness higher than peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc203' href='#sc203' data-uid='dhp203'>SC 203</a>Hunger is the greatest illness.<br>
Conditioned things are the greatest suffering.<br>
For the one who knows reality as it is,<br>
Nibbāna is the supreme happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc204' href='#sc204' data-uid='dhp204'>SC 204</a>Health is the finest possession.<br>
Contentment is the greatest wealth.<br>
Those trusted are the best relatives.<br>
Nibbāna is the supreme happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc205' href='#sc205' data-uid='dhp205'>SC 205</a>Having drunk the nectar of solitude and tranquility,<br>
One becomes free of evil and fear,<br>
Drinking the nectar of Dhamma delight.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc206' href='#sc206' data-uid='dhp206'>SC 206</a>Seeing the noble ones is good;<br>
Their company is always pleasant.<br>
Free from seeing fools,<br>
One would be happy always.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc207' href='#sc207' data-uid='dhp207'>SC 207</a>By associating with fools one grieves a long time.<br>
Living with fools is like living with an enemy;<br>
always afflictive.<br>
Living with the wise is like a gathering of relatives;<br>
always a joy.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc208' href='#sc208' data-uid='dhp208'>SC 208</a>Therefore:<br>
Follow the good, the intelligent,<br>
One clever, wise, learned, committed in virtue,<br>
well-practicing, and noble,<br>
As the moon follows the path of stars.</p>
