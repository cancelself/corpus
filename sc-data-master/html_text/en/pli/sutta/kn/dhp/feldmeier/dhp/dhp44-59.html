<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc44' href='#sc44' data-uid='dhp44'>SC 44</a>Who will conquer this earth,<br>
The worlds of Yama, and those of the gods?<br>
Who will select a well-taught Dhamma word,<br>
As an expert gardener selects a flower?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc45' href='#sc45' data-uid='dhp45'>SC 45</a>The disciple will conquer this earth,<br>
The worlds of Yama, and those of the gods.<br>
The disciple will select the well-taught Dhamma<br>
word,<br>
As an expert gardener selects a flower.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46' data-uid='dhp46'>SC 46</a>Knowing this body to be like foam,<br>
Realizing its mirage-like nature,<br>
Cutting off the flowers of Māra,<br>
One may go unseen by the King of Death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc47' href='#sc47' data-uid='dhp47'>SC 47</a>The one with a clinging mind,<br>
Who is just gathering flowers,<br>
Is carried away by death,<br>
As a sleeping village is carried away by a great flood.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc48' href='#sc48' data-uid='dhp48'>SC 48</a>The one with a clinging mind,<br>
Who is only gathering flowers,<br>
Is overpowered by death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49' data-uid='dhp49'>SC 49</a>As a bee departing the flower,<br>
Having taken its nectar,<br>
Does no harm to its color or fragrance,<br>
So should a sage go through a village.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc50' href='#sc50' data-uid='dhp50'>SC 50</a>Do not attend to others’ wrong doings,<br>
What they have done or failed to do.<br>
Attend only to yourself,<br>
And what you have done and failed to do.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc51' href='#sc51' data-uid='dhp51'>SC 51</a>Like a beautiful flower<br>
That is full of color but lacking fragrance,<br>
So too are well-said words,<br>
Fruitless when not lived.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc52' href='#sc52' data-uid='dhp52'>SC 52</a>Like a beautiful flower<br>
That is full of color and fragrant,<br>
So too are well-said words,<br>
Fruitful when lived.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc53' href='#sc53' data-uid='dhp53'>SC 53</a>As many garland strands could be made from a heap<br>
of flowers,<br>
So should one born mortal do much good.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc54' href='#sc54' data-uid='dhp54'>SC 54</a>Neither the fragrance of the flower,<br>
Nor that of sandalwood, tagara, or jasmine,<br>
Can go against the wind,<br>
But the fragrance of the good does go against the<br>
wind;<br>
It pervades all directions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc55' href='#sc55' data-uid='dhp55'>SC 55</a>Sandalwood, tagara, jasmine, and lotus,<br>
Among these perfumes the fragrance of virtue is<br>
unbounded.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc56' href='#sc56' data-uid='dhp56'>SC 56</a>Faint is this fragrance of tagara and sandalwood,<br>
But the scent of the virtuous one blows supreme;<br>
It wafts even among the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc57' href='#sc57' data-uid='dhp57'>SC 57</a>Māra does not find the tracks of those<br>
Consummate in virtue,<br>
Who dwell in vigilance,<br>
And are freed by perfect knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc58' href='#sc58' data-uid='dhp58'>SC 58</a>Just as from a rubbish heap on the roadside,<br>
A lotus flower, so pure of smell and pleasing to the<br>
mind, can grow;</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc59' href='#sc59' data-uid='dhp59'>SC 59</a>So in the midst of the rubbish heap of blind,<br>
ordinary people,<br>
A disciple of the Fully Awakened One shines<br>
radiantly with wisdom.</p>
