<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc306' href='#sc306' data-uid='dhp306'>SC 306</a>One who claims what is not so goes to hell;<br>
So also one having done something who says, “I did<br>
not do this.” Both do base deeds, and both are equal after death<br>
in the other world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc307' href='#sc307' data-uid='dhp307'>SC 307</a>Many in saffron robes are unrestrained with evil<br>
character.<br>
By evil deeds these wicked ones are reborn in hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc308' href='#sc308' data-uid='dhp308'>SC 308</a>Better to eat an iron ball, hot like a fire’s point,<br>
Than if one, immoral and unrestrained,<br>
Would eat the country’s alms food.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc309' href='#sc309' data-uid='dhp309'>SC 309</a>The negligent man, who pursues the wife of<br>
another,<br>
Encounters four conditions: accumulation of<br>
demerit,<br>
An unpleasant bed, reproach, and finally hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc310' href='#sc310' data-uid='dhp310'>SC 310</a>So, a man ought not resort to another’s wife,<br>
Accumulating demerit, a bad destination, and the<br>
king’s harsh punishment.<br>
Little is the delight of a fearful man with a fearful<br>
woman.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc311' href='#sc311' data-uid='dhp311'>SC 311</a>Just as wrongly grasped kusa grass cuts the hand,<br>
So the renunciant life, wrongly handled, pulls toward<br>
hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc312' href='#sc312' data-uid='dhp312'>SC 312</a>A lax action, an impure observance,<br>
A dubious holy life:<br>
This is hardly fruitful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc313' href='#sc313' data-uid='dhp313'>SC 313</a>Do what ought to be done,<br>
Undertake it firmly.<br>
The lax religious life simply scatters more dust.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc314' href='#sc314' data-uid='dhp314'>SC 314</a>An evil deed is better not done.<br>
Such a deed torments one later.<br>
A good deed is better done,<br>
Which, when done, does not cause regret.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc315' href='#sc315' data-uid='dhp315'>SC 315</a>Just as a border city is protected inside and out,<br>
So you ought to guard yourself.<br>
Let not a moment escape.<br>
They who let the moment pass grieve<br>
When consigned to hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc316' href='#sc316' data-uid='dhp316'>SC 316</a>Ashamed of what is not shameful,<br>
And not ashamed of what is shameful;<br>
Those undertaking wrong view<br>
Go to a miserable destination.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc317' href='#sc317' data-uid='dhp317'>SC 317</a>Being afraid of what is not frightful,<br>
And being unafraid of the frightful,<br>
Those undertaking wrong view<br>
Go to a miserable destination.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc318' href='#sc318' data-uid='dhp318'>SC 318</a>Imagining fault in the faultless,<br>
And perceiving no fault in the sinful,<br>
Those undertaking wrong view<br>
Go to a miserable existence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc319' href='#sc319' data-uid='dhp319'>SC 319</a>Having known fault as fault<br>
And faultless as faultless,<br>
Those undertaking right view<br>
Go to a favorable destination.</p>
