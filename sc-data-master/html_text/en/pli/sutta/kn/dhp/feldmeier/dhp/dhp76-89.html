<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc76' href='#sc76' data-uid='dhp76'>SC 76</a>One ought to regard another who sees one’s faults,<br>
And censures what should be censured,<br>
As a revealer of treasures.<br>
One should associate with such an intelligent and<br>
wise person,<br>
For such company is always for the better.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc77' href='#sc77' data-uid='dhp77'>SC 77</a>He who would counsel, instruct,<br>
And restrain another from base behavior<br>
Is dear to the good, but displeasing to the bad.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc78' href='#sc78' data-uid='dhp78'>SC 78</a>Do not associate with bad friends.<br>
Do not associate with depraved people.<br>
Associate with virtuous friends.<br>
Associate with the best of people.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc79' href='#sc79' data-uid='dhp79'>SC 79</a>One who drinks in the Dhamma sleeps happily<br>
With a clear mind.<br>
The wise one ever-delights in the Dhamma<br>
Proclaimed by the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc80' href='#sc80' data-uid='dhp80'>SC 80</a>Irrigators guide water,<br>
Fletchers straighten the shaft,<br>
Carpenters bend wood,<br>
The wise master themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc81' href='#sc81' data-uid='dhp81'>SC 81</a>Just as a solid rock is unmoved by the wind,<br>
So the wise are unmoved by blame or praise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc82' href='#sc82' data-uid='dhp82'>SC 82</a>Just as a deep lake is clear and undisturbed,<br>
So the wise become clear,<br>
Having heard the teachings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc83' href='#sc83' data-uid='dhp83'>SC 83</a>The good are not pleasure-lovers who seek idle<br>
chatter;<br>
Always, they are detached.<br>
Though touched by comfort and then by affliction,<br>
The wise manifest no elation or depression.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc84' href='#sc84' data-uid='dhp84'>SC 84</a>One who would not want, for the sake of oneself or<br>
another,<br>
A son, wealth, a kingdom, or unjust success;<br>
This is one who is virtuous, wise, and righteous.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc85' href='#sc85' data-uid='dhp85'>SC 85</a>Few are those who have gone to the other shore;<br>
Many are those who run about on this side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc86' href='#sc86' data-uid='dhp86'>SC 86</a>But those who live according to the well-taught<br>
Dhamma<br>
Will go beyond the realm of death, so difficult to<br>
cross.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc87' href='#sc87' data-uid='dhp87'>SC 87</a>Having abandoned the dark state,<br>
The wise one cultivates the light;<br>
Having gone from home to homelessness,<br>
He enters solitude, so difficult to enjoy.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc88' href='#sc88' data-uid='dhp88'>SC 88</a>Owning nothing, having abandoned sense pleasures,<br>
Having cleansed himself from mental defilements,<br>
There, let the wise one wish for delight.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc89' href='#sc89' data-uid='dhp89'>SC 89</a>Those who have minds well-developed in the means<br>
of awakening,<br>
Who, having removed the toxins, delight in<br>
renouncing attachments:<br>
They are radiant and completely emancipated in<br>
this world.</p>
