<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc157' href='#sc157' data-uid='dhp157'>SC 157</a>If one would know oneself as dear,<br>
One would keep oneself well-protected.<br>
The wise man should guard himself<br>
Throughout the three watches of the night.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc158' href='#sc158' data-uid='dhp158'>SC 158</a>One should first establish oneself in what is proper.<br>
Then only could the wise man instruct others and<br>
remain unstained.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc159' href='#sc159' data-uid='dhp159'>SC 159</a>If one would only do oneself what one instructs<br>
others to do!<br>
Then, well-restrained, he would well-train others.<br>
Truly, training oneself is most difficult.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc160' href='#sc160' data-uid='dhp160'>SC 160</a>Truly oneself is one’s own protector.<br>
What other protector could there be?<br>
Only by being well-trained oneself<br>
Does one obtain the true protector, so hard to gain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc161' href='#sc161' data-uid='dhp161'>SC 161</a>By oneself is evil done;<br>
It proceeds from oneself, it originates from oneself.<br>
It crushes the fool,<br>
Like a diamond crushes a precious stone.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc162' href='#sc162' data-uid='dhp162'>SC 162</a>He who covers himself with depraved conduct,<br>
Like a creeper covers a sala tree,<br>
Does to himself what an enemy desires for him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc163' href='#sc163' data-uid='dhp163'>SC 163</a>It is easy to do wrong,<br>
So harmful to oneself.<br>
It is indeed most difficult to do good,<br>
So beneficial to oneself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc164' href='#sc164' data-uid='dhp164'>SC 164</a>He who scorns the teaching of the arahants,<br>
Those nobles who live the Dhamma,<br>
Is the fool who relies on evil views.<br>
Like the fruit of a bamboo, he ripens to self-<br>
destruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc165' href='#sc165' data-uid='dhp165'>SC 165</a>By oneself alone is evil done, by oneself one<br>
becomes defiled.<br>
Evil is undone by oneself, by oneself alone can one<br>
become cleansed.<br>
Purity and impurity arise from oneself. No one can<br>
purify another.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc166' href='#sc166' data-uid='dhp166'>SC 166</a>Neglect not your own welfare for another’s,<br>
However great.<br>
If you fully understood your own welfare,<br>
You would pursue the true attainment.</p>
