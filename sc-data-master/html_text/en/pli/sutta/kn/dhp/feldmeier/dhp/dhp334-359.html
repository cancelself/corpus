<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc334' href='#sc334' data-uid='dhp334'>SC 334</a>The craving of the careless one grows like a creeper.<br>
The craver jumps from existence to existence,<br>
Like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc335' href='#sc335' data-uid='dhp335'>SC 335</a>One who is conquered by this miserable craving,<br>
This clinging in the world:<br>
His sorrows grow like bīraṇa grass after rain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc336' href='#sc336' data-uid='dhp336'>SC 336</a>But one who conquers this miserable craving,<br>
So difficult to overcome in the world:<br>
His sorrows fall away, like drops of water from a<br>
lotus.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc337' href='#sc337' data-uid='dhp337'>SC 337</a>I say to you: Good fortune to all assembled here!<br>
Uproot the root of craving,<br>
As one would who desires the fragrant root of the<br>
bīraṇa grass.<br>
Let not Māra crush you, as a torrent crushes a reed,<br>
Again and again and again.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc338' href='#sc338' data-uid='dhp338'>SC 338</a>Just as a tree cut down will grow again<br>
When the root remains healthy and strong,<br>
So this suffering arises again and again<br>
When dormant craving is not destroyed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc339' href='#sc339' data-uid='dhp339'>SC 339</a>The wrong-viewed person,<br>
The one in whom the thirty-six streams of craving<br>
flow mightily,<br>
Is carried away by these currents,<br>
These thoughts dependent on passion.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc340' href='#sc340' data-uid='dhp340'>SC 340</a>Streams flow everywhere.<br>
The creeper, having sprung up, establishes itself.<br>
Seeing that the creeper has emerged,<br>
Use wisdom to cut it off at the root.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc341' href='#sc341' data-uid='dhp341'>SC 341</a>Delights, flowing along and filled with lust, arise in<br>
people.<br>
Surely, those intent on enjoyment, seeking pleasure,<br>
Undergo birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc342' href='#sc342' data-uid='dhp342'>SC 342</a>Encircled by craving,<br>
People run around like ensnared hares.<br>
Bound by the fetters of attachment.<br>
They undergo long suffering again and again.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc343' href='#sc343' data-uid='dhp343'>SC 343</a>Encircled by craving,<br>
People run around like ensnared hares.<br>
Therefore, one who desires dispassion<br>
Should dispel craving.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc344' href='#sc344' data-uid='dhp344'>SC 344</a>Who, for the sake of being free from the forest (of<br>
craving), Is resolved upon the forest (of solitude), And then runs back to the forest (of craving); Come and see one freed who runs back into<br>
bondage!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc345' href='#sc345' data-uid='dhp345'>SC 345</a>The fetter made of iron, of wood, or of babbaja grass,<br>
Is not so strong, say the wise.<br>
But infatuation with jewels and ornaments,<br>
Or longing for sons and wives,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc346' href='#sc346' data-uid='dhp346'>SC 346</a>That is a strong bond, say the wise,<br>
Loose, yet difficult to be freed from.<br>
When the bond is cut, they go about,<br>
Free from longing,<br>
Having abandoned sensual pleasure.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc347' href='#sc347' data-uid='dhp347'>SC 347</a>Those excited by passion fall into the current,<br>
As a spider caught in its self-made web.<br>
Having cut off this passion, the wise set forth,<br>
Free from longing,<br>
Having abandoned all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc348' href='#sc348' data-uid='dhp348'>SC 348</a>Let go of the past, let go of the future, let go of the<br>
present.<br>
Gone to the other shore of existence,<br>
With mind everywhere emancipated,<br>
You will not again come to birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc349' href='#sc349' data-uid='dhp349'>SC 349</a>For the one with disturbed thoughts and intense<br>
passion,<br>
Who is focused on pleasant things,<br>
Craving only grows stronger.<br>
Indeed, craving fortifies the fetter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc350' href='#sc350' data-uid='dhp350'>SC 350</a>For the one devoted to calming thoughts, always<br>
mindful,<br>
Who meditates on what is foul:<br>
That one will make an end and cut off Māra’s bond.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc351' href='#sc351' data-uid='dhp351'>SC 351</a>One who has attained perfection,<br>
Who is pure, without craving or fear:<br>
This one has destroyed the arrows of becoming;<br>
His present body, the last.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc352' href='#sc352' data-uid='dhp352'>SC 352</a>One who is without craving, free of grasping,<br>
Skilled in the scriptures, who would know their<br>
arrangement;<br>
Such a one is truly called great person;<br>
Such a one possesses great wisdom;<br>
Such a one is living his final life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc353' href='#sc353' data-uid='dhp353'>SC 353</a>I know all; I overcome all.<br>
Free of stain in all conditions,<br>
Abandoning everything,<br>
Emancipated by the dissolution of craving,<br>
I have understood everything on my own.</p>
To whom should I point (as teacher)?
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc354' href='#sc354' data-uid='dhp354'>SC 354</a>The gift of Dhamma overwhelms all gifts.<br>
The taste of Dhamma overwhelms all tastes.<br>
The delight of Dhamma overwhelms all delights.<br>
The dissolution of craving overwhelms all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc355' href='#sc355' data-uid='dhp355'>SC 355</a>Wealth wounds those lacking wisdom,<br>
Not those seeking the other shore.<br>
Craving wealth, those who lack wisdom<br>
Destroy others, even as themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc356' href='#sc356' data-uid='dhp356'>SC 356</a>Fields are ruined by weeds;<br>
Humanity is ruined by passions.<br>
But indeed what is given to those whose passions are<br>
gone<br>
Bears great fruit.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc357' href='#sc357' data-uid='dhp357'>SC 357</a>Fields are ruined by weeds;<br>
Humanity is ruined by ill will.<br>
But indeed what is given to those whose ill will is<br>
gone<br>
Bears great fruit.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc358' href='#sc358' data-uid='dhp358'>SC 358</a>Fields are ruined by weeds;<br>
Humanity is ruined by delusion.<br>
But indeed what is given to those whose delusion is<br>
gone<br>
Bears great fruit.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc359' href='#sc359' data-uid='dhp359'>SC 359</a>Fields are ruined by weeds;<br>
Humanity is ruined by longing.<br>
Truly, what is given to those whose longing is gone<br>
Bears great fruit.</p>
