<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc383' href='#sc383' data-uid='dhp383'>SC 383</a>Strive, cut off the stream, O brahmin,<br>
And drive out sensual craving.<br>
Knowing the dissolution of conditioned things,<br>
You, O brahmin, are a knower of the Uncreated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc384' href='#sc384' data-uid='dhp384'>SC 384</a>When the brahmin has gone to the other shore<br>
By the twofold practice (of serenity and insight), Then that sage’s every fetter falls away.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc385' href='#sc385' data-uid='dhp385'>SC 385</a>The one who is untroubled and beyond fear,<br>
For whom there exists neither this nor the other<br>
shore,<br>
Nor both this and the other shore:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc386' href='#sc386' data-uid='dhp386'>SC 386</a>The pure one who sits absorbed in meditation,<br>
Who has done what ought to be done,<br>
Who is without toxins, having obtained the highest<br>
attainment:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc387' href='#sc387' data-uid='dhp387'>SC 387</a>The sun shines by day, the moon by night;<br>
In armor shines the warrior, in meditation the<br>
brahmin.<br>
But all day and night the Buddha shines in splendor.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc388' href='#sc388' data-uid='dhp388'>SC 388</a>One who has warded off evil is a brahmin.<br>
One who lives in tranquility is a renunciant.<br>
One who has driven out one’s own impurities<br>
Is called gone forth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc389' href='#sc389' data-uid='dhp389'>SC 389</a>Strike not a brahmin,<br>
Nor should a brahmin give way to anger.<br>
Shame on those who would strike a brahmin,<br>
And greater shame on the brahmin who gives way<br>
to anger.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc390' href='#sc390' data-uid='dhp390'>SC 390</a>For the brahmin, there is nothing better<br>
Than restraining his mind from what it cherishes.<br>
Whenever he turns away from the desire to harm,<br>
He thereby appeases suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc391' href='#sc391' data-uid='dhp391'>SC 391</a>The one who does no wrong in body, speech, and<br>
mind,<br>
Who is restrained in these three ways:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc392' href='#sc392' data-uid='dhp392'>SC 392</a>You should venerate your teacher by whom<br>
You learned the true Dhamma,<br>
Taught by the Perfectly Awakened One,<br>
Like a brahmin venerates the sacrificial fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc393' href='#sc393' data-uid='dhp393'>SC 393</a>Neither by matted hair, nor ancestry, nor birth is<br>
one a brahmin.<br>
The brahmin is the one with whom there is the<br>
truth, purity, and the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc394' href='#sc394' data-uid='dhp394'>SC 394</a>What of your matted hair, O fool?<br>
What of your deerskin clothes?<br>
You are a tangled thicket within,<br>
Yet you groom the exterior!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc395' href='#sc395' data-uid='dhp395'>SC 395</a>The one wearing rags from a dust heap,<br>
Emaciated, with veins exposed,<br>
Alone in the forest, absorbed in meditation:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc396' href='#sc396' data-uid='dhp396'>SC 396</a>I do not proclaim a brahmin<br>
Simply by being born of the womb, sprung from a<br>
mother.<br>
If he possesses something he is only called self-<br>
important.<br>
The one who has nothing, who is free from clinging:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc397' href='#sc397' data-uid='dhp397'>SC 397</a>The one who has overcome clinging and cut off<br>
every fetter,<br>
Who has overcome clinging and trembles not;<br>
One unbound:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc398' href='#sc398' data-uid='dhp398'>SC 398</a>The one awakened,<br>
Having cut off strap and thong,<br>
The cord together with the bridle,<br>
Having lifted the crossbar:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc399' href='#sc399' data-uid='dhp399'>SC 399</a>The one who endures insult, binding and beating<br>
without anger,<br>
Whose strength is forbearance, an army’s strength:<br>
That one I proclaim a brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc400' href='#sc400' data-uid='dhp400'>SC 400</a>The one who is free of anger, who observes the<br>
practice,<br>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc401' href='#sc401' data-uid='dhp401'>SC 401</a>The one who is unsmeared by sensual craving,<br>
Like water on a lotus leaf,<br>
The one who is like a mustard seed on the point of an<br>

knowledge,<br>

householders or monks,<br>

Toward both the trembling and the firm,<br>
Who does not kill or cause another to kill:<br>

Conceit, and hypocrisy all fall away,<br>
The one who is like a mustard seed on the point of an<br>
awl:<br>
