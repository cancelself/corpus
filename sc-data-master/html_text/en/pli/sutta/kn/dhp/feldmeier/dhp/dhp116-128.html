<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc116' href='#sc116' data-uid='dhp116'>SC 116</a>Hasten to do good;<br>
Restrain your thoughts from evil.<br>
When the mind is slow in doing good<br>
It delights in evil.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc117' href='#sc117' data-uid='dhp117'>SC 117</a>Should one do evil,<br>
He should not do it again and again.<br>
He ought not to desire this.<br>
Accumulated evil brings great suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc118' href='#sc118' data-uid='dhp118'>SC 118</a>Should one do good,<br>
He should do it again and again.<br>
He ought to desire this.<br>
Accumulated good brings great happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc119' href='#sc119' data-uid='dhp119'>SC 119</a>An evil person sees benefit<br>
As long as the evil has not ripened.<br>
When the evil does ripen,<br>
He realizes misfortune.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc120' href='#sc120' data-uid='dhp120'>SC 120</a>Even a good person sees detriment<br>
Before the goodness has ripened.<br>
When the good does ripen,<br>
He realizes benefit.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc121' href='#sc121' data-uid='dhp121'>SC 121</a>Do not disregard evil, thinking, “It will not come to<br>
me.” Even as falling drops of water can fill a jug,<br>
So the fool becomes full of evil,<br>
Collecting it little by little.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc122' href='#sc122' data-uid='dhp122'>SC 122</a>Do not disregard good, thinking, “It will not come<br>
to me.” Even as falling drops of water can fill a jug,<br>
So the wise one becomes full of goodness,<br>
Collecting it little by little.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc123' href='#sc123' data-uid='dhp123'>SC 123</a>One should avoid evil deeds,<br>
As a merchant with great wealth in a small caravan<br>
Avoids the dangerous road,<br>
As one who desires life avoids poison.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc124' href='#sc124' data-uid='dhp124'>SC 124</a>Without a wound, the hand can carry poison.<br>
With no wound, the poison has no effect.<br>
So evil has no effect for those who do not practice it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc125' href='#sc125' data-uid='dhp125'>SC 125</a>As fine dust thrown against the wind,<br>
So does evil return to the fool<br>
Who wrongs the innocent, the faithful, and the pure.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc126' href='#sc126' data-uid='dhp126'>SC 126</a>Some arise in the womb;<br>
Evildoers arise in hell;<br>
The righteous emerge in heaven;<br>
And those without toxins enter final-Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc127' href='#sc127' data-uid='dhp127'>SC 127</a>There is no place in the world—<br>
Neither in the sky, nor the ocean depth,<br>
Nor inside a mountain cave—<br>
Where one would be free from one’s evil deed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc128' href='#sc128' data-uid='dhp128'>SC 128</a>There is no place in the world—<br>
Neither in the sky, nor the ocean depth,<br>
Nor inside a mountain cave—<br>
Where death is not victorious.</p>
