<h1>The Chapter about Flowers</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc44' href='#sc44' data-uid='dhp44'>SC 44</a>Who will know this earth<br>
and the lower realm, together with the gods?<br>
Who <span class='add'>will reflect</span> on the well-taught verse of Dhamma<br>
as a good man reflects on a flower?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc45' href='#sc45' data-uid='dhp45'>SC 45</a>The trainee will know this earth<br>
and the lower realm, together with the gods.<br>
The trainee <span class='add'>will reflect</span> on the well-taught verse of Dhamma<br>
as a good man reflects on a flower.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46' data-uid='dhp46'>SC 46</a>Knowing that this body is just like froth,<br>
understanding it has the nature of a mirage,<br>
cutting off Māra’s flower-tipped <span class='add'>arrows</span>,<br>
one should go beyond the King of Death’s sight.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc47' href='#sc47' data-uid='dhp47'>SC 47</a>Death takes up and carries away the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,<br>
like a great flood <span class='add'>carries off</span> a sleeping village.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc48' href='#sc48' data-uid='dhp48'>SC 48</a>The End-Maker takes control of the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,<br>
even though he is unsated with sense pleasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49' data-uid='dhp49'>SC 49</a>Just as a bee, without hurting the flower, its colour or scent,<br>
gathers its nectar and escapes, so should the seer roam in the village.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc50' href='#sc50' data-uid='dhp50'>SC 50</a>Not the wrongs of others, or what others have done or have not done<br>
one should consider, but what has been done and not done by oneself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc51' href='#sc51' data-uid='dhp51'>SC 51</a>Just like a beautiful flower, which has colour, but lacks fragrance,<br>
so are well-spoken words fruitless for the one who acts not <span class='add'>on them</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc52' href='#sc52' data-uid='dhp52'>SC 52</a>Just like a beautiful flower, which has colour, and has fragrance,<br>
so are well-spoken words fruitful for the one who does act <span class='add'>on them</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc53' href='#sc53' data-uid='dhp53'>SC 53</a>Just as from a heap of flowers one might make a lot of garlands,<br>
so should many good deeds be done by one who is born a mortal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc54' href='#sc54' data-uid='dhp54'>SC 54</a>The fragrance of flowers goes not against the wind,<br>
nor does sandalwood or pinwheel or white jasmine,<br>
but the fragrance of the good goes against the wind,<br>
the true person’s <span class='add'>fragrance</span> permeates all directions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc55' href='#sc55' data-uid='dhp55'>SC 55</a>Sandalwood, pinwheel, then water lily and striped jasmine,<br>
amongst these kinds of fragrance virtue’s fragrance is unsurpassed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc56' href='#sc56' data-uid='dhp56'>SC 56</a>Pinwheel and sandalwood fragrance are insignificant,<br>
but the fragrance of one who has virtue flutters supreme amongst the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc57' href='#sc57' data-uid='dhp57'>SC 57</a>Māra cannot find the path of those endowed with virtue, who live heedfully,<br>
and who are freed through complete and deep knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc58' href='#sc58' data-uid='dhp58'>SC 58</a>Just as in a forsaken and discarded heap along the highway<br>
a lotus might arise in that place, with a pure fragrance, delighting the mind,<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc59' href='#sc59' data-uid='dhp59'>SC 59</a>so amongst the forsaken, the Perfect Sambuddha’s disciple<br>
outshines the blind and ordinary folk through his wisdom.</p>
