<h1>The Chapter about Old Age</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc146' href='#sc146' data-uid='dhp146'>SC 146</a>Why this laughter, why this joy, when the world is constantly burning,<br>
why, when enveloped by darkness, do you not seek for a light?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc147' href='#sc147' data-uid='dhp147'>SC 147</a>See this beautified manikin, a heap of sores that is raised up,<br>
sick, imagined in many ways, which has nothing stable or firm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc148' href='#sc148' data-uid='dhp148'>SC 148</a>This body is worn out, a nest of disease, perishing,<br>
the putrid body comes to destruction, for life ends in death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc149' href='#sc149' data-uid='dhp149'>SC 149</a>Like discarded white gourds thrown away in autumn<br>
are these grey bones; seeing them, why is there delight?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc150' href='#sc150' data-uid='dhp150'>SC 150</a>This fortress is made out of bones,<br>
plastered over with flesh and blood,<br>
but hidden within lie old age,<br>
death, also conceit and anger.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc151' href='#sc151' data-uid='dhp151'>SC 151</a>Decorated royal chariots decay,<br>
and the body also decays,<br>
but the good Dhamma does not decay,<br>
the good surely pass it on to the good.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc152' href='#sc152' data-uid='dhp152'>SC 152</a>The person of little learning increases in age like an ox,<br>
<span class='add'>for although</span> his flesh does increase, his wisdom does not increase.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc153' href='#sc153' data-uid='dhp153'>SC 153</a>Through the round of countless births and deaths I have wandered without finding<br>
the housebuilder I was seeking: born and suffering once again.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc154' href='#sc154' data-uid='dhp154'>SC 154</a>O housebuilder, now you are seen! You will not build the house again:<br>
all your rafters have been broken, and the ridgepole has been destroyed,<br>
my mind has reached the unconditioned, and craving’s end has been achieved.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc155' href='#sc155' data-uid='dhp155'>SC 155</a>Not having lived the holy life, not having gained wealth in their youth,<br>
they waste away like herons in a small lake devoid of fish.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc156' href='#sc156' data-uid='dhp156'>SC 156</a>Not having lived the holy life, not having gained wealth in their youth,<br>
they lie like <span class='add'>shafts</span> shot from a bow, wailing about things in the past.</p>
