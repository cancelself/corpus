<h1>The Chapter about Anger</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc221' href='#sc221' data-uid='dhp221'>SC 221</a>One should abandon anger, one should abandon conceit,<br>
one should overcome every fetter,<br>
without clinging to mind and bodily form,<br>
sufferings never do befall the one having no possessions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc222' href='#sc222' data-uid='dhp222'>SC 222</a>Whoever should hold back arisen anger just like a swerving chariot,<br>
that one I say is a charioteer, other people are just rein-holders.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc223' href='#sc223' data-uid='dhp223'>SC 223</a>Through kindness one should overcome anger, through goodness one should overcome a lack of goodness,<br>
through gifts one should overcome stinginess, through truth <span class='add'>one should overcome</span> lying speech.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc224' href='#sc224' data-uid='dhp224'>SC 224</a>One should speak out the truth, one should not get angry, when requested give, if only a little,<br>
through these three conditions one can go to the presence of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc225' href='#sc225' data-uid='dhp225'>SC 225</a>Those sages without violence, constantly restrained in body,<br>
go to the deathless <span class='add'>Nibbāna</span>, having gone there they do not grieve.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc226' href='#sc226' data-uid='dhp226'>SC 226</a>For those who are always wakeful, who train both by day and by night,<br>
who are intent on Nibbāna, the pollutants are laid to rest.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc227' href='#sc227' data-uid='dhp227'>SC 227</a>This is something of old, Atula, this is not something of today:<br>
they blame the one who sits silently, they blame the one who talks a lot,<br>
they blame the one who talks in moderation, there is no one in the world not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc228' href='#sc228' data-uid='dhp228'>SC 228</a>There was not and there will not be, and at present there is not found<br>
a person totally blameworthy, or one totally praiseworthy.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc229' href='#sc229' data-uid='dhp229'>SC 229</a>The one who, after being examined day by day, is praised by the wise,<br>
faultless in conduct, sagacious, attending to virtue and wisdom,<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc230' href='#sc230' data-uid='dhp230'>SC 230</a>one who is like a golden coin, who is there worthy to blame him?<br>
That one is praised by the gods, and has been praised by the Brahmās too.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc231' href='#sc231' data-uid='dhp231'>SC 231</a>One should guard against bodily anger, one should be restrained bodily,<br>
abandoning wrong bodily conduct, one should have good bodily conduct.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc232' href='#sc232' data-uid='dhp232'>SC 232</a>One should guard against verbal anger, one should be restrained verbally,<br>
abandoning wrong verbal conduct, one should have good verbal conduct.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc233' href='#sc233' data-uid='dhp233'>SC 233</a>One should guard against mental anger, one should be restrained mentally,<br>
abandoning wrong mental conduct, one should have good mental conduct.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc234' href='#sc234' data-uid='dhp234'>SC 234</a>The wise are restrained bodily, then they are restrained verbally,<br>
the wise are restrained mentally, they are indeed very well-restrained.</p>
