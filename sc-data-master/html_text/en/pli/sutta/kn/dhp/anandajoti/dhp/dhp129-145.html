<h1>The Chapter about the Stick</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc129' href='#sc129' data-uid='dhp129'>SC 129</a>Everyone trembles at the stick, everyone is in fear of death,<br>
comparing oneself <span class='add'>with others</span>, one should not hurt or have <span class='add'>them</span> hurt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc130' href='#sc130' data-uid='dhp130'>SC 130</a>Everyone trembles at the stick, for all of them life is dear,<br>
comparing oneself <span class='add'>with others</span>, one should not hurt or have <span class='add'>them</span> hurt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc131' href='#sc131' data-uid='dhp131'>SC 131</a>One who harms with a stick beings who desire happiness,<br>
while seeking happiness for himself, won’t find happiness after death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc132' href='#sc132' data-uid='dhp132'>SC 132</a>One who harms not with a stick beings who desire happiness,<br>
while seeking happiness for himself, will find happiness after death.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc133' href='#sc133' data-uid='dhp133'>SC 133</a>Do not say anything harsh, spoken to they might answer back to you,<br>
for arrogant talk entails misery, and they might strike you back with a stick.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc134' href='#sc134' data-uid='dhp134'>SC 134</a>If you make no sound like a gong that is broken,<br>
you are <span class='add'>like</span> one who has attained Nibbāna, contention is not found in you.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc135' href='#sc135' data-uid='dhp135'>SC 135</a>Like a cowherd with a stick drives cattle to pasture,<br>
so do old age and death drive life out of beings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc136' href='#sc136' data-uid='dhp136'>SC 136</a>The fool does not understand the wicked deeds he is doing,<br>
the stupid one is consumed by his deeds as <span class='add'>by</span> a burning fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc137' href='#sc137' data-uid='dhp137'>SC 137</a>Whoever offends with a stick those who are inoffensive and harmless<br>
will quickly fall into one of ten states:<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc138' href='#sc138' data-uid='dhp138'>SC 138</a>harsh feelings, loss <span class='add'>of his wealth</span>, and the break up of the body,<br>
or even heavy affliction, or surely he will lose his mind,<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc139' href='#sc139' data-uid='dhp139'>SC 139</a><span class='add'>there may be</span> danger from the King, or slander that is terrible,<br>
<span class='add'>he may suffer from</span> loss of kin, or <span class='add'>from</span> the destruction of wealth,<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc140' href='#sc140' data-uid='dhp140'>SC 140</a>also his houses may be consumed by flames and fire,<br>
and at the break-up of the body that one lacking in wisdom will arise in the underworld.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc141' href='#sc141' data-uid='dhp141'>SC 141</a>Not going naked, nor matted hair, nor mud,<br>
nor fasting or lying on stony ground,<br>
dust and dirt, <span class='add'>or</span> striving while squatting,<br>
can purify a mortal who has not removed uncertainty.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc142' href='#sc142' data-uid='dhp142'>SC 142</a>Even if he were to adorn himself,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> is peaceful, trained, settled, spiritual,<br>
and has put aside the stick towards all beings,<br>
he is a brahmin, an ascetic, a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc143' href='#sc143' data-uid='dhp143'>SC 143</a>Whatever person in the world is found restrained by conscience,<br>
and is aware of his fault, is like a good horse that is <span class='add'>restrained</span> by a whip.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc144' href='#sc144' data-uid='dhp144'>SC 144</a>Like a good horse restrained by the whip,<br>
you should be ardent and spiritually intense.<br>
Having faith, virtue and energy,<br>
concentration and investigation of the Dhamma.<br>
One who has understanding and good conduct, mindfulness,<br>
will abandon this not insignificant suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc145' href='#sc145' data-uid='dhp145'>SC 145</a>Course-makers lead water,<br>
fletchers straighten arrows,<br>
carpenters straighten wood,<br>
the mild master themselves.</p>
