<h1>The Chapter about the Buddha</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc179' href='#sc179' data-uid='dhp179'>SC 179</a>He whose victory cannot be undone,<br>
whose victory no one here approaches,<br>
the Buddha, whose range is endless,<br>
by what path can you lead the pathless one?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc180' href='#sc180' data-uid='dhp180'>SC 180</a>For him there is no desire, attachment,<br>
or craving to lead <span class='add'>him</span> anywhere,<br>
the Buddha, whose range is endless,<br>
by what path can you lead the pathless one?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc181' href='#sc181' data-uid='dhp181'>SC 181</a>Those wise ones intent on meditation, who delight in the peace of renunciation,<br>
even the gods are envious of them, the Sambuddhas, the ones who are mindful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc182' href='#sc182' data-uid='dhp182'>SC 182</a>It is rare to acquire <span class='add'>birth as a</span> human, rare is the life of mortals,<br>
it is rare to hear the True Dhamma, rare the arising of Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc183' href='#sc183' data-uid='dhp183'>SC 183</a>The non-doing of anything wicked, undertaking of what is good,<br>
the purification of one’s mind - this is the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc184' href='#sc184' data-uid='dhp184'>SC 184</a>Enduring patience is the supreme austerity,<br>
Nibbāna is supreme say the Buddhas,<br>
for one gone forth does not hurt another,<br>
<span class='add'>nor does</span> an ascetic harass another.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc185' href='#sc185' data-uid='dhp185'>SC 185</a>Not finding fault, not hurting, restraint by the regulations,<br>
knowing the right measure of food, <span class='add'>living in</span> a remote dwelling,<br>
devotion to meditation - this is the teaching of the Buddhas.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc186' href='#sc186' data-uid='dhp186'>SC 186</a>Not through a rain of coins is satisfaction found for sense desires,<br>
the wise one knowing: “Sense pleasures have little joy, <span class='add'>much</span> suffering,”<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc187' href='#sc187' data-uid='dhp187'>SC 187</a>does not find delight even in heavenly pleasures.<br>
The disciple of the Perfect Sambuddha delights in craving’s destruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc188' href='#sc188' data-uid='dhp188'>SC 188</a>Many people shaken by fear go for refuge<br>
to woods and mountains, to tree shrines in pleasure parks.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc189' href='#sc189' data-uid='dhp189'>SC 189</a>That is not a secure refuge, that is not the refuge supreme,<br>
that is not the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc190' href='#sc190' data-uid='dhp190'>SC 190</a>Whoever has gone refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha,<br>
and who sees with right wisdom the four noble truths:<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc191' href='#sc191' data-uid='dhp191'>SC 191</a>Suffering, arising of suffering, and the overcoming of suffering,<br>
the eightfold noble path leading to the stilling of suffering.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc192' href='#sc192' data-uid='dhp192'>SC 192</a>That is a secure refuge, that is the refuge supreme,<br>
that is the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc193' href='#sc193' data-uid='dhp193'>SC 193</a>A person of good breed is rare, that one is not born everywhere,<br>
wherever that wise one is born, that family gains happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc194' href='#sc194' data-uid='dhp194'>SC 194</a>The arising of the Buddhas is good, the teaching of the True Dhamma is good,<br>
the harmony of the Saṅgha is good, devotion to harmony is good.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc195' href='#sc195' data-uid='dhp195'>SC 195</a>For those who worship those worthy of worship, whether Buddhas or disciples,<br>
who have overcome the impediments, crossed over grief and lamentation;<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc196' href='#sc196' data-uid='dhp196'>SC 196</a>for those who worship such as these, the emancipated, the fearless,<br>
no one is able to measure their <span class='add'>vast</span> merit, <span class='add'>saying:</span> it is as much as this.</p>
