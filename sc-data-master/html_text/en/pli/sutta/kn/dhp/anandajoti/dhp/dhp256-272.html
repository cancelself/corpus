<h1>The Chapter about one who stands by Dhamma</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc256' href='#sc256' data-uid='dhp256'>SC 256</a>One who would hastily settle a case because of that is not one who stands by Dhamma,<br>
the wise one should discriminate the two: what is the case and what is not the case.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc257' href='#sc257' data-uid='dhp257'>SC 257</a>The one who settles for other people without haste, justly and impartially,<br>
the sagacious one, protecting Dhamma, is said to be one who stands by Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc258' href='#sc258' data-uid='dhp258'>SC 258</a>One is not a wise person merely because of speaking much;<br>
being safe, hatred-free, fearless, one is called a wise person.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc259' href='#sc259' data-uid='dhp259'>SC 259</a>One is not a Dhamma-bearer merely through speaking much,<br>
but the one who, having heard a little, sees Dhamma for himself,<br>
is one who bears Dhamma, the one who is not heedless regarding Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc260' href='#sc260' data-uid='dhp260'>SC 260</a>One is not an elder because one’s head has grey hair,<br>
for the one who is <span class='add'>only</span> well-matured, aged, is said to be old in vain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc261' href='#sc261' data-uid='dhp261'>SC 261</a>In whom is truth, Dhamma, non-violence, restraint and <span class='add'>good</span> training,<br>
the wise one who throws out the stain is <span class='add'>truly</span> called an elder.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc262' href='#sc262' data-uid='dhp262'>SC 262</a>Not by eloquence only, or by a beautiful complexion,<br>
is a person honourable, <span class='add'>if still</span> jealous, selfish and deceitful;<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc263' href='#sc263' data-uid='dhp263'>SC 263</a>for the one in whom this is cut off, destroyed at the root, dug up,<br>
that sage who has thrown out hatred is said to be honourable.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc264' href='#sc264' data-uid='dhp264'>SC 264</a>Not through a shaven head is one an ascetic, <span class='add'>if</span> one lacks vows, speaks lies,<br>
and is endowed with greed and desire, how will one be an ascetic?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc265' href='#sc265' data-uid='dhp265'>SC 265</a>The one who pacifies wicked deeds, small and great, in every way –<br>
through the pacifing of wicked deeds he is said to be an ascetic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc266' href='#sc266' data-uid='dhp266'>SC 266</a>One is not a monastic merely through eating others’ almsfood,<br>
the one who undertakes a false Dhamma to that extent is not a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc267' href='#sc267' data-uid='dhp267'>SC 267</a>If he is one who lives the holy life here, warding off both merit and demerit,<br>
and wanders with discrimination in the world, that one is said to be a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc268' href='#sc268' data-uid='dhp268'>SC 268</a>Not through silence is a deluded fool <span class='add'>considered to be</span> a seer,<br>
the wise one, like one holding the balance, takes up what is noble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc269' href='#sc269' data-uid='dhp269'>SC 269</a>The seer who rejects wicked deeds through that is <span class='add'>considered</span> a seer,<br>
whoever understands both worlds because of that is said to be a seer.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc270' href='#sc270' data-uid='dhp270'>SC 270</a>Not through hurting breathing beings one is noble,<br>
the one who does not hurt any breathing beings is said to be noble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc271' href='#sc271' data-uid='dhp271'>SC 271</a>Not merely through virtue or vows, or through great learning,<br>
or through the attainment of concentration, or through a secluded dwelling,<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc272' href='#sc272' data-uid='dhp272'>SC 272</a>do I attain the happiness of renunciation, not practised by worldly people;<br>
let a monastic not be confident <span class='add'>as long as</span> the destruction of the pollutants is unattained.</p>
