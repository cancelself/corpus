<h1>The Chapter about the Thousands</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc100' href='#sc100' data-uid='dhp100'>SC 100</a>Though there are a thousand sayings consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one useful word hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc101' href='#sc101' data-uid='dhp101'>SC 101</a>Though there are a thousand verses consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one word of a verse hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc102' href='#sc102' data-uid='dhp102'>SC 102</a>One may speak a thousand verses consisting of useless words,<br>
better is one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one is brought to peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc103' href='#sc103' data-uid='dhp103'>SC 103</a>One may conquer a thousand men a thousand times in a battle,<br>
but having conquered one’s own self, one would surely be supreme in battle.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc104' href='#sc104' data-uid='dhp104'>SC 104</a>Conquest over self is better than that over other people,<br>
for the person who conquers himself, who lives constantly well-restrained,<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc105' href='#sc105' data-uid='dhp105'>SC 105</a>neither gods, nor gandhabbas, nor Māra together with Brahmās,<br>
can turn conquest into defeat for a person who is like this.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc106' href='#sc106' data-uid='dhp106'>SC 106</a>One might give alms impartially with a thousand <span class='add'>coins of money</span> month by month for a hundred <span class='add'>years</span>;<br>
and one might worship someone with developed self for a second –<br>
that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc107' href='#sc107' data-uid='dhp107'>SC 107</a>One person might care for the fire in the woods for a hundred years;<br>
and one might worship someone with developed self for a second –<br>
that worship is surely better than the hundred-year sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc108' href='#sc108' data-uid='dhp108'>SC 108</a>Whatever the alms or the sacrifice in the world<br>
the one seeking merit may give for a year,<br>
all that comes not to a quarter <span class='add'>of the merit</span> –<br>
better is the worship of the upright.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc109' href='#sc109' data-uid='dhp109'>SC 109</a>For the one who is constantly worshipping honourable elders,<br>
four things increase: the length of life, beauty, happiness, and strength.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc110' href='#sc110' data-uid='dhp110'>SC 110</a>One might live for a hundred years, unvirtuous and uncomposed,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better, for one with virtue and meditation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc111' href='#sc111' data-uid='dhp111'>SC 111</a>One might live for a hundred years, lacking in wisdom, uncomposed,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better, for one endowed with wisdom and meditation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc112' href='#sc112' data-uid='dhp112'>SC 112</a>One might live for a hundred years, indolent, with less energy,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better, for one with energy set up and firm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc113' href='#sc113' data-uid='dhp113'>SC 113</a>One might live for a hundred years without seeing rise and fall,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better <span class='add'>for the one</span> seeing rise and fall.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc114' href='#sc114' data-uid='dhp114'>SC 114</a>One might live for a hundred years without seeing the deathless state,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better <span class='add'>for one</span> seeing the deathless state.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc115' href='#sc115' data-uid='dhp115'>SC 115</a>One might live for a hundred years without seeing the supreme state,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> a life of one day is better <span class='add'>for one</span> seeing the supreme state.</p>
