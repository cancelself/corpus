<h1>The Chapter about the Wise</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc76' href='#sc76' data-uid='dhp76'>SC 76</a>One should regard someone who shows your faults just like one who points out hidden treasure,<br>
one should keep company with such a sagacious, learned person who reproves you;<br>
keeping company with such is <span class='add'>surely</span> better for you, not worse.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc77' href='#sc77' data-uid='dhp77'>SC 77</a>One should advise and instruct, and forbid whatever is vile,<br>
for he is dear to the good, <span class='add'>but</span> he is not dear to the bad.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc78' href='#sc78' data-uid='dhp78'>SC 78</a>One should not keep company with wicked friends, one should not keep company with the ignoble,<br>
you should keep company with spiritual friends, you should keep company with superior people.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc79' href='#sc79' data-uid='dhp79'>SC 79</a>The one who drinks Dhamma lives well, with a clear mind,<br>
the wise one will always delight in the Dhamma that is made known by the Noble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc80' href='#sc80' data-uid='dhp80'>SC 80</a>Course-makers lead water,<br>
fletchers straighten arrows,<br>
carpenters straighten wood,<br>
the wise master themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc81' href='#sc81' data-uid='dhp81'>SC 81</a>Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind,<br>
so the wise are not moved by blame or praise.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc82' href='#sc82' data-uid='dhp82'>SC 82</a>Like a lake that is deep, clear and unruffled,<br>
just so the wise are confident after listening to Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc83' href='#sc83' data-uid='dhp83'>SC 83</a>True people surely everywhere renounce,<br>
the good do not talk of desiring sense-pleasures;<br>
when touched by pleasure or by suffering,<br>
the wise show neither elation or depression.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc84' href='#sc84' data-uid='dhp84'>SC 84</a>Not for one’s own sake and not for another’s sake,<br>
not desiring a child, riches, or a kingdom –<br>
he should not desire his success through corruption;<br>
he should be both virtuous and wise and righteous.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc85' href='#sc85' data-uid='dhp85'>SC 85</a>Amongst humans few people go beyond,<br>
the rest of the people run down the bank,<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc86' href='#sc86' data-uid='dhp86'>SC 86</a>but those who live righteously, conforming with this well-taught Dhamma,<br>
those folk will go beyond the realm of death, which is very hard to cross.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc87' href='#sc87' data-uid='dhp87'>SC 87</a>Having abandoned the dark state, the wise one should develop the bright,<br>
having gone forth to homelessness from home; in solitude, where it is hard to delight.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc88' href='#sc88' data-uid='dhp88'>SC 88</a>One should desire to delight in that place, having given up sense pleasures, and having no possessions,<br>
the wise one should purify the self of defilements of mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc89' href='#sc89' data-uid='dhp89'>SC 89</a>For those who have well developed with right mind the factors of complete awakening,<br>
having given up grasping, those who delight in being unattached,<br>
pollutant-free, shining forth, are emancipated in the world.</p>
