<h1>The Chapter about Monastics</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc360' href='#sc360' data-uid='dhp360'>SC 360</a>Restraint of eye is good, restraint of ear is good,<br>
restraint of nose is good, restraint of tongue is good,<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc361' href='#sc361' data-uid='dhp361'>SC 361</a>restraint of body is good, restraint of speech is good,<br>
restraint of mind is good, restraint is everywhere good,<br>
a monastic who is restrained everywhere is liberated from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc362' href='#sc362' data-uid='dhp362'>SC 362</a>One who controls his hands, controls his feet,<br>
controls his speech, controls the <span class='add'>mind</span> supreme,<br>
with inner delight and composure,<br>
solitary, content: that one is called a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc363' href='#sc363' data-uid='dhp363'>SC 363</a>That monastic who restrains the mouth, who speaks well, and who is modest,<br>
who explains the meaning of the Dhamma, his speech is sweet.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc364' href='#sc364' data-uid='dhp364'>SC 364</a>The one who finds pleasure in the Dhamma, delights in Dhamma, reflects on Dhamma,<br>
the monastic who remembers Dhamma, does not abandon the Good Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc365' href='#sc365' data-uid='dhp365'>SC 365</a>One should not despise one’s own gains, one should not live envious of others,<br>
the monastic who is envious of others does not attain concentration.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc366' href='#sc366' data-uid='dhp366'>SC 366</a>Even if a monastic gains little he should not despise his gains,<br>
even the very gods praise the one of pure life who is diligent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc367' href='#sc367' data-uid='dhp367'>SC 367</a>The one who does not have fondness at all for mind and body,<br>
and who grieves not for what does not exist, is surely called a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc368' href='#sc368' data-uid='dhp368'>SC 368</a>That monastic who dwells in loving-kindness, with faith in Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
should attain the state of peace, the joy in stilling of <span class='add'>all</span> conditions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc369' href='#sc369' data-uid='dhp369'>SC 369</a>Please bail out this boat, monastic, when bailed out it will go lightly,<br>
cutting off passion and hatred, from here one will go to Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc370' href='#sc370' data-uid='dhp370'>SC 370</a>One should cut off five, one should abandon five, one should cultivate five more,<br>
the monastic who surmounts five attachments is called a flood-crosser.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc371' href='#sc371' data-uid='dhp371'>SC 371</a>Meditate, monastic, do not be heedless,<br>
do not let your mind swirl around in strands of desire,<br>
do not, heedless, swallow a <span class='add'>hot</span> iron ball,<br>
do not, while burning, cry: ‘This is suffering.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc372' href='#sc372' data-uid='dhp372'>SC 372</a>There is no concentration for one without wisdom, there is no wisdom for one without concentration,<br>
the one who has both concentration and wisdom is indeed in the presence of Nibbāna.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc373' href='#sc373' data-uid='dhp373'>SC 373</a>For the one who has entered an empty place, a monastic with a peaceful mind,<br>
there is superhuman delight from insight into true Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc374' href='#sc374' data-uid='dhp374'>SC 374</a>Whoever has right mindfulness regarding the rise and fall of the components <span class='add'>of mind and body</span><br>
gains joy and happiness, that is the deathless state for the one who knows.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc375' href='#sc375' data-uid='dhp375'>SC 375</a>This is the very beginning for the wise monastic here:<br>
contentment, guarding the senses, and restraint in the regulations.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc376' href='#sc376' data-uid='dhp376'>SC 376</a>One should resort to spiritual friends, ones of pure life, ones who are diligent,<br>
one should be of friendly disposition, one who will be skilful in his conduct,<br>
rejoicing frequently because of that, one will make an end to suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc377' href='#sc377' data-uid='dhp377'>SC 377</a>Just as striped jasmine casts off its withered flowers,<br>
so, monastics, cast off <span class='add'>all</span> passion and hatred.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc378' href='#sc378' data-uid='dhp378'>SC 378</a>Calm in body and calm in speech, having calmness and composure,<br>
having thrown off worldly gain the monastic is called one at peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc379' href='#sc379' data-uid='dhp379'>SC 379</a>By oneself one should censure self, by oneself one should be controlled,<br>
he who guards himself, mindful, will live happily, monastic.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc380' href='#sc380' data-uid='dhp380'>SC 380</a>Self is the protector of self, self is the refuge of self,<br>
therefore one should restrain oneself, as a merchant his noble horse.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc381' href='#sc381' data-uid='dhp381'>SC 381</a>The monastic, having much happiness, with faith in the dispensation of the Buddha,<br>
could attain to the state of peace, happy in the stilling of <span class='add'>all</span> conditions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc382' href='#sc382' data-uid='dhp382'>SC 382</a>That young monastic who is devoted to the Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
shines forth in this world, like the moon freed from a cloud.</p>
