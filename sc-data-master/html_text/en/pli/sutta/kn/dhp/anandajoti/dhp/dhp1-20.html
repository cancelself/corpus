<h1>The Chapter about the Pairs</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1' data-uid='dhp1'>SC 1</a>Mind precedes thoughts, mind is their chief, <span class='add'>their quality is</span> made by mind,<br>
if with a base mind one speaks or acts,<br>
through that suffering follows him like a wheel <span class='add'>follows</span> the ox’s foot.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2' data-uid='dhp2'>SC 2</a>Mind precedes thoughts, mind is their chief, <span class='add'>their quality is</span> made by mind,<br>
if with pure mind one speaks or acts,<br>
through that happiness follows him like a shadow which does not depart.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3' data-uid='dhp3'>SC 3</a>“He abused me, he struck at me, he overcame me, he robbed me,”<br>
those who bear ill-will towards this their hatred is never appeased.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4' data-uid='dhp4'>SC 4</a>“He abused me, he struck at me, he overcame me, he robbed me,”<br>
those who do not bear ill-will towards this their hatred is appeased.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5' data-uid='dhp5'>SC 5</a>For not by hatred do hatreds cease at any time in this place,<br>
they only cease with non-hatred, this truth is <span class='add'>surely</span> eternal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6' data-uid='dhp6'>SC 6</a>The others do not understand that we should restrain ourselves here,<br>
but <span class='add'>for</span> those here who do understand, through that, <span class='add'>their</span> dissensions will cease.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7' data-uid='dhp7'>SC 7</a>Living contemplating what is pleasant, uncontrolled in sense faculties,<br>
not knowing the limit in food, indolent, low in energy –<br>
Māra surely overthrows that one, like wind <span class='add'>overthrows</span> a weak tree.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8' data-uid='dhp8'>SC 8</a>Living contemplating the unpleasant, well-controlled in sense faculties,<br>
and knowing the limit in food, faithful, with energy aroused –<br>
Māra does not overthrow that one, just as wind does not <span class='add'>overthrow</span> a mountain made of rock.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9' data-uid='dhp9'>SC 9</a>The one who, while still impure, would wear the renunciant’s robe,<br>
unendowed with restraint and truth, is not worthy of the renunciant’s robe.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10' data-uid='dhp10'>SC 10</a>The one who, steady in virtue, throws out <span class='add'>any</span> impurity,<br>
endowed with restraint and truth, is indeed worthy of the renunciant’s robe.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11' data-uid='dhp11'>SC 11</a>Finding the essential in what is unessential, and seeing the unessential in what is essential,<br>
they do not understand what is essential, and resort to wrong intention.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12' data-uid='dhp12'>SC 12</a>Knowing the essential in what is essential, and the unessential in what is unessential,<br>
they understand what is essential, and resort to right intention.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13' data-uid='dhp13'>SC 13</a>Just as the rain penetrates a house with thatching that is poor,<br>
so passion penetrates a mind that is undeveloped.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14' data-uid='dhp14'>SC 14</a>Just as rain does not penetrate a house with thatching that is good,<br>
so passion cannot penetrate a mind that is well-developed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15' data-uid='dhp15'>SC 15</a>Here he laments, after death he laments,<br>
the wicked one laments in both places,<br>
he laments, he suffers vexation,<br>
seeing the defilement of his own deeds.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16' data-uid='dhp16'>SC 16</a>Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices,<br>
the meritorious one rejoices in both places,<br>
he rejoices, he greatly rejoices,<br>
seeing the purity of his own deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17' data-uid='dhp17'>SC 17</a>Here he suffers, after death he suffers,<br>
the wicked one suffers in both places,<br>
he suffers, thinking: “I have done wickedness,”<br>
gone to a bad fate, he suffers much more.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18' data-uid='dhp18'>SC 18</a>Here she is happy, after death she is happy,<br>
the righteous one is happy in both places,<br>
she is happy, thinking: “I have done merit,”<br>
gone to a good fate, she is happy much more.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19' data-uid='dhp19'>SC 19</a>Even though reciting abundant scriptures,<br>
the heedless fellow, who does not do <span class='add'>what they say</span>,<br>
like a cowboy counting other’s cattle,<br>
does not partake of the ascetic life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20' data-uid='dhp20'>SC 20</a>Even though reciting but few scriptures,<br>
but living righteously in accordance with Dhamma,<br>
abandoning greed, hate and delusion,<br>
understanding aright, with mind well-released,<br>
that one, unattached here and hereafter,<br>
<span class='add'>surely</span> partakes of the ascetic life.</p>
