<h1>The Chapter about Fools</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc60' href='#sc60' data-uid='dhp60'>SC 60</a>Long is the night for one awake, long is a league for one tired,<br>
long is the round of births and deaths for fools who know not True Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc61' href='#sc61' data-uid='dhp61'>SC 61</a>If while roaming one cannot find one better or the same as oneself,<br>
one should resolve to go alone: there is no friendship with fools.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc62' href='#sc62' data-uid='dhp62'>SC 62</a>“Sons are mine, riches are mine,” so the fool suffers vexation,<br>
when even self is not his own, how then sons, how then riches?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc63' href='#sc63' data-uid='dhp63'>SC 63</a>The fool who knows <span class='add'>his</span> foolishness, is at least wise in that <span class='add'>matter</span>,<br>
the fool who is proud of his wisdom, he is said to be a fool indeed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc64' href='#sc64' data-uid='dhp64'>SC 64</a>Even if a fool attends on a wise man for his whole life long,<br>
he does not learn Dhamma, just as spoon learns not the taste of curry.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc65' href='#sc65' data-uid='dhp65'>SC 65</a>If a perceptive man attends on a wise man even for a second,<br>
he quickly learns Dhamma, just as the tongue <span class='add'>learns</span> the taste of curry.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc66' href='#sc66' data-uid='dhp66'>SC 66</a>Stupid fools live having themselves as their own foes,<br>
committing wicked deeds, which produce bitter fruit.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc67' href='#sc67' data-uid='dhp67'>SC 67</a>That deed is not well done, which, having done, one has regret,<br>
for which he has tears on his face, as the result follows him round.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc68' href='#sc68' data-uid='dhp68'>SC 68</a>But that deed is well done, which, having done, one has no regret,<br>
for which he is pleased and happy, as the result follows him round.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc69' href='#sc69' data-uid='dhp69'>SC 69</a>The fool thinks it sweet, as long as the wicked deed does not ripen,<br>
but when the wicked deed ripens, the fool undergoes suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc70' href='#sc70' data-uid='dhp70'>SC 70</a>From month to month the fool may eat food with the tip of kusa-grass,<br>
<span class='add'>but</span> he is not worth a sixteenth part of those who have mastered Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc71' href='#sc71' data-uid='dhp71'>SC 71</a>A wicked deed that has been done, like milk, does not turn all at once,<br>
smouldering, it follows the fool, like a fire covered with ashes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc72' href='#sc72' data-uid='dhp72'>SC 72</a>As far as learning arises for a fool, it is only to his disadvantage,<br>
it destroys the fool’s good fortune, and it will destroy his head.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc73' href='#sc73' data-uid='dhp73'>SC 73</a>He may wish for the respect that is lacking, and status amongst the monastics,<br>
for control in the living quarters, and worship amongst good families:<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc74' href='#sc74' data-uid='dhp74'>SC 74</a>“Householders and renunciants should both think this was done by me,<br>
let them <span class='add'>all</span> be under my sway, in all to be done and not done”,<br>
so does the fool think, <span class='add'>meanwhile</span> his desires and conceit increase.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc75' href='#sc75' data-uid='dhp75'>SC 75</a>For the means to gains is one thing, the <span class='add'>path</span> going to Nibbāna another,<br>
thus knowing this the monastic disciple of the Buddha<br>
should not delight in honours, <span class='add'>but</span> practise in solitude.</p>
