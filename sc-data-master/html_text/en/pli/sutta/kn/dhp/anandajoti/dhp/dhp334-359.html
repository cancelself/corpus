<h1>The Chapter about Craving</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc334' href='#sc334' data-uid='dhp334'>SC 334</a>For a human who lives life heedlessly<br>
craving increases like a clinging creeper,<br>
he rushes from one place to another<br>
like a monkey desiring fruit in the forest.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc335' href='#sc335' data-uid='dhp335'>SC 335</a>That one who is overcome by these low cravings and attachments in the world,<br>
for him griefs increase like grass that has had heavy rain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc336' href='#sc336' data-uid='dhp336'>SC 336</a>Whoever overcomes this low craving in the world, which is difficult to get past,<br>
griefs fall from him like a drop of water from a lotus.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc337' href='#sc337' data-uid='dhp337'>SC 337</a>This I say to you: “Good luck to as many as have assembled here”,<br>
dig up the root of craving, like one seeking the root <span class='add'>digs up</span> grass,<br>
do not let Māra push you down again like a stream <span class='add'>pushes down</span> the reed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc338' href='#sc338' data-uid='dhp338'>SC 338</a>Just as when the root remains firm and untroubled<br>
though the tree was cut down, it grows again,<br>
so when the tendency to craving is not rooted out<br>
this suffering appears again and again.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc339' href='#sc339' data-uid='dhp339'>SC 339</a>He in whom the thirty-six streams flow pleasantly and strong,<br>
the one with wrong view, is carried away by his passionate intentions.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc340' href='#sc340' data-uid='dhp340'>SC 340</a>Streams are flowing everywhere, the creepers remain where they grow,<br>
seeing this, cut the creeper’s root that has arisen with wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc341' href='#sc341' data-uid='dhp341'>SC 341</a>There are flowing streams of affection and<br>
mental happinesses for a person,<br>
pleasure-dependent they seek happiness,<br>
those people undergo both birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc342' href='#sc342' data-uid='dhp342'>SC 342</a>People surrounded by craving<br>
crawl round like a hare in a trap,<br>
attached and clinging to fetters<br>
they come back again and again to suffering for a long time.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc343' href='#sc343' data-uid='dhp343'>SC 343</a>People surrounded by craving<br>
crawl round like a hare in a trap,<br>
therefore he should remove craving –<br>
the monk who longs for dispassion for himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc344' href='#sc344' data-uid='dhp344'>SC 344</a>The one who is free from desires, who is intent on the forest,<br>
<span class='add'>though</span> free from the forest, runs back to the forest,<br>
come here and look at that person,<br>
<span class='add'>though</span> free, he runs back to bondage.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc345' href='#sc345' data-uid='dhp345'>SC 345</a>That bondage is not so strong say the wise,<br>
that is made of iron or wood or reeds,<br>
impassioned and excited they seek out<br>
jewels and earrings and children and wives –<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc346' href='#sc346' data-uid='dhp346'>SC 346</a>that bondage is strong say the wise,<br>
dragging down the lax, hard to get free from,<br>
having cut this down they wander about<br>
seeking nothing, abandoning the happiness in pleasure.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc347' href='#sc347' data-uid='dhp347'>SC 347</a>Those who are impassioned by passion follow the stream<br>
like a spider a web made by itself,<br>
having cut this away the wise proceed,<br>
seeking nothing, abandoning all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc348' href='#sc348' data-uid='dhp348'>SC 348</a>Be free of the past, be free of the future,<br>
be free of the present, after crossing over <span class='add'>all</span> existence,<br>
with mind liberated in every way,<br>
you will not return to birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc349' href='#sc349' data-uid='dhp349'>SC 349</a>For a person crushed by thoughts<br>
and pierced by passion, contemplating the attractive,<br>
craving increases much more,<br>
this surely makes the bond more firm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc350' href='#sc350' data-uid='dhp350'>SC 350</a>Whoever has delight in the calming of thoughts,<br>
who always mindfully cultivates what is unattractive,<br>
will surely abolish this <span class='add'>craving</span>,<br>
he will cut off the bond of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc351' href='#sc351' data-uid='dhp351'>SC 351</a>Having gone to the end, without trembling, without craving, without impurity,<br>
cutting off the darts of existence, this one is his final body.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc352' href='#sc352' data-uid='dhp352'>SC 352</a>Without craving, without attachment, skilled in words and their explanation,<br>
knowing how syllables are arranged, which come before and which after,<br>
the one in his final body is said to be <span class='add'>a great person</span>, one of great wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc353' href='#sc353' data-uid='dhp353'>SC 353</a>All-Conquering, All-Wise am I,<br>
undefiled regarding all things,<br>
having given up everything, liberated through craving’s destruction,<br>
when having deep knowledge myself, who should I point to <span class='add'>as Teacher</span>?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc354' href='#sc354' data-uid='dhp354'>SC 354</a>The gift of the Dhamma surpasses all other gifts,<br>
the taste of the Dhamma surpasses all other tastes,<br>
the love of the Dhamma surpasses all other loves,<br>
destruction of craving overcomes all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc355' href='#sc355' data-uid='dhp355'>SC 355</a>Riches destroy the stupid one who does not seek the way beyond,<br>
through his craving for riches the stupid one destroys others and himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc356' href='#sc356' data-uid='dhp356'>SC 356</a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds, these people are ruined by passion,<br>
therefore there is great fruit for that given to those without passion.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc357' href='#sc357' data-uid='dhp357'>SC 357</a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds, these people are ruined by hatred,<br>
therefore there is great fruit for that given to those without hatred.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc358' href='#sc358' data-uid='dhp358'>SC 358</a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds, these people are ruined by delusion,<br>
therefore there is great fruit for that given to those without delusion.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc359' href='#sc359' data-uid='dhp359'>SC 359</a>Fields are ruined by grassy weeds, these people are ruined by desire,<br>
therefore there is great fruit for that given to those without desire.</p>
