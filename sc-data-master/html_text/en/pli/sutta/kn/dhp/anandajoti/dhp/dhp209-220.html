<h1>The Chapter about Love</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc209' href='#sc209' data-uid='dhp209'>SC 209</a>Engaging oneself in what is not suitable, not engaging in what is suitable,<br>
abandoning the good, grasping the loved, he envies the one who endeavours for himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc210' href='#sc210' data-uid='dhp210'>SC 210</a>Do not associate at any time with those who are loved or with those unloved,<br>
there is suffering not meeting those loved, and <span class='add'>suffering from</span> meeting those unloved.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc211' href='#sc211' data-uid='dhp211'>SC 211</a>Therefore do not hold <span class='add'>anything</span> as loved, for losing those who are loved is loathsome.<br>
There are no knots for those who hold nothing as loved or as unloved.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc212' href='#sc212' data-uid='dhp212'>SC 212</a>From love there arises grief, from love there arises fear,<br>
for one who is free from love there is no grief, how is there fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc213' href='#sc213' data-uid='dhp213'>SC 213</a>From fondness there arises grief, from fondness there arises fear,<br>
for one who is free from fondness there is no grief, how is there fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc214' href='#sc214' data-uid='dhp214'>SC 214</a>From delight there arises grief, from delight there arises fear,<br>
for one who is free from delight there is no grief, how is there fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc215' href='#sc215' data-uid='dhp215'>SC 215</a>From desire there arises grief, from desire there arises fear,<br>
for one who is free from desire there is no grief, how is there fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc216' href='#sc216' data-uid='dhp216'>SC 216</a>From craving there arises grief, from craving there arises fear,<br>
for one who is free from craving there is no grief, how is there fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc217' href='#sc217' data-uid='dhp217'>SC 217</a>Endowed with virtue and insight, principled, knowing the truths,<br>
doing the deeds that are his own, that one the people love.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc218' href='#sc218' data-uid='dhp218'>SC 218</a>The one with desire arisen for the undeclared, will be suffused with the <span class='add'>awakening</span> mind,<br>
with a mind unconnected with sense pleasures, he is spoken of as ‘one gone upstream’.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc219' href='#sc219' data-uid='dhp219'>SC 219</a>When one who lives abroad for a long time comes safely from afar,<br>
his relatives, friends and companions come and greatly rejoice.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc220' href='#sc220' data-uid='dhp220'>SC 220</a>Just so, when one who has performed merit goes from this world unto the next,<br>
his merits are received just as relatives come to their loved one.</p>
