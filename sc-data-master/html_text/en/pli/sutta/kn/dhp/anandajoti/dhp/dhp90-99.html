<h1>The Chapter about the Arahats</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc90' href='#sc90' data-uid='dhp90'>SC 90</a>For the one who has reached his goal, who grieves not, being released on all sides,<br>
who has abandoned all the knots, no consuming fever is found.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc91' href='#sc91' data-uid='dhp91'>SC 91</a>The mindful ones who are striving do not delight in a dwelling,<br>
like geese who abandon a lake, they abandon fondness for homes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc92' href='#sc92' data-uid='dhp92'>SC 92</a>For those who have no stores, those who comprehend food aright,<br>
for those whose resort is the liberation that is empty or signless,<br>
like the birds in the sky, their track is hard to find.<br>
<a class='ref sc' id='sc93' href='#sc93' data-uid='dhp93'>SC 93</a>For him whose pollutants are destroyed, who is not dependent on the foods,<br>
for him whose resort is the liberation that is empty or signless,<br>
like the birds in the sky, his footprint is hard to find.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc94' href='#sc94' data-uid='dhp94'>SC 94</a>For the one whose senses are stilled,<br>
like horses well-trained by their charioteer,<br>
who has abandoned conceit, who is without pollutants –<br>
even the gods envy such a one.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc95' href='#sc95' data-uid='dhp95'>SC 95</a>One untroubled just like the earth,<br>
steadfast just like a city-post,<br>
like a lake mud-free –<br>
such a one continues not in births and deaths.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc96' href='#sc96' data-uid='dhp96'>SC 96</a>His mind is calm, his speech and his actions are also calm,<br>
liberated by right knowledge, such a one is <span class='add'>truly</span> peaceful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc97' href='#sc97' data-uid='dhp97'>SC 97</a>The person who is beyond <span class='add'>mere</span> faith, who knows that which is unmade, who has cut off <span class='add'>rebirth-</span>linking,<br>
who has destroyed the occasion, who has thrown out hope and desire, is surely the person supreme.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc98' href='#sc98' data-uid='dhp98'>SC 98</a>Whether in the village or wilds, whether on low or on high ground,<br>
wherever the Arahats live, that ground is <span class='add'>surely</span> delightful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc99' href='#sc99' data-uid='dhp99'>SC 99</a>The delightful wildernesses where the people do not delight,<br>
those without passion will take delight, <span class='add'>but</span> not those who seek sense pleasures.</p>
