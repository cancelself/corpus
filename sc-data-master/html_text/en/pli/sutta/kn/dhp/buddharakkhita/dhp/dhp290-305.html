<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc290' href='#sc290' data-uid='dhp290'>SC 290</a>If by renouncing a lesser happiness one may realize a greater happiness, let the wise man renounce the lesser, having regard for the greater.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc291' href='#sc291' data-uid='dhp291'>SC 291</a>Entangled by the bonds of hate, he who seeks his own happiness by inflicting pain on others, is never delivered from hatred.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc293' href='#sc293' data-uid='dhp293'>SC 293</a>The cankers cease for those mindful and clearly comprehending ones who always earnestly practice mindfulness of the body, who do not resort to what should not be done, and steadfastly pursue what should be done.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc294' href='#sc294' data-uid='dhp294'>SC 294</a>Having slain mother (craving), father (self-conceit), two warrior-kings (eternalism and nihilism), and destroyed a country (sense organs and sense objects) together with its treasurer (attachment and lust), ungrieving goes the holy man.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc295' href='#sc295' data-uid='dhp295'>SC 295</a>Having slain mother, father, two brahman kings (two extreme views), and a tiger as the fifth (the five mental hindrances), ungrieving goes the holy man.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc296' href='#sc296' data-uid='dhp296'>SC 296</a>Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily who day and night constantly practice the Recollection of the Qualities of the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc297' href='#sc297' data-uid='dhp297'>SC 297</a>Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily who day and night constantly practice the Recollection of the Qualities of the Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc298' href='#sc298' data-uid='dhp298'>SC 298</a>Those disciples of Gotama ever awaken happily who day and night constantly practice the Recollection of the Qualities of the Sangha.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc302' href='#sc302' data-uid='dhp302'>SC 302</a>Difficult is life as a monk; difficult is it to delight therein. Also difficult and sorrowful is the household life. Suffering comes from association with unequals; suffering comes from wandering in samsara. Therefore, be not an aimless wanderer, be not a pursuer of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc303' href='#sc303' data-uid='dhp303'>SC 303</a>He who is full of faith and virtue, and possesses good repute and wealth—he is respected everywhere, in whatever land he travels.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc304' href='#sc304' data-uid='dhp304'>SC 304</a>The good shine from afar, like the Himalaya mountains. But the wicked are unseen, like arrows shot in the night.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc305' href='#sc305' data-uid='dhp305'>SC 305</a>He who sits alone, sleeps alone, and walks alone, who is strenuous and subdues himself alone, will find delight in the solitude of the forest.</p>
