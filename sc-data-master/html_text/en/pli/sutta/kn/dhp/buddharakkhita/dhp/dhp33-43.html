<h1>The Mind</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33' data-uid='dhp33'>SC 33</a>Just as a fletcher straightens an arrow shaft, even so the discerning man straightens his mind—so fickle and unsteady, so difficult to guard.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34' data-uid='dhp34'>SC 34</a>As a fish when pulled out of water and cast on land throbs and quivers, even so is this mind agitated. Hence should one abandon the realm of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc35' href='#sc35' data-uid='dhp35'>SC 35</a>Wonderful, indeed, it is to subdue the mind, so difficult to subdue, ever swift, and seizing whatever it desires. A tamed mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc36' href='#sc36' data-uid='dhp36'>SC 36</a>Let the discerning man guard the mind, so difficult to detect and extremely subtle, seizing whatever it desires. A guarded mind brings happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc37' href='#sc37' data-uid='dhp37'>SC 37</a>Dwelling in the cave (of the heart), the mind, without form, wanders far and alone. Those who subdue this mind are liberated from the bonds of Mara.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc38' href='#sc38' data-uid='dhp38'>SC 38</a>Wisdom never becomes perfect in one whose mind is not steadfast, who knows not the Good Teaching and whose faith wavers.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc39' href='#sc39' data-uid='dhp39'>SC 39</a>There is no fear for an awakened one, whose mind is not sodden (by lust) nor afflicted (by hate), and who has gone beyond both merit and demerit.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc40' href='#sc40' data-uid='dhp40'>SC 40</a>Realizing that this body is as fragile as a clay pot, and fortifying this mind like a well-fortified city, fight out Mara with the sword of wisdom. Then, guarding the conquest, remain unattached.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc41' href='#sc41' data-uid='dhp41'>SC 41</a>Ere long, alas! This body will lie upon the earth, unheeded and lifeless, like a useless log.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc42' href='#sc42' data-uid='dhp42'>SC 42</a>Whatever harm an enemy may do to an enemy, or a hater to a hater, an ill-directed mind inflicts on oneself a greater harm.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc43' href='#sc43' data-uid='dhp43'>SC 43</a>Neither mother, father, nor any other relative can do one greater good than one’s own well-directed mind.</p>
