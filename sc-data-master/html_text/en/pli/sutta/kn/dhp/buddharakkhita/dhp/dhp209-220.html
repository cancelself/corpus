<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc209' href='#sc209' data-uid='dhp209'>SC 209</a>Giving himself to things to be shunned and not exerting where exertion is needed, a seeker after pleasures, having given up his true welfare, envies those intent upon theirs.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc210' href='#sc210' data-uid='dhp210'>SC 210</a>Seek no intimacy with the beloved and also not with the unloved, for not to see the beloved and to see the unloved, both are painful.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc211' href='#sc211' data-uid='dhp211'>SC 211</a>Therefore hold nothing dear, for separation from the dear is painful. There are no bonds for those who have nothing beloved or unloved.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc212' href='#sc212' data-uid='dhp212'>SC 212</a>From endearment springs grief, from endearment springs fear. For one who is wholly free from endearment there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc213' href='#sc213' data-uid='dhp213'>SC 213</a>From affection springs grief, from affection springs fear. For one who is wholly free from affection there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc214' href='#sc214' data-uid='dhp214'>SC 214</a>From attachment springs grief, from attachment springs fear. For one who is wholly free from attachment there is no grief, whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc215' href='#sc215' data-uid='dhp215'>SC 215</a>From lust springs grief, from lust springs fear. For one who is wholly free from craving there is no grief; whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc216' href='#sc216' data-uid='dhp216'>SC 216</a>From craving springs grief, from craving springs fear. For one who is wholly free from craving there is no grief; whence then fear?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc217' href='#sc217' data-uid='dhp217'>SC 217</a>People hold dear him who embodies virtue and insight, who is principled, has realized the truth, and who himself does what he ought to be doing.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc218' href='#sc218' data-uid='dhp218'>SC 218</a>One who is intent upon the Ineffable (Nibbana), dwells with mind inspired (by supramundane wisdom), and is no more bound by sense pleasures—such a man is called “One Bound Upstream.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc219' href='#sc219' data-uid='dhp219'>SC 219</a>When, after a long absence, a man safely returns from afar, his relatives, friends and well-wishers welcome him home on arrival.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc220' href='#sc220' data-uid='dhp220'>SC 220</a>As kinsmen welcome a dear one on arrival, even so his own good deeds will welcome the doer of good who has gone from this world to the next.</p>
