<h1>The Thousands</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc100' href='#sc100' data-uid='dhp100'>SC 100</a>Better than a thousand useless words is one useful word, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc101' href='#sc101' data-uid='dhp101'>SC 101</a>Better than a thousand useless verses is one useful verse, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc102' href='#sc102' data-uid='dhp102'>SC 102</a>Better than reciting a hundred meaningless verses is the reciting of one verse of Dhamma, hearing which one attains peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc103' href='#sc103' data-uid='dhp103'>SC 103</a>Though one may conquer a thousand times a thousand men in battle, yet he indeed is the noblest victor who conquers himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc104' href='#sc104' data-uid='dhp104'>SC 104</a><a class='ref sc' id='sc105' href='#sc105' data-uid='dhp105'>SC 105</a>Self-conquest is far better than the conquest of others. Not even a god, an angel, Mara or Brahma can turn into defeat the victory of a person who is self-subdued and ever restrained in conduct.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc106' href='#sc106' data-uid='dhp106'>SC 106</a>Though month after month for a hundred years one should offer sacrifices by the thousands, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds that honor is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc107' href='#sc107' data-uid='dhp107'>SC 107</a>Though for a hundred years one should tend the sacrificial fire in the forest, yet if only for a moment one should worship those of perfected minds, that worship is indeed better than a century of sacrifice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc108' href='#sc108' data-uid='dhp108'>SC 108</a>Whatever gifts and oblations one seeking merit might offer in this world for a whole year, all that is not worth one fourth of the merit gained by revering the Upright Ones, which is truly excellent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc109' href='#sc109' data-uid='dhp109'>SC 109</a>To one ever eager to revere and serve the elders, these four blessing accrue: long life and beauty, happiness and power.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc110' href='#sc110' data-uid='dhp110'>SC 110</a>Better it is to live one day virtuous and meditative than to live a hundred years immoral and uncontrolled.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc111' href='#sc111' data-uid='dhp111'>SC 111</a>Better it is to live one day wise and meditative than to live a hundred years foolish and uncontrolled.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc112' href='#sc112' data-uid='dhp112'>SC 112</a>Better it is to live one day strenuous and resolute than to live a hundred years sluggish and dissipated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc113' href='#sc113' data-uid='dhp113'>SC 113</a>Better it is to live one day seeing the rise and fall of things than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the rise and fall of things.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc114' href='#sc114' data-uid='dhp114'>SC 114</a>Better it is to live one day seeing the Deathless than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Deathless.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc115' href='#sc115' data-uid='dhp115'>SC 115</a>Better it is to live one day seeing the Supreme Truth than to live a hundred years without ever seeing the Supreme Truth.</p>
