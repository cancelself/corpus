<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc44' href='#sc44' data-uid='dhp44'>SC 44</a>Who shall overcome this earth, this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods? Who shall bring to perfection the well-taught path of wisdom as an expert garland-maker would his floral design?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc45' href='#sc45' data-uid='dhp45'>SC 45</a>A striver-on-the path shall overcome this earth, this realm of Yama and this sphere of men and gods. The striver-on-the-path shall bring to perfection the well-taught path of wisdom, as an expert garland-maker would his floral design.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46' data-uid='dhp46'>SC 46</a>Realizing that this body is like froth, penetrating its mirage-like nature, and plucking out Mara’s flower-tipped arrows of sensuality, go beyond sight of the King of Death!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc47' href='#sc47' data-uid='dhp47'>SC 47</a>As a mighty flood sweeps away the sleeping village, so death carries away the person of distracted mind who only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc48' href='#sc48' data-uid='dhp48'>SC 48</a>The Destroyer brings under his sway the person of distracted mind who, insatiate in sense desires, only plucks the flowers (of pleasure).</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49' data-uid='dhp49'>SC 49</a>As a bee gathers honey from the flower without injuring its color or fragrance, even so the sage goes on his alms-round in the village.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc50' href='#sc50' data-uid='dhp50'>SC 50</a>Let none find fault with others; let none see the omissions and commissions of others. But let one see one’s own acts, done and undone.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc51' href='#sc51' data-uid='dhp51'>SC 51</a>Like a beautiful flower full of color but without fragrance, even so, fruitless are the fair words of one who does not practice them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc52' href='#sc52' data-uid='dhp52'>SC 52</a>Like a beautiful flower full of color and also fragrant, even so, fruitful are the fair words of one who practices them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc53' href='#sc53' data-uid='dhp53'>SC 53</a>As from a great heap of flowers many garlands can be made, even so should many good deeds be done by one born a mortal.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc54' href='#sc54' data-uid='dhp54'>SC 54</a>Not the sweet smell of flowers, not even the fragrance of sandal, <i>tagara,</i> or jasmine blows against the wind. But the fragrance of the virtuous blows against the wind. Truly the virtuous man pervades all directions with the fragrance of his virtue.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc55' href='#sc55' data-uid='dhp55'>SC 55</a>Of all the fragrances—sandal, <i>tagara,</i> blue lotus and jasmine—the fragrance of virtue is the sweetest.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc56' href='#sc56' data-uid='dhp56'>SC 56</a>Faint is the fragrance of <i>tagara</i> and sandal, but excellent is the fragrance of the virtuous, wafting even amongst the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc57' href='#sc57' data-uid='dhp57'>SC 57</a>Mara never finds the path of the truly virtuous, who abide in heedfulness and are freed by perfect knowledge.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc58' href='#sc58' data-uid='dhp58'>SC 58</a>Upon a heap of rubbish in the road-side ditch blooms a lotus, fragrant and pleasing.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc59' href='#sc59' data-uid='dhp59'>SC 59</a>Even so, on the rubbish heap of blinded mortals the disciple of the Supremely Enlightened One shines resplendent in wisdom.</p>
