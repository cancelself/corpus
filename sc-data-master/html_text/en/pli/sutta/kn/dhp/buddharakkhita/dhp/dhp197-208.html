<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc199' href='#sc199' data-uid='dhp199'>SC 199</a>Happy indeed we live, free from avarice amidst the avaricious. Amidst the avaricious men we dwell free from avarice.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc200' href='#sc200' data-uid='dhp200'>SC 200</a>Happy indeed we live, we who possess nothing. Feeders on joy we shall be, like the Radiant Gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc201' href='#sc201' data-uid='dhp201'>SC 201</a>Victory begets enmity; the defeated dwell in pain. Happily the peaceful live, discarding both victory and defeat.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc202' href='#sc202' data-uid='dhp202'>SC 202</a>There is no fire like lust and no crime like hatred. There is no ill like the aggregates (of existence) and no bliss higher than the peace (of Nibbana).</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc203' href='#sc203' data-uid='dhp203'>SC 203</a>Hunger is the worst disease, conditioned things the worst suffering. Knowing this as it really is, the wise realize Nibbana, the highest bliss.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc204' href='#sc204' data-uid='dhp204'>SC 204</a>Health is the most precious gain and contentment the greatest wealth. A trustworthy person is the best kinsman, Nibbana the highest bliss.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc207' href='#sc207' data-uid='dhp207'>SC 207</a>Indeed, he who moves in the company of fools grieves for longing. Association with fools is ever painful, like partnership with an enemy. But association with the wise is happy, like meeting one’s own kinsmen.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc208' href='#sc208' data-uid='dhp208'>SC 208</a>Therefore, follow the Noble One, who is steadfast, wise, learned, dutiful and devout. One should follow only such a man, who is truly good and discerning, even as the moon follows the path of the stars.</p>
