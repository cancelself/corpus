<h1>Anger</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc221' href='#sc221' data-uid='dhp221'>SC 221</a>One should give up anger, renounce pride, and overcome all fetters. Suffering never befalls him who clings not to mind and body and is detached.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc222' href='#sc222' data-uid='dhp222'>SC 222</a>He who checks rising anger as a charioteer checks a rolling chariot, him I call a true charioteer. Others only hold the reins.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc223' href='#sc223' data-uid='dhp223'>SC 223</a>Overcome the angry by non-anger; overcome the wicked by goodness; overcome the miser by generosity; overcome the liar by truth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc224' href='#sc224' data-uid='dhp224'>SC 224</a>Speak the truth; yield not to anger; when asked, give even if you only have a little. By these three means can one reach the presence of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc225' href='#sc225' data-uid='dhp225'>SC 225</a>Those sages who are inoffensive and ever restrained in body, go to the Deathless State, where, having gone, they grieve no more.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc226' href='#sc226' data-uid='dhp226'>SC 226</a>Those who are ever vigilant, who discipline themselves day and night, and are ever intent upon Nibbana—their defilements fade away.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc227' href='#sc227' data-uid='dhp227'>SC 227</a>O Atula! Indeed, this is an ancient practice, not one only of today: they blame those who remain silent, they blame those who speak much, they blame those who speak in moderation. There is none in the world who is not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc228' href='#sc228' data-uid='dhp228'>SC 228</a>There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a person who is wholly blamed or wholly praised.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc229' href='#sc229' data-uid='dhp229'>SC 229</a>But the man whom the wise praise, after observing him day after day, is one of flawless character, wise, and endowed with knowledge and virtue.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc230' href='#sc230' data-uid='dhp230'>SC 230</a>Who can blame such a one, as worthy as a coin of refined gold? Even the gods praise him; by Brahma, too, is he praised.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc231' href='#sc231' data-uid='dhp231'>SC 231</a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in bodily action; let him be controlled in deed. Abandoning bodily misconduct, let him practice good conduct in deed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc232' href='#sc232' data-uid='dhp232'>SC 232</a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in speech; let him be controlled in speech. Abandoning verbal misconduct, let him practice good conduct in speech.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc233' href='#sc233' data-uid='dhp233'>SC 233</a>Let a man guard himself against irritability in thought; let him be controlled in mind. Abandoning mental misconduct, let him practice good conduct in thought.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc234' href='#sc234' data-uid='dhp234'>SC 234</a>The wise are controlled in bodily action, controlled in speech and controlled in thought. They are truly well-controlled.</p>
