<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc146' href='#sc146' data-uid='dhp146'>SC 146</a>When this world is ever ablaze, why this laughter, why this jubilation? Shrouded in darkness, will you not see the light?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc147' href='#sc147' data-uid='dhp147'>SC 147</a>Behold this body—a painted image, a mass of heaped up sores, infirm, full of hankering—of which nothing is lasting or stable!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc148' href='#sc148' data-uid='dhp148'>SC 148</a>Fully worn out is this body, a nest of disease, and fragile. This foul mass breaks up, for death is the end of life.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc149' href='#sc149' data-uid='dhp149'>SC 149</a>These dove-colored bones are like gourds that lie scattered about in autumn. Having seen them, how can one seek delight?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc150' href='#sc150' data-uid='dhp150'>SC 150</a>This city (body) is built of bones, plastered with flesh and blood; within are decay and death, pride and jealousy.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc151' href='#sc151' data-uid='dhp151'>SC 151</a>Even gorgeous royal chariots wear out, and indeed this body too wears out. But the Dhamma of the Good does not age; thus the Good make it known to the good.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc152' href='#sc152' data-uid='dhp152'>SC 152</a>The man of little learning grows old like a bull. He grows only in bulk, but, his wisdom does not grow.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc153' href='#sc153' data-uid='dhp153'>SC 153</a>Through many a birth in samsara have I wandered in vain, seeking the builder of this house (of life). Repeated birth is indeed suffering!</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc154' href='#sc154' data-uid='dhp154'>SC 154</a>O house-builder, you are seen! You will not build this house again. For your rafters are broken and your ridgepole shattered. My mind has reached the Unconditioned; I have attained the destruction of craving.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc155' href='#sc155' data-uid='dhp155'>SC 155</a>Those who in youth have not led the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, languish like old cranes in the pond without fish.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc156' href='#sc156' data-uid='dhp156'>SC 156</a>Those who in youth have not lead the holy life, or have failed to acquire wealth, lie sighing over the past, like worn out arrows (shot from) a bow.</p>
