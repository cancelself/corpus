<h1>The Buddha’s Words on Loving-Kindness</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>This is what should be done<br>
By one who is skilled in goodness,<br>
And who knows the path of peace:<br>
Let them be able and upright,<br>
Straightforward and gentle in speech,<br>
Humble and not conceited,<br>
Contented and easily satisfied,<br>
Unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways.<br>
Peaceful and calm and wise and skillful,<br>
Not proud or demanding in nature.<br>
Let them not do the slightest thing<br>
That the wise would later reprove.<br>
Wishing: In gladness and in safety,<br>
May all beings be at ease.<br>
Whatever living beings there may be;<br>
Whether they are weak or strong, omitting none,<br>
The great or the mighty, medium, short or small,<br>
The seen and the unseen,<br>
Those living near and far away,<br>
Those born and to-be-born—<br>
May all beings be at ease!</p>
<p>Let none deceive another,<br>
Or despise any being in any state.<br>
Let none through anger or ill-will<br>
Wish harm upon another.<br>
Even as a mother protects with her life<br>
Her child, her only child,<br>
So with a boundless heart<br>
Should one cherish all living beings;<br>
Radiating kindness over the entire world:<br>
Spreading upwards to the skies,<br>
And downwards to the depths;<br>
Outwards and unbounded,<br>
Freed from hatred and ill-will.<br>
Whether standing or walking, seated or lying down<br>
Free from drowsiness,<br>
One should sustain this recollection.<br>
This is said to be the sublime abiding.<br>
By not holding to fixed views,<br>
The pure-hearted one, having clarity of vision,<br>
Being freed from all sense desires,<br>
Is not born again into this world.</p>
