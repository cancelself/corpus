<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Whatever beings <span class='add'>(non-humans)</span> are assembled here, terrestrial or celestial, may they all have peace of mind, and may they listen attentively to these words:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“O beings, listen closely. May you all radiate loving-kindness to those human beings who, by day and night, bring offerings to you <span class='add'>(offer merit to you)</span>. Wherefore, protect them with diligence.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Whatever treasure there be either in the world beyond, whatever precious jewel there be in the heavenly worlds, there is nought comparable to the Tathagata <span class='add'>(the perfect One)</span>. This precious jewel is the Buddha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“That Cessation, that Detachment, that Deathlessness <span class='add'>(Nibbana)</span> supreme, the calm and collected Sakyan Sage <span class='add'>(the Buddha)</span> had realized. There is nought comparable to this <span class='add'>(Nibbana)</span> Dhamma. This precious jewel is the Dhamma. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“The Supreme Buddha extolled a path of purity <span class='add'>(the Noble Eightfold Path)</span> calling it the path which unfailingly brings concentration. There is nought comparable to this concentration. This precious jewel is the Dhamma. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“The eight persons extolled by virtuous men constitute four pairs. They are the disciples of the Buddha and are worthy of offerings. Gifts given to them yield rich results. This precious jewel is the Sangha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“With a steadfast mind, and applying themselves well in the dispensation of the Buddha Gotama, free from <span class='add'>defilements</span>, they have attained to that which should be attained <span class='add'>(arahantship)</span> encountering the Deathless. They enjoy the Peace of Nibbana freely obtained. This precious jewel is the Sangha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“As a post deep-planted in the earth stands unshaken by the winds from the four quarters, so, too, I declare is the righteous man who comprehends with wisdom the Noble Truths. This precious jewel is the Sangha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Those who realized the Noble Truths well taught by him who is profound in wisdom <span class='add'>(the Buddha)</span>, even though they may be exceedingly heedless, they will not take an eighth existence <span class='add'>in the realm of sense spheres</span>. This precious jewel is the Sangha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“With his gaining of insight he abandons three states of mind, namely self-illusion, doubt, and indulgence in meaningless rites and rituals, should there be any. He is also fully freed from the four states of woe, and therefore, incapable of committing the six major wrongdoings. This precious jewel is the Sangha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Any evil action he may still do by deed, word or thought, he is incapable of concealing it; since it has been proclaimed that such concealing is impossible for one who has seen the Path <span class='add'>of Nibbana</span>. This precious jewel is the Sangha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“As the woodland groves though in the early heat of the summer month are crowned with blossoming flowers even so is the sublime Dhamma leading to the <span class='add'>calm</span> of Nibbana which is taught <span class='add'>by the Buddha</span> for the highest good. This precious jewel is the Buddha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“The Peerless Excellent one <span class='add'>(the Buddha)</span> the Knower <span class='add'>of Nibbana</span>, the Giver <span class='add'>of Nibbana</span>, the Bringer <span class='add'>of the Noble Path</span>, taught the excellent Dhamma. This precious jewel is the Buddha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Their past <span class='add'>kamma</span> is spent, their new <span class='add'>kamma</span> no more arises, their mind to future becoming is unattached. Their germ <span class='add'>of rebirth-consciousness</span> has died, they have no more desire for re-living. Those wise men fade out <span class='add'>of existence</span> as the flame of this lamp <span class='add'>which has just faded away</span>. This precious jewel is the Sangha. By this <span class='add'>asseveration of the</span> truth may there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Whatever beings <span class='add'>(non-human)</span> are assembled here, terrestrial or celestial, come let us salute the Buddha, the Tathagata <span class='add'>(the perfect One)</span>, honored by gods and men. May there be happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Whatever beings are assembled here terrestrial or celestial, come let us salute the perfect Dhamma, honored by gods and men. May there be happiness</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Whatever beings are assembled here terrestrial or celestial, come let us salute the perfect Sangha, honored by gods and men. May there be happiness.”</p>
