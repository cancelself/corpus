<h1>The Discourse on Loving-kindness</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>He who is skilled in <span class='add'>working out his own</span> well being, and who wishes to attain that state of Calm <span class='add'>(Nibbana)</span> should act thus: he should be dexterous, upright, exceedingly upright, obedient, gentle, and humble.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Contented, easily supportable, with but few responsibilities, of simple livelihood, controlled in the senses, prudent, courteous, and not hanker after association with families.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Let him not perform the slightest wrong for which wise men may rebuke him. <span class='add'>Let him think:</span> ‘May all beings be happy and safe. May they have happy minds.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Whatever living beings there may be—feeble or strong <span class='add'>(or the seekers and the attained)</span> long, stout, or of medium size, short, small, large, those seen or those unseen, those dwelling far or near, those who are born as well as those yet to be born—may all beings have happy minds.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Let him not deceive another nor despise anyone anywhere. In anger or ill will let him not wish another ill.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Just as a mother would protect her only child with her life even so let one cultivate a boundless love towards all beings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>Let him radiate boundless love towards the entire world—above, below, and across—unhindered, without ill will, without enmity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>Standing, walking, sitting or reclining, as long as he is awake, let him develop this mindfulness. This, they say, is ‘Noble Living’ here.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>Not falling into wrong views—being virtuous, endowed with insight, lust in the senses discarded—verily never again will he return to conceive in a womb.</p>
