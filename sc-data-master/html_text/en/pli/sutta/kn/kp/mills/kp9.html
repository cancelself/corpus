<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns143' href='#vns143'>SC Verse 143</a>What should be done by one<br>
who is skilled in wholesomeness,<br>
to gain the State of Peacefulness is this:<br>
One should be able, upright, straight and not proud,<br>
easy to speak to, mild and well content,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns144' href='#vns144'>SC Verse 144</a>easily satisfied and not caught up<br>
in too much bustle, and frugal in one’s ways,<br>
with senses calmed, intelligent, not bold,<br>
not being covetous when with other folk,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns145' href='#vns145'>SC Verse 145</a>not even doing little things that other wise ones blame.<br>
(And this the thought that one should always hold):<br>
“May beings all live happily and safe,<br>
and may their hearts rejoice within themselves.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns146' href='#vns146'>SC Verse 146</a>Whatever there may be with breath of life,<br>
whether they be frail or very strong,<br>
without exception, be they long or short,<br>
or middle-sized, or be big or small,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns147' href='#vns147'>SC Verse 147</a>or dense, or visible or invisible,<br>
or whether they dwell far or they dwell near,<br>
those that are here, those seeking to exist—<br>
may beings all rejoice within themselves.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns148' href='#vns148'>SC Verse 148</a>Let no one bring about another’s ruin<br>
and not despise in any way or place;<br>
let them not wish each other any ill<br>
from provocation or from enmity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns149' href='#vns149'>SC Verse 149</a>Just as a mother at the risk of life<br>
loves and protects her child, her only child,<br>
so one should cultivate this boundless love<br>
to all that live in the whole universe—</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns150' href='#vns150'>SC Verse 150</a>extending from a consciousness sublime<br>
upwards and downwards and across the world,<br>
untroubled, free from hate and enmity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns151' href='#vns151'>SC Verse 151</a>And while one stands or walks or sits<br>
or lies down still free from drowsiness,<br>
one should be intent on this mindfulness—<br>
this is divine abiding here they say.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a><a class='ref vns' id='vns152' href='#vns152'>SC Verse 152</a>But when one lives quite free from any view,<br>
is virtuous, with perfect insight won,<br>
and greed for selfish desires let go,<br>
one surely comes no more to be reborn.</p>
