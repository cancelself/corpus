<h1>The Discourse on the Amount of Savings</h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>A man stores his savings<br>
in a deep pit close to water <span class='add'>thinking</span>:<br>
“When a duty or need has arisen<br>
it will be there to help me,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>to free me from a king if slandered, or from molestation<br>
from a thief, or from a debt, or famine, or accident.”<br>
For this kind of help, savings are stored up in the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Although it is well stored<br>
in a deep pit, close to water,<br>
still, it cannot help him in all things on every occasion,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>for perhaps those savings are removed from that place,<br>
or he forgets the signs <span class='add'>telling where they lie</span>,<br>
or nāgas take them away,<br>
or yakkhas carry them off,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>or the heirs he dislikes<br>
extract them unseen,<br>
and when his merit comes to an end<br>
all of it will be destroyed.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>But that woman or man who through giving, virtue,<br>
restraint, and self-control has well stored up his savings,<br>
<span class='add'>placing them</span> in a shrine, or in the Sangha,<br>
or in an individual, or a guest,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>or in his mother or father,<br>
also in an elder brother,<br>
those savings are well stored up,<br>
they follow one, they do not decay.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a><span class='add'>Riches</span> he gives up when he has to leave <span class='add'>this life</span><br>
but this goes along <span class='add'>with him</span>.<br>
It is not shared with others,<br>
no thief carries those savings away,</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>the wise man should make merit,<br>
<span class='add'>for</span> those savings follow one along.<br>
These savings satisfy every desire of gods and men,<br>
whatever they wish for,<br>
through this <span class='add'>merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>A good appearance, a good voice,<br>
a good shape, a good form,<br>
sovereignty, and a retinue,<br>
through this <span class='add'>merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>A local kingship, an empire,<br>
and whatever happiness a Wheel-Rolling <span class='add'>King</span> has,<br>
also godly kingship in the heavens,<br>
through this <span class='add'>merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>Human good fortune,<br>
delight in the world of the gods,<br>
even the attainment of Emancipation,<br>
through this <span class='add'>merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>With the attainment of <span class='add'>good</span> friends,<br>
devotion to systematic <span class='add'>thought</span>,<br>
there is the power of understanding and freedom,<br>
through this <span class='add'>merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>The discriminations, and the liberations,<br>
and whatever perfections the disciples have,<br>
Independent Awakening, the Buddhas’ ground,<br>
through this <span class='add'>merit</span> they receive all.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>So this is of great benefit,<br>
that is to say, the attainment of merit,<br>
therefore the wise and intelligent <span class='add'>always</span> praise the making of merit.</p>
