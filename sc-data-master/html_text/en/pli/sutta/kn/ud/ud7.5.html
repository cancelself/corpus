<h1>The Discourse about Bhaddiya the Dwarf</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf close behind many monks went to the Gracious One.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>The Gracious One saw venerable Bhaddiya the Dwarf coming while still far away close behind many monks, ugly, unsightly, and deformed, whom almost all of the monks ignored. Having seen <span class='add'>that</span>, he addressed the monks, <span class='add'>saying</span>: “Do you see, monks, that monk coming while still far away close behind many monks, ugly, unsightly, and deformed, whom almost all of the monks ignore?”</p>
<p>“Yes, reverend Sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“That monk, monks, is one of great power and great majesty. There is no well-gained attainment which has not been already attained by that monk, <span class='add'>including</span> that good for which sons of good family rightly go forth from the home to the homeless life, that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life, and he dwells having known, directly experienced, and attained it himself in this very life.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“With faultless wheel, with a white covering, the one-spoked chariot rolls on,<br>
See the untroubled one coming, who has cut off the stream, who is unbound.”</p>
</blockquote>
