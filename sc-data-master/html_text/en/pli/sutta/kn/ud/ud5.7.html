<h1>The Discourse about Revata</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Kaṅkhārevata <span class='add'>Doubting Revata</span> was sitting not far away from the Gracious One, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own purification through crossing over doubt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>The Gracious One saw venerable Kaṅkhārevata sat not far away, after folding his legs crosswise, and setting his body straight, reflecting on his own purification through crossing over doubt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Whatever doubts there are <span class='add'>about</span> here or hereafter,<br>
Understandable by oneself, or understandable by another,<br>
The meditators give up all these,<br>
The ardent ones living the spiritual life.”</p>
