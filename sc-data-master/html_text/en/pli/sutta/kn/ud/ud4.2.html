<h1>The Discourse about Agitation</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Kusinārā, at Upavattana, in the Mallas’ Sāl Wood. Then at that time many monks were dwelling in a little forest hut not far from the Gracious One, agitated, arrogant, fickle, garrulous, of loose speech, unmindful, not fully understanding, uncomposed, with minds very unsteady, and with faculties uncontrolled.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>The Gracious One saw those many monks dwelling in a little forest hut not far away, agitated, arrogant, fickle, garrulous, of loose speech, unmindful, not fully understanding, uncomposed, with minds very unsteady, and with faculties uncontrolled. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Through unprotected body, and through attainment of wrong view,<br>
Through being overcome by sloth and torpor one goes under the power of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Therefore one should be of protected mind, one whose resort is right thought,<br>
Devoted to right view, having come to know rise and fall.<br>
The monk who overcomes sloth and torpor will give up all bad destinies.”</p>
