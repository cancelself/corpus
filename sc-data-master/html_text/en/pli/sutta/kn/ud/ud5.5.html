<h1>The Discourse about the Observance</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, at the Eastern Monastery in Migāra’s mother’s mansion. Then at that time the Gracious One was sitting surrounded by the Community of monks on the Observance Day.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then venerable Ānanda, when the night had passed, when the first watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Gracious One: “The night has passed, reverend Sir, the first watch of the night has gone, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Gracious One recite the Pātimokkha for the monks.”</p>
<p>When that was said, the Gracious One was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>For a second time venerable Ānanda, when the night had passed, when the middle watch of the night had gone, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Gracious One: “The night has passed, reverend Sir, the middle watch of the night has gone, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Gracious One recite the Pātimokkha for the monks.”</p>
<p>For a second time the Gracious One was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>For a third time venerable Ānanda, when the night had passed, when the last watch of the night had gone, when dawn had risen, when the night had a joyful appearance, after rising from his seat, arranging his robe on one shoulder, and raising his hands in respectful salutation, said this to the Gracious One: “The night has passed, reverend Sir, the last watch of the night has gone, dawn has risen, the night has a joyful appearance, for a long time the Community of monks has been sitting, may the Gracious One recite the Pātimokkha for the monks.”</p>
<p>“The assembly is not completely pure, Ānanda.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Then it occurred to venerable Mahāmoggallāna: “With regard to which person did the Gracious One say this: ‘The assembly is not completely pure, Ānanda’? ” Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna applied his mind and encompassed fully the whole of that Community of monks with his mind. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna saw that person who was lacking in virtue, of bad character, of impure and doubtful conduct, who covered up his deeds, who was not an ascetic, though making it known he was an ascetic, who was not living the spiritual life, though making it known he was living the spiritual life, who was filthy inside, polluted, and gone rotten, sat in the middle of the Community of monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Having seen <span class='add'>him</span>, after rising from his seat he went to that person, and after going, he said this to that person: “Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Gracious One, there is no longer communion for you with the monks.”</p>
<p>Then that person was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>For a second time venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this to that person: “Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Gracious One, there is no longer communion for you with the monks.”</p>
<p>For a second time that person was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>For a third time venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this to that person: “Get up, friend, you have been seen by the Gracious One, there is no longer communion for you with the monks.”</p>
<p>For a third time that person was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>Then venerable Mahāmoggallāna, having taken that person by the arm, having expelled him outside the doorway, and drawn the lock, went to the Gracious One, and after going, he said this to the Gracious One: “I have expelled that person, reverend Sir, the assembly is <span class='add'>now</span> completely pure, may the Gracious One, venerable Sir, recite the Pātimokkha for the monks.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“It is wonderful, Moggallāna, it is marvellous, Moggallāna, how that foolish person waited until he was grabbed by the arm.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks: “From now onwards, monks, I will not hold the Observance, or recite the Pātimokkha. From now onwards, monks, you must hold the Observance, and recite the Pātimokkha. This is impossible, monks, it is not permitted, that the Realised One should hold the Observance in an assembly that is not completely pure, and should recite the Pātimokkha.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“There are these eight wonderful and marvellous things about the great ocean, monks, which, having seen and considered, the Asuras delight in the great ocean. Which eight?</p>
