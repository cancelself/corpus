<h1>The Discourse about Saṅgāmajī</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta’s Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then at that time venerable Saṅgāmajī had arrived at Sāvatthī to see the Gracious One.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife heard: “Master Saṅgāmajī it seems has arrived at Sāvatthī”, and taking her little boy she went to Jeta’s Wood.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then at that time venerable Saṅgāmajī was dwelling for the day sat at the root of a certain tree. Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife went to venerable Saṅgāmajī, and after going, she said to venerable Saṅgāmajī: “I have a little son, ascetic, you must take care of me.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>After that was said, venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>For a second time venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife said to venerable Saṅgāmajī: “I have a little son, ascetic, you must take care of me.”</p>
<p>For a second time venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>For a third time venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife said to venerable Saṅgāmajī: “I have a little son, ascetic, you must take care of me.”</p>
<p>For a third time venerable Saṅgāmajī was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife, having put the boy down in front of venerable Saṅgāmajī, went away, <span class='add'>saying</span>: “This is your son, ascetic, you must take care of him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>But venerable Saṅgāmajī did not look at the boy, nor did he speak <span class='add'>to him</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>Then venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife having gone not far away, looking round saw that venerable Saṅgāmajī was neither looking at the boy, nor was he speaking <span class='add'>to him</span>. Having seen <span class='add'>that</span> this occured to her: “This ascetic does not even have need of a son.” Therefore, after turning back and taking the boy, she went away.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>The Gracious One saw with the divine-eye which is purified, and surpasses that of <span class='add'>normal</span> men, that venerable Saṅgāmajī’s former wife had such bad manners. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“In <span class='add'>her</span> coming he does not rejoice, in <span class='add'>her</span> leaving he does not grieve,<br>
Saṅgāmajī ‘Victorious in Battle’, free from the shackle: him I call a brāhmaṇa.”</p>
