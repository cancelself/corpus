<h1>The Discourse about Kassapa</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Wood, at the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. Then at that time venerable Mahākassapa was dwelling in the Pepper Cave, and was afflicted, suffering, and very sick.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then venerable Mahākassapa at another time arose from that affliction. Then this occured to venerable Mahākassapa when he arose from that affliction: “Well now, I should enter Rājagaha for alms.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then at that time five hundred devatās were ready and eager to offer almsfood to venerable Mahākassapa. But venerable Mahākassapa, after refusing those five hundred devatās, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms, <span class='add'>going</span> to the poor streets, to the wretched streets, to the weaver’s streets.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>The Gracious One saw venerable Mahākassapa walking for alms in Rājagaha, <span class='add'>going</span> to the poor streets, to the wretched streets, to the weaver’s streets. Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Not nourishing another, well-known, controlled, established in the essential,<br>
With pollutants destroyed, rid of faults: him I call a brāhmaṇa.”</p>
