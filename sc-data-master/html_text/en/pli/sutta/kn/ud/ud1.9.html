<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Gayā, on Gayā Peak. Then at that time many knotted-haired ascetics, in the cold Winter nights, in between ‘the eights’, at the time of the snowfall, in the Gayā <span class='add'>river</span>, were plunging out, and plunging in, were plunging out and in, were sprinkling <span class='add'>water</span>, and were offering the fire sacrifice, <span class='add'>thinking</span>: “Through this there is purity.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>The Gracious One saw that those many knotted-haired ascetics, in the Winter nights, in between ‘the eights’, at the time of the snowfall, in the Gayā <span class='add'>river</span>, were plunging out and plunging in, were plunging out and in, were sprinkling <span class='add'>water</span>, and were offering the fire sacrifice, <span class='add'>thinking</span>: “Through this there is purity.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Not through water is there purity—many people bathe here!<br>
In whom there is truth and Dhamma, he is pure, and he is a brāhmaṇa.”</p>
