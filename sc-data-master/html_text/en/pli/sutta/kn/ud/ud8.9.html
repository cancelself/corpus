<h1>The First Discourse about Dabba</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Rājagaha, in Bamboo Wood, at the Squirrels’ Feeding Place. Then venerable Dabba Mallaputta went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, he sat down on one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>While sat on one side venerable Dabba Mallaputta said this to the Gracious One: “Now is the time for my Complete Emancipation, Fortunate One.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Now is the time for whatever you are thinking, Dabba.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then venerable Dabba Mallaputta, after rising from his seat, worshipping and circumambulating the Gracious One, after going up into the sky, and sitting in cross-legged posture in the air, in the firmament, entering the fire-element, and emerging, attained Complete Emancipation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Then while venerable Dabba Mallaputta—after going up into the sky, and sitting in cross-legged posture in the air, in the firmament, entering the fire-element, and emerging—was attaining Complete Emancipation, his body burning and being consumed, there was no charcoal and no ash evident.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Just as while ghee or oil is burning and being consumed there is no charcoal and no ash evident, so also while venerable Dabba Mallaputta—after going up into the sky, and sitting in cross-legged posture in the air, in the firmament, entering the fire-element, and emerging—was attaining Complete Emancipation, his body burning and being consumed, there was no charcoal and no ash evident.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“The body broke up, perception ceased,<br>
All feelings became cool,<br>
<span class='add'>Mental</span> processes were pacified,<br>
consciousness came to rest.”</p>
</blockquote>
