I chose <span class='add'>to seek</span> ordination. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw29' href='#vjw29'>Verse 29</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw445-446' href='#jw445-446'>Walt 445-446</a> Our father did not permit it;<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw449' href='#jw449'>Walt 449</a>Once when the Sun Among People<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw450' href='#jw450'>Walt 450</a> Due to those karmas done very well,<br>

After that, due to that virtue,<br>
they gave the name “Khemā” to me. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw37' href='#vjw37'>Verse 37</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw453' href='#jw453'>Walt 453</a> When I attained the prime of youth,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw455' href='#jw455'>Walt 455</a> At that time, King Bimbisāra,<br>
with knowledge and great love for me,<br>
after praising the Bamboo Grove,<br>
brought singers <span class='add'>to praise it</span> for me: <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw40' href='#vjw40'>Verse 40</a></p>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw460' href='#jw460'>Walt 460</a> Hearing of its magnificence<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw461' href='#jw461'>Walt 461</a> Then <span class='add'>the king,</span> the lord of the earth,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw463' href='#jw463'>Walt 463</a> And when the Sage, <span class='add'>out begging</span> alms,<br>
had entered Rajgir, best city,<br>

<span class='add'>desiring</span> to look at that grove. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw48' href='#vjw48'>Verse 48</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw464' href='#jw464'>Walt 464</a> Then <span class='add'>I entered</span> that grove in bloom,<br>
<span class='add'>alive</span> with varied bees buzzing,<br>

Not ever in the past was seen<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw477' href='#jw477'>Walt 477</a> ears shriveled up, eyes formed cataracts,<br>

just as is that, so too is this:<br>
on the inside and the outside,<br>
be detached from body-delight. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw68' href='#vjw68'>Verse 68</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw484' href='#jw484'>Walt 484</a> Cultivate emancipation<br>
and abandon latent conceit.<br>
Then, through understanding conceit,<br>
you’ll wander in tranquility. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw69' href='#vjw69'>Verse 69</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw485' href='#jw485'>Walt 485</a> Those following the stream, excited with lust,<br>
<span class='add'>are</span> making webs for themselves, like a spider;<br>
<span class='add'>others,</span> cutting that away, are going forth,<br>
indifferent, giving up the pleasures of lust.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw70-71' href='#vjw70-71'>Verse 70-71</a></p>
.
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw486' href='#jw486'>Walt 486</a>Then the Charioteer of Men,<br>
knowing my mental readiness,<br>
in order to instruct me preached<br>
<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Mahānidānasuttanta</i>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw72' href='#vjw72'>Verse 72</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw487' href='#jw487'>Walt 487</a> Hearing that best <i lang='pli' translate='no'>suttanta</i>, I<br>
recalled <span class='add'>my</span> former memory.<br>
Just standing there I was at peace;<br>
I purified my “<i lang='pli' translate='no'>Dhamma</i> eye”. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw73' href='#vjw73'>Verse 73</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw488' href='#jw488'>Walt 488</a> Immediately falling down<br>
before the feet of the Great Sage,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>at that moment,</span><br>
to confess offenses <span class='add'>to him</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw74' href='#vjw74'>Verse 74</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw489' href='#jw489'>Walt 489</a> “Praise to you, O Seer of All!<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw490' href='#jw490'>Walt 490</a> Plunged into the thicket of views,<br>
I was doped by passionate lust.<br>
<span class='add'>I now</span> delight in discipline,<br>

do not see Great Sages like you,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw493' href='#jw493'>Walt 493</a> Beauty-obsessed, I did not go<br>

suspecting he’d be unfriendly;<br>
I am confessing that offense.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw79' href='#vjw79'>Verse 79</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw494' href='#jw494'>Walt 494</a> And then the One with Honeyed Speech,<br>
the Great Compassionate Victor<br>
sprinkling me with ambrosia said,<br>
“Khemā, you should stay <span class='add'>here with us</span>.” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw80' href='#vjw80'>Verse 80</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw495' href='#jw495'>Walt 495</a> Then after bowing down <span class='add'>my</span> head,<br>
having circumambulated,<br>
having gone, having seen the king,<br>
I spoke these words <span class='add'>to him just then</span>. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw81' href='#vjw81'>Verse 81</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw496' href='#jw496'>Walt 496</a> “O conqueror of enemies,<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw497' href='#jw497'>Walt 497</a> If it’s pleasing to you, O king,<br>
I’ll go forth in the Neutral One’s<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw498' href='#jw498'>Walt 498</a> Then pressing <span class='add'>his</span> hands together<br>
<span class='add'>the king,</span> the lord of the earth, said,<br>
“I permit you, O lucky one.<br>
Let your going forth have success!” <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw84' href='#vjw84'>Verse 84</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw499' href='#jw499'>Walt 499</a> And then after my going forth,<br>
when I had served for seven months,<br>
watching lamp <span class='add'>flames</span> rising, falling,<br>
my mind being profoundly moved, <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw85' href='#vjw85'>Verse 85</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw500' href='#jw500'>Walt 500</a> fed up with all conditioned things,<br>
skillful in the heaps of causes,<br>
passing over the four-fold flood,<br>
I attained <span class='add'>my</span> arahantship. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw86' href='#vjw86'>Verse 86</a></p>
<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw501' href='#jw501'>Walt 501</a> I’d mastered the superpower<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw502' href='#jw502'>Walt 502</a> I remember <span class='add'>my</span> former lives;<br>
<span class='add'>my</span> “divine eye” is purified.<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw503' href='#jw503'>Walt 503</a> In the Buddha’s dispensation,<br>
<span class='add'>I</span> have purified <span class='add'>my</span> knowledge<br>

<p><a class='ref jw' id='jw505' href='#jw505'>Walt 505</a> Then, being asked subtle questions<br>
in Toraṇavatthu, by the<br>
queen, wife of the Kosala <span class='add'>king,</span><br>
I explained according to truth. <a class='ref vjw' id='vjw91' href='#vjw91'>Verse 91</a></p>

Then the Buddha explained just as<br>
