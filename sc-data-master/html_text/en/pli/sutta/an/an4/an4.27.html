<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>(1) “A rag-robe is a trifle among robes, easily gained <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.ii.27' href='#an.ii.27'>an.ii.27</a> and blameless. (2) A lump of almsfood is a trifle among meals, easily gained and blameless. (3) The foot of a tree is a trifle among lodgings, easily gained and blameless. (4) Putrid urine is a trifle among medicines, easily gained and blameless.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“These are the four trifles, easily gained and blameless. When a bhikkhu is satisfied with what is trifling and easily gained, I say that he has one of the factors of the ascetic life.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>When one is content with what is blameless,<br>
trifling and easily gained;<br>
when one’s mind is not distressed<br>
because of a lodging,<br>
robe, drink, and food,<br>
one is not hindered anywhere.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>These qualities, rightly said<br>
to conform to the ascetic life,<br>
are acquired by a bhikkhu<br>
who is content and heedful.</p>
