<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Vajjis at Bhaṇḍagāma. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus!”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerable sir!” those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this: “Bhikkhus, it is because of not understanding and penetrating four things that you and I have roamed and wandered for such a long stretch of time. What four?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“It is, bhikkhus, because of not understanding and penetrating noble virtuous behavior, noble concentration, noble wisdom, and noble liberation that you and I have roamed and wandered for such a long stretch of time.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Noble virtuous behavior has been understood and penetrated. Noble concentration has been understood and penetrated. Noble wisdom has been understood and penetrated. Noble liberation has been understood and penetrated. Craving for existence has been cut off; the conduit to existence has been destroyed; now there is no more renewed existence.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.ii.2' href='#an.ii.2'>an.ii.2</a> </p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Virtuous behavior, concentration, wisdom,<br>
and unsurpassed liberation:<br>
these things the illustrious Gotama<br>
understood by himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Having directly known these things,<br>
the Buddha taught the Dhamma to the bhikkhus.<br>
The Teacher, the end-maker of suffering,<br>
the One with Vision, has attained nibbāna.”</p>
