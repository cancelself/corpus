<h1>4.23. The World</h1>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, the Tathāgata has fully awakened to the world; the Tathāgata is detached from the world. The Tathāgata has fully awakened to the origin of the world; the Tathāgata has abandoned the origin of the world. The Tathāgata has fully awakened to the cessation of the world; the Tathāgata has realized the cessation of the world. The Tathāgata has fully awakened to the way leading to the cessation of the world; the Tathāgata has developed the way leading to the cessation of the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>(1) “Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, reached, sought after, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.ii.24' href='#an.ii.24'>an.ii.24</a> examined by the mind—all that the Tathāgata has fully awakened to; therefore he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>(2) “Bhikkhus, whatever the Tathāgata speaks, utters, or expounds in the interval between the night when he awakens to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment and the night when he attains final nibbāna, all that is just so and not otherwise; therefore he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>(3) “Bhikkhus, as the Tathāgata speaks, so he does; as he does, so he speaks. Since he does as he speaks and speaks as he does, therefore he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>(4) “Bhikkhus, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, among this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, the Tathāgata is the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of mastery; therefore he is called the Tathāgata.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Having directly known all the world—<br>
all in the world just as it is—<br>
he is detached from all the world,<br>
disengaged from all the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>He is the vanquisher of all,<br>
the wise one who has untied all knots.<br>
He has reached the supreme peace,<br>
nibbāna, inaccessible to fear.</p>

he is the lion unsurpassed;<br>
in this world with its devas,<br>
he set in motion the wheel of Brahmā.</p>

who have gone for refuge to the Buddha<br>
assemble and pay homage to him,<br>
the great one free from diffidence:</p>

the great one free from diffidence.<br>
In this world together with its devas,<br>
there is no one who can rival you.</p>
