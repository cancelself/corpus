<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Giving, endearing speech,<br>
beneficent conduct, and impartiality<br>
under diverse worldly conditions,<br>
as is suitable to fit each case: these means<br>
of sustaining a favorable relationship<br>
are like the linchpin of a rolling chariot.</p>

neither mother nor father<br>

of sustaining a favorable relationship,<br>
wise people respect them;<br>
thus they attain to greatness<br>
and are highly praised. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.ii.33' href='#an.ii.33'>an.ii.33</a> </p>
