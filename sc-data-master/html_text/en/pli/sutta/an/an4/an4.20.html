<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, if an assigner of meals possesses four qualities, he is deposited in hell as if brought there. What four? He takes a wrong course because of desire, because of hatred, because of delusion, or because of fear. If an assigner of meals possesses these four qualities, he is deposited in hell as if brought there.</p>
