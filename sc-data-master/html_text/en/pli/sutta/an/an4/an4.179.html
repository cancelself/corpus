<h1>4.179. Unbinding</h1>
</header>
<p>Then Ven. Ananda went to Ven. Sariputta and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sariputta, “Friend Sariputta, what is the cause, what is the reason, why some beings do not become totally unbound in the present life?”</p>
<p>“There’s the case, friend Ananda, where beings do not discern, as it actually is present, that ‘This perception has a share in decline’; ‘This perception has a share in stability’; ‘This perception has a share in distinction’; ‘This perception has a share in penetration.’ This is the cause, this is the reason, why some beings do not become totally unbound in the present life.”</p>
<p>“And what, friend Sariputta, is the cause, what is the reason, why some beings do become totally unbound in the present life?”</p>
