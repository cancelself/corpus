When a bhikkhu is perplexed about the Teacher, doubts him, is not convinced about him and does not place confidence in him, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor … <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.18' href='#an.v.18'>an.v.18</a> … and striving, this is the first kind of mental barrenness that he has not abandoned.</p>

When a bhikkhu is irritated by his fellow monks, displeased with them, aggressive toward them, ill disposed toward them, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving.

When a bhikkhu is not devoid of lust for sensual pleasures, not devoid of desire, affection, thirst, passion, and craving for them, his mind does not incline to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving. Since his mind does not incline to ardor … and striving, this is the first bondage of the mind that he has not eradicated.</p>

Having eaten as much as he wants until his belly is full, he is intent upon the pleasure of rest, the pleasure of sloth, the pleasure of sleep … he lives the spiritual life aspiring for <span class='add'>rebirth in</span> a certain order of devas, <span class='add'>thinking</span>: ‘By this virtuous behavior, observance, austerity, or spiritual life I will be a deva or one <span class='add'>in the retinue</span> of the devas.’ When he lives the spiritual life aspiring for <span class='add'>rebirth in</span> a certain order of devas … his mind does not incline <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.19' href='#an.v.19'>an.v.19</a> to ardor, effort, perseverance, and striving.
