<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhante, how many qualities should a bhikkhu possess to give full ordination?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“A bhikkhu who possesses ten qualities, Upāli, may give full ordination. What ten? (1) Here, a bhikkhu is virtuous … he trains in them. (2) He has learned much … and penetrated well by view. (3) Both Pātimokkhas have been well transmitted to him in detail, well analyzed, well mastered, well determined in terms of the rules and their detailed explication. (4) He is able to look after a patient or to get someone else to look after him. (5) He is able to eliminate one’s dissatisfaction or to get someone else to eliminate it. (6) He is able to use the Dhamma to dispel regrets that might arise <span class='add'>in his pupils</span>. (7) He is able to dissuade them, by way of the Dhamma, from erroneous views that have arisen. (8) He is able to encourage them in the higher virtuous behavior. (9) He is able to encourage them in the higher mind. (10) He is able to encourage them in the higher wisdom. A bhikkhu who possesses these ten qualities may give full ordination.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.73' href='#an.v.73'>an.v.73</a> </p>
