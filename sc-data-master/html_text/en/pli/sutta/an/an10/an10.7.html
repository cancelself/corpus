<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Friend Sāriputta, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.9' href='#an.v.9'>an.v.9</a> (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient?”</p>
<p>“He could, friend Ānanda.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“But how, friend Sāriputta, could he obtain such a state of concentration?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“On one occasion, friend Ānanda, I was dwelling right here in Sāvatthī in the Blind Men’s Grove. There I attained such a state of concentration that I was not percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but I was still percipient.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“But of what was the Venerable Sāriputta percipient on that occasion?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“One perception arose and another perception ceased in me: ‘The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.’ Just as, when a fire of twigs is burning, one flame arises and another flame ceases, so one perception <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.10' href='#an.v.10'>an.v.10</a> arose and another perception ceased in me: ‘The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.’ On that occasion, friend, I was percipient: ‘The cessation of existence is nibbāna.’”</p>
