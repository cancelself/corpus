<h1>10.103. Wrongness</h1>
</header>
<p>“From wrongness comes failure, not success. And how is it, monks, that from wrongness comes failure, not success?</p>
<p>“In a person of wrong view, wrong resolve comes into being. In a person of wrong resolve, wrong speech. In a person of wrong speech, wrong action. In a person of wrong action, wrong livelihood. In a person of wrong livelihood, wrong effort. In a person of wrong effort, wrong mindfulness. In a person of wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration. In a person of wrong concentration, wrong knowledge. In a person of wrong knowledge, wrong release.</p>
<p>“This is how from wrongness comes failure, not success.</p>
