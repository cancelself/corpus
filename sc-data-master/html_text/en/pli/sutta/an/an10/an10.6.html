<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Bhante, could a bhikkhu obtain such a state of concentration that (1) he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; (2) of water in relation to water; (3) of fire in relation to fire; (4) of air in relation to air; (5) of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; (6) of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; (7) of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; (8) of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; (9) of this world in relation to this world; (10) of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient?”</p>
<p>“He could, Ānanda.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“But how, Bhante, could he obtain such a state of concentration?” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.8' href='#an.v.8'>an.v.8</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Here, Ānanda, a bhikkhu is percipient thus: ‘This is peaceful, this is sublime, that is, the stilling of all activities, the relinquishing of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, nibbāna.’ It is in this way, Ānanda, that a bhikkhu could obtain such a state of concentration that he would not be percipient of earth in relation to earth; of water in relation to water; of fire in relation to fire; of air in relation to air; of the base of the infinity of space in relation to the base of the infinity of space; of the base of the infinity of consciousness in relation to the base of the infinity of consciousness; of the base of nothingness in relation to the base of nothingness; of the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception in relation to the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception; of this world in relation to this world; of the other world in relation to the other world, but he would still be percipient.”</p>
