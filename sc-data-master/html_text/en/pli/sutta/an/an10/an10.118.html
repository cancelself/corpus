<h1>10.118. The Near Shore</h1>
</header>
<p>“Monks, I shall point out the nearest shore and the farthest shore. Hear this, and thoroughly attend to it in mind. I shall speak.”</p>
<p>“Just so, Venerable One,” the monks assented to the Blessed One.</p>
<p>“What, monks, is the nearest shore; what is the farthest shore?</p>
<p>“Wrong view is the nearest shore; right view is the farthest shore;</p>
<p>“Wrong intention is the nearest shore; right intention is the farthest shore;<br>
wrong speech is the nearest shore; right speech is the farthest shore;<br>
wrong conduct is the nearest shore; right conduct is the farthest shore;<br>
wrong livelihood is the nearest shore; right livelihood is the farthest shore;<br>
wrong effort is the nearest shore; right effort is the farthest shore;<br>
wrong mindfulness is the nearest shore; right mindfulness is the farthest shore;<br>
wrong concentration is the nearest shore; right concentration is the farthest shore;<br>
wrong knowledge is the nearest shore; right knowledge is the farthest shore;<br>
wrong liberation is the nearest shore; right liberation is the farthest shore.</p>
<p>“This, monks, is the nearest shore; this is the farthest shore.</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Amongst humans, very few are they,<br>
those mortals going to the farthest shore;<br>
Rather, the rest of humankind<br>
runs just along this shore.</p>
<p>Those who, indeed, practise in the Dhamma,<br>
in the well-taught Dhamma,<br>
They are mortals who will go beyond<br>
the sway of death, so difficult to escape.</p>
<p>Renouncing the dark qualities,<br>
the wise person should cultivate the bright;<br>
From home, having come to homelessness,<br>
in seclusion, where delight is difficult,</p>
<p>One should wish to feel delight there,<br>
having destroyed sensuality, a person of nothing.<br>
The wise person should purify himself<br>
from the defilements of the mind.</p>
<p>Those with mind rightly well-cultivated<br>
in the qualities of perfect awakening,<br>
Who, in the giving-up of grasping,<br>
without clinging, are delighted,<br>
The brilliant ones, with unconscious influences withered away,<br>
they, in the world, are completely unbound.”</p>
