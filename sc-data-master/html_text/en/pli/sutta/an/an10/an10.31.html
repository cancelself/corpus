<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Then the Venerable Upāli approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Bhante, on how many grounds has the Tathāgata prescribed the training rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“It is, Upāli, on ten grounds that the Tathāgata has prescribed the training rules for his disciples and recited the Pātimokkha. What ten? (1) For the well-being of the Saṅgha; (2) for the ease of the Saṅgha; (3) for keeping recalcitrant persons in check; (4) so that well-behaved bhikkhus can dwell at ease; (5) for the restraint of taints pertaining to this present life; (6) for the dispelling of taints pertaining to future lives; (7) so that those without confidence might gain confidence; and (8) for increasing <span class='add'>the confidence</span> of those with confidence; (9) for the continuation of the good Dhamma; and (10) for promoting discipline.</p>
