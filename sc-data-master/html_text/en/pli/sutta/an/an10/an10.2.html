<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>(1)–(2) “Bhikkhus, for a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous, no volition need be exerted: ‘Let non-regret arise in me.’ It is natural that non-regret arises in a virtuous person, one whose behavior is virtuous.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>(3) “For one without regret no volition need be exerted: ‘Let joy arise in me.’ It is natural that joy arises in one without regret.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>(4) “For one who is joyful no volition need be exerted: ‘Let rapture arise in me.’ It is natural that rapture arises in one who is joyful. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.3' href='#an.v.3'>an.v.3</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>(5) “For one with a rapturous mind no volition need be exerted: ‘Let my body be tranquil.’ It is natural that the body of one with a rapturous mind is tranquil.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>(6) “For one tranquil in body no volition need be exerted: ‘Let me feel pleasure.’ It is natural that one tranquil in body feels pleasure.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>(7) “For one feeling pleasure no volition need be exerted: ‘Let my mind be concentrated.’ It is natural that the mind of one feeling pleasure is concentrated.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>(8) “For one who is concentrated no volition need be exerted: ‘Let me know and see things as they really are.’ It is natural that one who is concentrated knows and sees things as they really are.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>(9) “For one who knows and sees things as they really are no volition need be exerted: ‘Let me be disenchanted and dispassionate.’ It is natural that one who knows and sees things as they really are is disenchanted and dispassionate.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>(10) “For one who is disenchanted and dispassionate no volition need be exerted: ‘Let me realize the knowledge and vision of liberation.’ It is natural that one who is disenchanted and dispassionate realizes the knowledge and vision of liberation.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Thus, bhikkhus, (9)–(10) the knowledge and vision of liberation is the purpose and benefit of disenchantment and dispassion; (8) disenchantment and dispassion are the purpose and benefit of the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; (7) the knowledge and vision of things as they really are is the purpose and benefit of concentration; (6) concentration is the purpose and benefit of pleasure; (5) pleasure is the purpose and benefit of tranquility; (4) tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture; (3) rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy; (2) joy is the purpose and benefit of non-regret; and (1) non-regret is the purpose and benefit of virtuous behavior.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Thus, bhikkhus, one stage <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.v.4' href='#an.v.4'>an.v.4</a> flows into the next stage, one stage fills up the next stage, for going from the near shore to the far shore.”</p>
