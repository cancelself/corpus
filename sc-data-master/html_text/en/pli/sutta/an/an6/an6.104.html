<h1>6.104. Without Exception (3)</h1>
</header>
<p>“In seeing six rewards, it’s enough motivation for a monk to establish the perception of not-self with regard to all phenomena without exception. Which six? ‘I won’t be fashioned in connection with any world. My I-making will be stopped. My my-making will be stopped. I’ll be endowed with uncommon knowledge. I’ll become one who rightly sees cause, along with causally-originated phenomena.’</p>
