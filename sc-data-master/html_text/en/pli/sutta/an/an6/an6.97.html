<h1>6.97. Rewards</h1>
</header>
<p>“Monks, there are these six rewards in realizing the fruit of stream-entry. Which six? One is certain of the true Dhamma. One is not subject to falling back. There is no suffering over what has had a limit placed on it. One is endowed with uncommon knowledge. One rightly sees cause, along with causally-originated phenomena.</p>
<p>“These are the six rewards in realizing the fruit of stream-entry.”</p>
