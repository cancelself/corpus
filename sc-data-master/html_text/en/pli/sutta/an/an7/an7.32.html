<h1>7.32. Heedfulness</h1>
</header>
<p>Then a certain devata, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, she stood to one side. As she was standing there, she said to the Blessed One, “These seven qualities, lord, lead to a monk’s non-decline. Which seven? Respect for the teacher, respect for the Dhamma, respect for the Sangha, respect for training, respect for concentration, respect for heedfulness, respect for hospitality. These seven qualities, lord, lead to the non-decline of a monk.”</p>
<p>That is what the devata said. The Teacher approved. Sensing, “The Teacher approves of me,” the devata bowed down to the Blessed One and, circled him three times, keeping him to his right, and then disappeared right there.</p>
<p>Then when the night had past, The Blessed One addressed the monks: “Last night, monks, a certain devata in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta’s Grove, came to me and, on arrival, bowed down to me and stood to one side. As she was standing there, she said to me, ‘These seven qualities, lord, lead to a monk’s non-decline. Which seven? Respect for the teacher, respect for the Dhamma, respect for the Sangha, respect for training, respect for concentration, respect for heedfulness, respect for hospitality. These seven qualities, lord, lead to the non-decline of a monk.’</p>
<p>“That is what that devata said. Having said it, she bowed down to me, circled me three times, and then disappeared right there.”</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>Respecting the Teacher<br>
respecting the Dhamma,<br>
and with fierce respect for the Sangha,<br>
respecting concentration, ardent,<br>
and with fierce respect for training,<br>
a monk respecting heedfulness,<br>
and with respect for hospitality<br>
—incapable of decline—<br>
is right in the presence of unbinding.</p>
