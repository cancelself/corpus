<h1>5.255. Stinginess</h1>
</header>
<p>“With the abandoning and eradication of the five forms of stinginess, the holy life is fulfilled. Which five?</p>
<p>“With the abandoning and eradication of stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings], the holy life is fulfilled. With the abandoning and eradication of stinginess as to one’s family [of supporters] … stinginess as to one’s gains … stinginess as to one’s status … stinginess as to the Dhamma, the holy life is fulfilled.</p>
<p>“With the abandoning and eradication of these five forms of stinginess, the holy life is fulfilled.”</p>
