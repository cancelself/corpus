Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. <span class='add'>Now on that occasion Queen Mallikā had just died.</span> Then a man approached King Pasendi and whispered in his ear: “Sire, Queen Mallikā has just died.” When this was said, King Pasenadi was pained and saddened, and he sat there with slumping shoulders, facing downward, glum, and speechless.</p>
