<h1>5.199. A Family</h1>
</header>
<p>“On the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family, there the people give rise to a great deal of merit by five means. Which five?</p>
<p>“On the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family, the minds of the people, on seeing him, are brightened. On that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to heaven.</p>
<p>“On the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family, the people rise up to greet him, bow down, give him/her a seat. On that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to birth in a high family.</p>
<p>“On the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family, the people dispel their stinginess. On that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to great influence.</p>
<p>“On the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family, the people share with him/her in line with their ability, in line with their strength. On that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to great wealth.</p>
<p>“On the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family, the people inquire, ask questions, listen to the Dhamma. On that occasion the family is practicing the practice leading to great discernment.</p>
<p>“On the occasion when a virtuous person who has gone forth approaches a family, there the people give rise to a great deal of merit by these five means.”</p>
