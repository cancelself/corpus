</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Monks, there are five things that should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic. What five?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“‘I am subject to decay; I am not exempt from decay.’ This should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“‘I am subject to sickness; I am not exempt from sickness.’ This should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“‘I am subject to dieing; I am not exempt from dieing.’ This should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“‘Everything that is beloved and pleasing will change and be separated from me.’ This should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“‘I am the owner of my karma, the recipient of my karma, born from my karma, bound to my karma, inseparable from my karma. Any action that I do – whether it is good or evil – I will receive its result.’ This should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Monks, for what benefit should ‘I am subject to decay; I am not exempt from decay’ be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic? Monks, there are beings who are intoxicated with youth. Because of that intoxication, they engage in physical misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. When they frequently contemplate this, that intoxication with youth is either completely abandoned or diminished. Monks, it is for this benefit that ‘I am subject to decay; I am not exempt from decay’ should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Monks, for what benefit should ‘I am subject to sickness; I am not exempt from sickness’ be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic? Monks, there are beings who are intoxicated with health. Because of that intoxication, they engage in physical misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. When they frequently contemplate this, that intoxication with health is either completely abandoned or diminished. Monks, it is for this benefit that ‘I am subject to sickness; I am not exempt from sickness’ should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Monks, for what benefit should ‘I am subject to dieing; I am not exempt from dieing’ be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic? Monks, there are beings who are intoxicated with life. Because of that intoxication, they engage in physical misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. When they frequently contemplate this, that intoxication with life is either completely abandoned or diminished. Monks, it is for this benefit that ‘I am subject to dieing; I am not exempt from dieing’ should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Monks, for what benefit should ‘Everything that is beloved and pleasing will change and be separated from me’ be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic? Monks, there are beings who have interest and passion for things that are beloved and pleasing. Because of that passion, they engage in physical misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct. When they frequently contemplate this, that interest and passion for things that are beloved and pleasing is either completely abandoned or diminished. Monks, it is for this benefit that ‘Everything that is beloved and pleasing will change and be separated from me’ should be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Monks, for what benefit should ‘I am the owner of my karma, the recipient of my karma, born from my karma, bound to my karma, inseparable from my karma. Any action that I do – whether it is good or evil – I will receive its result’ be frequently contemplated, whether one is a woman or a man, a layperson or a monastic? Monks, there are beings who have committed physical misconduct, verbal misconduct, or mental misconduct.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Monks, a disciple of the noble ones considers this: ‘It is not just me that is subject to decay and not exempt from decay. All beings that come and go, die and reappear, are subject to decay and are not exempt from decay.’ When one frequently contemplates this, the path is produced. One practices that path, develops it, and commits to it. When one practices that path, develops it, and commits to it, the fetters are completely abandoned and the underlying tendencies are destroyed.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Monks, a disciple of the noble ones considers this: ‘It is not just me that is the owner of my karma, the recipient of my karma, born from my karma, bound to my karma, inseparable from my karma, and that receives the result of any action I do – whether it is good or evil.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Subject to sickness, subject to decay, and subject to dieing;<br>
This is the nature of beings, which ordinary people despise.</p>

I knew intoxication with health, youth, and life.</p>

I made an effort, and saw Nibbāna.</p>

I will not return – I have completed the spiritual life.”</p>
