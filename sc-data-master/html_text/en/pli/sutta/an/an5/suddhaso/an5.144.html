<h1 class='sutta-title'>5.144. The Discourse at Tikaṇḍakī</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāketa, in Tikaṇḍakī<sup>1</sup> Grove. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!” “Auspicious sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Monks, from time to time it is good for a monk to dwell perceiving the non-repulsive as repulsive. Monks, from time to time it is good for a monk to dwell perceiving the repulsive as non-repulsive. Monks, from time to time it is good for a monk to dwell perceiving both non-repulsive and repulsive as repulsive. Monks, from time to time it is good for a monk to dwell perceiving both repulsive and non-repulsive as non-repulsive. Monks, from time to time it is good for a monk to circumvent both repulsive and non-repulsive and dwell equanimous, mindful, and clearly aware.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monks, for what benefit would a monk dwell perceiving the non-repulsive as repulsive? <span class='add'>Thinking</span> ‘May lust<sup>2</sup> not arise in me about lust-inducing things.’ Monks, this is the benefit for which a monk would dwell perceiving the non-repulsive as repulsive.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Monks, for what benefit would a monk dwell perceiving the repulsive as non-repulsive? <span class='add'>Thinking</span> ‘May hate not arise in me about hate-inducing things.’ Monks, this is the benefit for which a monk would dwell perceiving the repulsive as non-repulsive.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Monks, for what benefit would a monk dwell perceiving both non-repulsive and repulsive as repulsive? <span class='add'>Thinking</span> ‘May lust not arise in me about lust-inducing things.’ Monks, this is the benefit for which a monk would dwell perceiving both non-repulsive and repulsive as repulsive.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Monks, for what benefit would a monk dwell perceiving both repulsive and non-repulsive as non-repulsive? <span class='add'>Thinking</span> ‘May hate not arise in me about hate-inducing things.’ Monks, this is the benefit for which a monk would dwell perceiving both repulsive and non-repulsive as non-repulsive.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Monks, for what benefit would a monk circumvent both repulsive and non-repulsive and dwell equanimous, mindful, and clearly aware? <span class='add'>Thinking</span> ‘Being mindful and clearly aware, may no lust at all ever arise in me about lust-inducing things, may no hate at all ever arise in me about hate-inducing things, may no delusion at all ever arise in me about delusion-inducing things.’ Monks, this is the benefit for which a monk would circumvent both repulsive and non-repulsive and dwell equanimous, mindful, and clearly aware.”</p>
