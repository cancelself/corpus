<h1>5.7. Sensual Pleasures</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, beings for the most part are captivated by sensual pleasures. When a clansman has forsaken the sickle and carrying-pole and gone forth from the household life into homelessness, he can be described as a clansman who has gone forth out of faith. For what reason? Sensual pleasures, whether of this or that kind, can be obtained by a youth. Inferior sensual pleasures, middling sensual pleasures, and superior sensual pleasures are all reckoned simply as sensual pleasures. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.iii.6' href='#an.iii.6'>an.iii.6</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Suppose a young infant boy, ignorant, lying on his back, were to put a stick or pebble in his mouth because of his nurse’s heedlessness. His nurse would quickly attend to him and try to take it out. If she could not quickly take it out, she would brace the boy’s head with her left hand and, hooking a finger of her right hand, she would take it out even if she had to draw blood. For what reason? There would be some distress for the boy—this I don’t deny—but the nurse has to do so for his good and welfare, out of compassion for him. However, when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, the nurse would be unconcerned about him, thinking: ‘The boy can now look after himself. He won’t be heedless.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“So too, so long as a bhikkhu is still not accomplished in faith in <span class='add'>cultivating</span> wholesome qualities, in a sense of shame in <span class='add'>cultivating</span> wholesome qualities, in moral dread in <span class='add'>cultivating</span> wholesome qualities, in energy in <span class='add'>cultivating</span> wholesome qualities, and in wisdom in <span class='add'>cultivating</span> wholesome qualities, I must still look after him. But when that bhikkhu is accomplished in faith in <span class='add'>cultivating</span> wholesome qualities … accomplished in wisdom in <span class='add'>cultivating</span> wholesome qualities, then I am unconcerned about him, thinking: ‘The bhikkhu can now look after himself. He won’t be heedless.’”</p>
