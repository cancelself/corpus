<h1>5.202. Listening to the Dhamma</h1>
</header>
<p>“There are these five rewards in listening to the Dhamma. Which five?</p>
<p>“One hears what one has not heard before. One clarifies what one has heard before. One gets rid of doubt. One’s views are made straight. One’s mind grows serene.</p>
<p>“These are the five rewards in listening to the Dhamma.”</p>
