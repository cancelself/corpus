What five? Here, a bhikkhu is devoid of faith, morally shameless, morally reckless, lazy, and unwise. Possessing these five qualities, a bhikkhu dwells in suffering in this very life—with distress, anguish, and fever—and with the breakup of the body, after death, he can expect a bad destination.</p>
