<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One…. The Blessed One then said to him: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.iv.224' href='#an.iv.224'>an.iv.224</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Sāriputta, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, how many powers does he possess by reason of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Bhante, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, he possesses eight powers by reason of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’ What eight?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>(1) “Here, Bhante, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen all conditioned phenomena as they really are with correct wisdom as impermanent. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>(2) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has clearly seen sensual pleasures as they really are with correct wisdom as similar to a charcoal pit. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed….</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>(3) “Again, the mind of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion; it is withdrawn, delighting in renunciation, and is entirely finished with all things that are a basis for the taints. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed….</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>(4) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four establishments of mindfulness. Since <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.iv.225' href='#an.iv.225'>an.iv.225</a> that is so, this is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed….</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>(5)–(8) “Again, a bhikkhu with taints destroyed has developed and well developed the four bases for psychic potency … the five spiritual faculties … the seven factors of enlightenment … the noble eightfold path. This is a power of a bhikkhu with taints destroyed on the basis of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Bhante, when a bhikkhu’s taints have been destroyed, he possesses these eight powers on the basis of which he can claim: ‘My taints have been destroyed.’”</p>
