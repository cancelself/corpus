What eight? <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.iv.157' href='#an.iv.157'>an.iv.157</a> Gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.

blame and praise, pleasure and pain:<br>
these conditions that people meet<br>
are impermanent, transient, and subject to change.</p>

they are gone and no longer present.<br>
Having known the dustless, sorrowless state,<br>
he understands rightly and has transcended existence.</p>
