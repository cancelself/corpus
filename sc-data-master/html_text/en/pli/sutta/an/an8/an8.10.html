<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Campā on a bank of the Gaggārā Lotus Pond. Now on that occasion bhikkhus were reproving a bhikkhu for an offense. When being reproved, that bhikkhu answered evasively, diverted the discussion to an irrelevant subject, and displayed anger, hatred, and resentment. Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.iv.169' href='#an.iv.169'>an.iv.169</a> “Bhikkhus, eject this person! Bhikkhus, eject this person! This person should be banished. Why should another’s son vex you?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Here, bhikkhus, so long as the bhikkhus do not see his offense, a certain person has the same manner (1) of going forward and (2) returning, (3) of looking ahead and (4) looking aside, (5) of bending and (6) stretching his limbs, and (7) of wearing his robes and (8) carrying his outer robe and bowl as the good bhikkhus. When, however, they see his offense, they know him as a corruption among ascetics, just chaff and trash among ascetics. Then they expel him. For what reason? So that he doesn’t corrupt the good bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Suppose that when a field of barley is growing, some blighted barley would appear that would be just chaff and trash among the barley. As long as its head has not come forth, its roots would be just like those of the other <span class='add'>crops</span>, the good barley; its stem would be just like that of the other <span class='add'>crops</span>, the good barley; its leaves would be just like those of the other <span class='add'>crops</span>, the good barley. When, however, its head comes forth, they know it as blighted barley, just chaff <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.iv.170' href='#an.iv.170'>an.iv.170</a> and trash among the barley. Then they pull it up by the root and cast it out from the barley field. For what reason? So that it doesn’t spoil the good barley.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“So too, so long as the bhikkhus do not see his offense, a certain person here has the same manner of going forward … and carrying his outer robe and bowl as the good bhikkhus. When, however, they see his offense, they know him as a corruption among ascetics, just chaff and trash among ascetics. Then they expel him. For what reason? So that he doesn’t corrupt the good bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Suppose that when a large heap of grain is being winnowed, the grains that are firm and pithy form a pile on one side, and the wind blows the spoiled grains and chaff to another side. Then the owners take a broom and sweep them even further away. For what reason? So that they don’t spoil the good grain.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“So too, so long as the bhikkhus do not see his offense, a certain person here has the same manner of going forward … and carrying his outer robe and bowl as the others, the good bhikkhus. When, however, the bhikkhus see his offense, they know him as <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.iv.171' href='#an.iv.171'>an.iv.171</a> a corruption among ascetics, just chaff and trash among ascetics. Then they expel him. For what reason? So that he doesn’t corrupt the good bhikkhus.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Suppose a man needs a gutter for a well. He would take a sharp axe and enter the woods. He would strike a number of trees with the blade of his axe. When so struck, the firm and pithy trees would give off a dull sound, but those that are inwardly rotten, corrupt, and decayed would give off a hollow sound. The man would cut this tree down at its foot, cut off the crown, thoroughly clean it out, and use it as a gutter for a well.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“So too, bhikkhus, so long as the bhikkhus do not see his offense, a certain person here has the same manner of going forward and returning, of looking ahead and looking aside, of bending and stretching his limbs, of wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl, as the good bhikkhus. When, however, the bhikkhus see his offense, they know him as a corruption among ascetics, just chaff and trash among ascetics. Then they expel him. For what reason? So that he doesn’t corrupt the good bhikkhus.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.iv.172' href='#an.iv.172'>an.iv.172</a> </p>
