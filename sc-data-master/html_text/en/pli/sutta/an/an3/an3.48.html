<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>“Bhikkhus, based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in three ways. What three? (1) They grow in branches, leaves, and foliage; (2) they grow in bark and shoots; and (3) they grow in softwood and heartwood. Based on the Himalayas, the king of mountains, great sal trees grow in these three ways.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“So too, when the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in three ways. What three? (1) They grow in faith; (2) they grow in virtuous behavior; and (3) they grow in wisdom. When the head of a family is endowed with faith, the people in the family who depend on him grow in these three ways.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Just as the trees that grow<br>
in dependence on a rocky mountain<br>
in a vast forest wilderness<br>
might become great “woodland lords,”<br>
so, when the head of a family here<br>
possesses faith and virtue,<br>
his wife, children, and relatives<br>
all grow in dependence upon him;<br>
so too his friends, his family circle,<br>
and those dependent on him. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.i.153' href='#an.i.153'>an.i.153</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Those possessed of discernment,<br>
seeing that virtuous man’s good conduct,<br>
his generosity and good deeds,<br>
emulate his example.</p>

the path leading to a good destination,<br>
those who desire sensual pleasures rejoice,<br>
delighting in the deva world.</p>
