<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī approached the Blessed One … and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Master Gotama, whoever has a sacrifice, a memorial meal, an offering dish, or something to be given should give the gift to brahmins who are masters of the threefold knowledge.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><span class='speaker'>The Blessed One said:</span> “But how, brahmin, do the brahmins describe a brahmin who is a master of the threefold knowledge?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Here, Master Gotama, a brahmin is well born on both sides … <span class='pe'>as in 3:58</span> … and <span class='add'>skilled</span> in the marks of a great man. It is in this way that the brahmins describe a master of the threefold knowledge.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Brahmin, a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline is quite different from the one that the brahmins describe.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“But in what way, Master Gotama, is one a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline? It would be good if Master Gotama would teach me the Dhamma in such a way as to make clear how one is a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Well then, brahmin, listen and attend closely. I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Yes, sir,” the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Here, brahmin, secluded from sensual pleasures … <span class='pe'>all as in 3:58, down to:</span> <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.i.167' href='#an.i.167'>an.i.167</a> … This is the third true knowledge attained by him. Ignorance is dispelled, true knowledge has arisen; darkness is dispelled, light has arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute.</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“One consummate in virtue and observances,<br>
who is resolute and composed,<br>
whose mind has been mastered,<br>
one-pointed and well concentrated;</p>

who sees heaven and the plane of misery,<br>

is a sage consummate in direct knowledge. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='an.i.168' href='#an.i.168'>an.i.168</a> </p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Through these three kinds of knowledge<br>
one is a triple-knowledge brahmin.<br>
I call him a triple-knowledge master,<br>
not the other who utters incantations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“It is in this way, brahmin, that one is a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“A master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline, Master Gotama, is quite different from a master of the threefold knowledge according to the brahmins. And a master of the threefold knowledge according to the brahmins is not worth a sixteenth part of a master of the threefold knowledge in the Noble One’s discipline.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Excellent, Master Gotama! … Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
