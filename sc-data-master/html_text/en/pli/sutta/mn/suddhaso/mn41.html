<h1 class='sutta-title'>41. The Discourse to the Residents of Sālā</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Prosperous One was traveling among the Kosalans, together with a large group of monks. He came to a brahmin village of Kosala, named Sālā. The brahmin householders of Sālā heard, “Apparently the contemplative Gotama, a child of the Sakyan clan who became a renunciant, is traveling among the Kosalans together with a large group of monks, and has arrived at Sālā. A good rumor has been circulated about that honorable Gotama: ‘The Prosperous One is a Worthy One, a Rightly Self-Awakened One; he has perfect knowledge and behavior; he is a Sublime One, a world-knower, an unsurpassed trainer of trainable people, a teacher of angels and humans, an Awakened One, a Prosperous One. He makes known this world with its angels, demons, divinities, contemplatives, priests, its celestial beings and its human beings, having personally realized it with his own superior knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in its conclusion, with the right meaning and phrasing. He demonstrates a spiritual life that is completely thorough and completely pure.’ It is good to see such Worthy Ones.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then the brahmin householders of Sālā approached the Prosperous One. Some paid respects to the Prosperous One and sat to one side; some conversed with him and sat to one side when the appropriate polite conversation was finished; some held up their hands in <i lang='pli' translate='no'>añjali</i> and sat to one side; some announced their name and clan and sat to one side; and some remained silent and sat to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When they were seated to one side, the brahmin householders of Sālā said to the Prosperous One, “Sir Gotama, what is the reason, what is the condition, because of which, when some beings are separated from their bodies after death, they reappear in a state of deprivation, a bad destination, downfall, hell? Sir Gotama, what is the reason, what is the condition, because of which, when some beings are separated from their bodies after death, they reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Householders, it is because of behavior contrary to Dhamma, behavior contrary to peace, that when some beings are separated from their bodies after death, they reappear in a state of deprivation, a bad destination, downfall, hell. Householders, it is because of behavior consistent with Dhamma, behavior consistent with peace, that when some beings are separated from their bodies after death, they reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“We do not understand the full meaning of Sir Gotama‘s brief statement, that was spoken without an explanation of its full meaning. It would be good if Sir Gotama taught us the Dhamma, such that we might understand the full meaning of Sir Gotama‘s brief statement that was spoken without an explanation of its full meaning.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Therefore, householders, listen well, and pay attention. I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Yes, sir,” the brahmin householders of Sālā replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<h2 class='add'>Causes for Rebirth in Hell</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Householders, there are three kinds of physical behavior that are contrary to Dhamma and contrary to peace. There are four kinds of verbal behavior that are contrary to Dhamma and contrary to peace. There are three kinds of mental behavior that are contrary to Dhamma and contrary to peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Householders, what are the three kinds of physical behavior that are contrary to Dhamma and contrary to peace?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Here, householders, someone is a killer, violent, bloody-handed, settled in harming and killing, merciless towards living beings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“One is a taker of what is not given; one steals what belongs to others, whether in a village or a wilderness, when it has not been given to them.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“One is a performer of sexual misconduct; one engages in sexual activity with those who are protected by mother, father, parents, brother, sister, relative, family, Dhamma, spouse, law, or betrothal.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“Here, householders, someone is a liar. When one is brought to an assembly, a forum, a group of relatives, a group of businesspeople, or to a royal family, and is asked about what one has seen: ‘Come, person, say what you know,’ when one does not know one says ‘I know,’ and when one knows one says ‘I do not know,’ when one does not see one says ‘I see,’ when one sees one says ‘I do not see.’ Thus for one‘s own sake, or for another‘s sake, or for the sake of a little bit of profit, one knowingly speaks falsely.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“One is a speaker of divisive speech. What one has heard here one reports over there in order to create division, and what one has heard over there one reports over here in order to create division. Thus one separates those who are united, worsens divisions, enjoys conflict, likes conflict, delights in conflict, and speaks in ways that create conflict.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“One is a speaker of harsh speech. Speech which is sharp, rough, hurtful, abusive, angry, and contributes to distraction<sup>1</sup> – this is the kind of speech which one speaks.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“One is a speaker of useless speech. One speaks at the wrong time; one speaks untruthfully; one speaks unbeneficially; one says things that are not Dhamma; one says things that are not Vinaya. One says things that are not worth treasuring, at the wrong time, unreasonably, immoderately, without any connection to the goal.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“One has an aversive mind with hostile thoughts, such as ‘May these beings be killed or injured or maimed or lost! They should not exist!’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“One has wrong beliefs and distorted perspectives, such as: ‘There is no gift, no offering, no donation. There is no result or consequence of good deeds or bad deeds. There is no world other than this one. There is no mother and no father. There are no beings who appear without undergoing birth. There are no contemplatives or priests in this world who are on the right path and are practicing correctly, such that they explain both this world and other worlds based on their own direct knowledge.’</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc44' href='#sc44'>SC 44</a>“Householders, if one who behaves consistent with Dhamma and consistent with peace wishes, ‘When I am separated from my body after death, may I reappear as a wealthy brahmin… a wealthy householder… an angel of the Four Great Kings… an angel of the Thirty-Three… a Yāma<sup>2</sup> angel… an angel of Contentment… an angel of Delight in Creating… an angel of Controlling Other‘s Creations… a Brahma angel… an angel of Luminosity… an angel of Limited Luminosity… an angel of Immeasurable Luminosity… an angel of Luminous Motion… an angel of Limited Radiance… an angel of Immeasurable Radiance… an angel of Radiant Suffusion… an angel of Abundant Fruit… an angel of Aviha… an angel of Atappa… an angel of Sudassa… an angel of Sudassi… an angel of Akaniṭṭha… an angel of the dimension of infinite space… an angel of the dimension of infinite consciousness… an angel of the dimension of nothingness… an angel of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception,’ then it is possible that when they are separated from their body after death, they may reappear as an angel of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a>When this was said, the brahmin householders of Sālā said to the Prosperous One, “Magnificent, Sir Gotama, magnificent, Sir Gotama! Sir Gotama, just like one might set upright what was upside down, or reveal what was hidden, or explain the path to one who is confused, or bring an oil lamp into darkness so those with eyes can see, in the same way the Dhamma has been revealed in many ways by Sir Gotama. We go to Sir Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to the monastic community. May Sir Gotama remember us as lay devotees who today have taken refuge for the rest of their lives.”</p>
