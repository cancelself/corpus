<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, at Jeta‘s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. On that occasion there was a monk named Ariṭṭha, who had previously been a vulture-trapper, and in whom a harmful opinion had arisen to this effect: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.” Many monks heard, “Apparently there is a monk named Ariṭṭha, who was previously a vulture-trapper, and in whom a harmful opinion has arisen to this effect: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then those monks approached Venerable Ariṭṭha and said to him, “Venerable Ariṭṭha, is it true that a harmful opinion that arisen in you to this effect: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Yes, Venerables. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then those monks, wishing to separate the monk Ariṭṭha from that harmful opinion, enjoined, pressured, and entreated him: “Venerable Ariṭṭha, do not speak in that way, do not slander the Blessed One; it is not good to slander the Blessed One, it is not good to speak about the Blessed One in that way. Venerable Ariṭṭha, in many ways obstructive things have been spoken about by the Blessed One as obstructive. They are obstructive for one who indulges in them. Sensuality has been spoken about by the Blessed One as bringing little gratification, much suffering, and much anguish; the drawback here is greater <span class='add'>than the gratification</span>. Sensuality has been spoken about by the Blessed One using the simile of the skeleton… the simile of the piece of meat… the simile of the charcoal pit… the simile of the dream… the simile of the borrower… the simile of the tree-fruit… the simile of the chopping-block… the simile of the spear… the simile of the serpent‘s head. It brings much suffering and much anguish; the drawback here is greater <span class='add'>than the gratification</span>.” But although the monk Ariṭṭha was enjoined, pressured, and entreated in this way by those monks, he still stubbornly held on to and professed that harmful opinion: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>When those monks were not able to separate the monk Ariṭṭha from that harmful opinion, they approached the Blessed One, paid respects to him, and sat to one side. While they were seated to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One, “Bhante, a harmful opinion has arisen in the monk named Ariṭṭha to this effect: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.’ Bhante, we heard that ‘A harmful opinion has arisen in the monk named Ariṭṭha…’ Then, Bhante, we went to the monk Ariṭṭha and said to him, ‘Venerable Ariṭṭha, is it true…?’ Then, Bhante, we enjoined, pressured, and entreated him in this way… Bhante, when we were not able to separate the monk Ariṭṭha from that harmful opinion, we reported this matter to the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Then the Blessed One said to a certain monk, “Go, monk, and summon the monk Ariṭṭha using my words: ‘Venerable Ariṭṭha, the Teacher summons you.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Yes, Bhante,” that monk replied to the Blessed One. He went to the monk Ariṭṭha and said to him, “Venerable Ariṭṭha, the Teacher summons you.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Yes, Venerable,” the monk Ariṭṭha replied to that monk. He approached the Blessed One, paid respects, and sat to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>When the monk Ariṭṭha was seated to one side, the Blessed One said to him, “Ariṭṭha, is it true that a harmful opinion has arisen in you to this effect: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Yes, Bhante. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things which are spoken of by the Blessed One as obstructive are not obstructive for one who indulges in them.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“You foolish man, how could you understand in that way the Dhamma taught by me? Foolish man, isn‘t it true that in many ways obstructive things have been spoken about by me as obstructive? They are obstructive for one who indulges in them. Sensuality has been spoken about by me as bringing little gratification, much suffering, and much anguish; the drawback here is greater <span class='add'>than the gratification</span>.

It brings much suffering and much anguish; the drawback here is greater <span class='add'>than the gratification</span>. Then you, foolish man, slander me with your bad grasp <span class='add'>of the teaching</span>. You ruin yourself and accumulate much demerit. Foolish man, this will be for your long-term detriment and suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, “What do you think, monks? Has this monk Ariṭṭha produced even a spark <span class='add'>of wisdom</span> in this Dhamma-Vinaya?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“How could that be, Bhante? Certainly not, Bhante.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>When this was said, the monk Ariṭṭha become silent and ashamed, and he sat with shoulders slumped and face downcast, sulky and unresponsive. Knowing that the monk Ariṭṭha was silent and ashamed, sitting with his shoulders slumped and face downcast, sulky and unresponsive, the Blessed One said to him, “Foolish man, you will be known by your own harmful opinion. I will question the monks about this.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, do you understand the Dhamma taught by me in the same way that the monk Ariṭṭha does, when he slanders me with his bad grasp <span class='add'>of the teaching</span>, ruining himself and accumulate much demerit?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Certainly not, Bhante. Bhante, in many ways obstructive things have been spoken about by the Blessed One as obstructive… the drawback here is greater <span class='add'>than the gratification</span>.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“Good, good, monks. Monks, it is good that you understand in this way the Dhamma taught by me. Monks, in many ways obstructive things have been spoken about by me as obstructive… the drawback here is greater <span class='add'>than the gratification</span>. Then this monk Ariṭṭha slanders me with his bad grasp <span class='add'>of the teaching</span>, ruining himself and accumulating much demerit. That will be for this foolish man‘s long-term detriment and suffering. Monks, it is not possible for one to indulge in sensuality without sensual <span class='add'>desires</span>, sensual perceptions, and sensual thoughts.</p>
<h2 class='add'>The Simile of the Viper</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Monks, here some foolish person learns<sup>1</sup> the Dhamma – discourses, poems, explanations, verses, exclamations, reports, birth-stories, wonders, and discussions<sup>2</sup>. Having learned the Dhamma, he does not wisely examine its meaning. Since the meaning of those teachings has not been wisely examined by him, they are not accepted<sup>3</sup> by him. He just learns the Dhamma so he can argue, so he can refute other people‘s statements. He learns the Dhamma, but he does not manifest its benefit. His bad grasp of the teachings leads to his long-term detriment and suffering. For what reason? Monks, because of the bad grasp of the teachings.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a>“Monks, imagine that a man needed a viper, was seeking a viper, was going about searching for a viper. He might see a large viper, and grab it by its body or tail. Then that viper would curl around and bite his hand or arm or one of his other limbs. Because of that he would die, or experience death-like pain. For what reason? Monks, because of the bad grasp of the viper. In the same way, monks, here some foolish man learns the Dhamma… His bad grasp of the teachings leads to his long-term detriment and suffering. For what reason?

He does not learn the Dhamma just so he can argue, nor just so he can refute other people‘s statements. He learns the Dhamma and manifests its benefit.

Monks, even though that snake might wrap its body around his hand or arm or one of his other limbs, he would not die or experience death-like pain because of that. For what reason? Monks, because of the good grasp of the viper. In the same way, monks, here some gentleman learns the Dhamma… His good grasp of the teachings leads to his long-term benefit and happiness.

<h2 class='add'>The Simile of the Raft</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“Monks, I will teach you how the Dhamma is like a raft; it is to be used for the sake of escaping<sup>4</sup>, not for the sake of grasping. Listen to this and carefully pay attention; I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“Yes, Bhante,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a>“Monks, imagine that a person was traveling on a road. He might see a large river, the near shore of which is risky and dangerous, and the far shore of which is safe and harmless; but there is no ferry-boat or bridge or any other way to cross. He would think, ‘The near shore of this large river is risky and dangerous, and the far shore is safe and harmless; but there is no ferry-boat or bridge or any other way to cross. Perhaps I will gather grass and wood and branches and leaves, bind them together into a raft, and then, relying on that raft, I will make an effort with my arms and legs to cross safely to the other side.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“Then, monks, that person gathered grass and wood and branches and leaves, bound them together into a raft, and then, relying on that raft, he made an effort with his arms and legs to cross safely to the other side. When he reached the other side, he would think, ‘This raft has done much for me; relying on this raft and making an effort with my arms and legs, I crossed safely to the other side. Perhaps I will put this raft on my head or carry it on my shoulders as I go about doing what I wish to do.’ What do you think, monks – is this person doing what should be done with that raft?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>“Certainly not, Bhante.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a>“Monks, how could this person do what should be done with that raft? Here, monks, when he reached the other side, he would think, ‘This raft has done much for me; relying on this raft and making an effort with my arms and legs, I crossed safely to the other side. Perhaps I will leave it on the ground or floating in the water as I go about doing what I wish to do.’ Monks, this person is doing what should be done with that raft.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>“In the same way, monks, I have taught you how the Dhamma is like a raft; it is for the purpose of escaping, not for the the purpose of grasping. Monks, I have taught you how the Dhamma is like a raft; those who understand this are to let go even of Dhamma, let alone non-Dhamma.</p>
<h2 class='add'>Six Standpoints of Wrong View</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>“Monks, there are six standpoints of <span class='add'>wrong</span> view. What six?</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc31' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>“Here, monks, an uneducated commoner – one who does not see the noble ones, has not mastered the teachings of the noble ones, is undisciplined in the teachings of the noble ones, does not see good people, has not mastered the teachings of good people, and is undisciplined in the teachings of good people – he sees the body as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self’; he sees identification as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self’; he sees mental objects as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self’; he sees whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, or explored with the mind as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self’; or based on this view – ‘The world is the self, and after death I will be permanent, stable, eternal, unchanging, and will remain that way forever’ – he sees that as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc32' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a>“Monks, an educated disciple of the noble ones – one who sees the noble ones, has mastered the teachings of the noble ones, is well-disciplined in the teachings of the noble ones, sees good people, has mastered the teachings of good people, and is well-disciplined in the teachings of good people – does not see the body as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self’; does not see identification as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self’; does not see mental objects as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self’; does not see whatever is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, or explored with the mind as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self’; and regarding this view – ‘The world is the self, and after death I will be permanent, stable, eternal, unchanging, and will remain that way forever’ – he does not see that as ‘This is me, I am this, this is my self.’ Seeing in this way, he is not agitated about what does not exist.”</p>
<h2 class='add'>Bases of Agitation</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>When this was said, a certain monk asked the Blessed One, “Bhante, can there be agitation about something external that does not exist?”</p>

Monk, in this way there is agitation about something external that does not exist.”</p>

It occurs to him, ‘It seems I will be cut off! It seems I will be destroyed! It seems I will be lost!’ He sorrows, frets, and laments, beating his chest and wailing, and becomes confused. Monk, in this way there is agitation about something internal that does not exist.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc77' href='#sc77'>SC 77</a>“Monks, even when others condemn, criticize, revile, and insult the Tathāgata, the Tathāgata is not irritated, bothered, or dissatisfied. Monks, even when others praise, honor, and revere the Tathāgata, the Tathāgata is not delighted, elated, or overjoyed. Monks, when others praise, honor, and revere the Tathāgata, the Tathāgata thinks, ‘This is how I act towards what has been understood.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc78' href='#sc78'>SC 78</a>“Therefore, monks, if others condemn, criticize, revile, and insult you, you should not be irritated, bothered, or dissatisfied. If others praise, honor, and revere you, you should not be delighted, elated, or overjoyed.
