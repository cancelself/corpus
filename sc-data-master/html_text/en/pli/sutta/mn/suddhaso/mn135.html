<h1 class='sutta-title'>135. The Lesser Analysis of Action</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta‘s Grove, at Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. Then the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya‘s son, approached the Blessed One and conversed with him. When the appropriate polite conversation was finished, he sat to one side. When he was seated to one side, Subha said to the Blessed One:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Sir Gotama<sup>1</sup>, what is the cause of and reason for the appearance of inferiority and superiority among human beings? Sir Gotama, there are humans who are seen to have short lives, and those who are seen to have long lives. There are those who are seen to have many afflictions, and those who are seen to have few afflictions. There are those who are seen to be ugly, and those who are seen to be beautiful. There are those who are seen to have little influence, and those who are seen to have much influence. There are those who are seen to have little wealth, and those who are seem to have much wealth. There are those who are seen to be from low families, and those who are seen to be from high families. There are those who are seen to be foolish, and those who are seen to be wise. Sir Gotama, what is the cause of and reason for the appearance of inferiority and superiority among human beings?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Student, beings are the owners of their actions, heirs of their actions, born from their actions, bound to their actions, returners to their actions. Action is what divides beings into inferiority and superiority.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“I do not understand the full meaning of the Blessed One‘s brief statement, which was made without giving an analysis of its full meaning. It would be good if Sir Gotama would teach me the Dhamma, such that I may understand the full meaning of the Blessed One‘s brief statement, which was made without giving an analysis of its full meaning.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Therefore, student, listen and carefully pay attention; I will speak.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Yes, sir,” the brahmin student Subha replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Student, here some woman or man is a killer – cruel, bloody-handed, fond of violence, merciless towards living beings. Because of that action which was undertaken and performed in that way, when that person is separated from their body after death, they will reappear in a state of deprivation, at a bad destination, in downfall, in hell.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>When this was said, the brahmin student Subha said to the Blessed One, “Magnificent, Sir Gotama! Magnificent, Sir Gotama! Sir Gotama, it is as if one were to turn upright what had been inverted, or reveal what was hidden, or describe the path to one who was confused, or bring an oil-lamp into the darkness so that those with eyesight could see – in the same way the Dhamma has been shown by Sir Gotama using many methods. I go for refuge to Sir Gotama, and to the Dhamma, and to the monastic Saṅgha. From this day forward, may Sir Gotama remember me as a lay disciple who has gone for refuge for life.”</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the way this discourse begins, we can conclude that Subha is not a follower of the Buddha, as he did not pay respects to the Buddha prior to taking a seat, and addressed the Buddha as <i lang='pli' translate='no'>bho</i> <span class='add'>(“sir” or “mister”)</span> rather than <i lang='pli' translate='no'>bhante</i> <span class='add'>(“venerable”)</span>.</li>
