<h1 class='sutta-title'>62. The Greater Discourse of Advice to Rāhula</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi, at Jeta‘s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika‘s park. Then the Blessed One dressed in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthi for alms. Venerable Rāhula also dressed, took his bowl and robe, and followed closely behind the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One looked back at Venerable Rāhula and said to him, “Rāhula, any body whatsoever – past, future, or present; internal or external; obvious or subtle; inferior or superior; far or near – every body is to be accurately seen with right wisdom in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Just the body, Blessed One? Just the body, Sublime One?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“The body, Rāhula, and also feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then Venerable Rāhula, thinking “How could one who has been personally advised by the Blessed One enter a village for alms?” turned back, sat at the base of a tree, crossed his legs, set his body upright, and established mindfulness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>Venerable Sāriputta saw Venerable Rāhula seated at the base of a tree – legs crossed, body upright, and mindfulness established. Having seen this, he said to Venerable Rāhula, “Rāhula, practice mindfulness of breathing. Rāhula, when mindfulness of breathing is practiced and cultivated, it is of great fruit and great benefit.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>Then in the evening Venerable Rāhula emerged from retreat, approached the Blessed One, paid respects to him, and sat to one side. When he was seated to one side, he said to the Blessed One, “Bhante, how is mindfulness of breathing to be practiced and cultivated so that it is of great fruit and great benefit?”</p>

It should be accurately seen with right wisdom in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ When one has accurately seen it with right wisdom in this way, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element, and the mind becomes dispassionate towards the earth element.</p>
