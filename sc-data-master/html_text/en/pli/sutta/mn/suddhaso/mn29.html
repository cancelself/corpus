<h1 class='sutta-title'>29. The Greater Discourse on the Simile of Heartwood</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Prosperous One was dwelling at Vulture Peak Mountain, not long after the departure of Devadatta. There, in reference to Devadatta, the Blessed One addressed the monks:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Monks, here some gentleman, based on faith, has left behind lay life and become a monastic renunciant, thinking ‘I am caught in birth, decay, death, sorrow, grief, pain, depression, and anguish, caught in suffering and enveloped by suffering. Perhaps a way to put an end to this whole heap of suffering can be discerned.’ When he has become a renunciant in this way, wealth, respect, and fame appear. He is satisfied with that wealth, respect, and fame, and it completely fills his thoughts. Because of that wealth, respect, and fame, he praises himself and disparages others, saying ‘I have wealth, respect, and fame, but these other monks are not well-known and have little influence.’ Intoxicated by that wealth, respect, and fame, he becomes negligent and heedless. Being negligent, he dwells in suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Monks, just as if a person who needed heartwood, was seeking heartwood, and was wandering in search of heartwood, came to a large, stable tree that had heartwood. He would bypass its heartwood, its softwood, its inner bark, and its outer bark. He would cut off its branches and leaves and depart, thinking it is heartwood. Then a person with eyes would see this and say, ‘This honorable person does not know what heartwood is, what softwood is, what inner bark is, what outer bark is, what leaves and branches are. This honorable person needed heartwood, was seeking heartwood, and was wandering in search of heartwood, and came to a large, stable tree that had heartwood. He bypassed its heartwood, its softwood, its inner bark, and its outer bark. He cut off its branches and leaves and departed, thinking it is heartwood. Whatever he is planning to do that requires heartwood will not be successful.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Monks, in the same way, here some gentleman, based on faith, has left behind lay life and become a monastic renunciant, thinking ‘I am caught in birth, decay, death, sorrow, grief, pain, depression, and anguish, caught in suffering and enveloped by suffering. Perhaps a way to put an end to this whole heap of suffering can be discerned.’ When he has become a renunciant in this way, wealth, respect, and fame appear. He is satisfied with that wealth, respect, and fame, and it completely fills his thoughts. Because of that wealth, respect, and fame, he praises himself and disparages others, saying ‘I have wealth, respect, and fame, but these other monks are not well-known and have little influence.’ Intoxicated by that wealth, respect, and fame, he becomes negligent and heedless. Being negligent, he dwells in suffering. Monks, this is called a monk who has taken the branches and leaves of the spiritual life; he has ended with that.</p>

He is not satisfied with that wealth, respect, and fame, and it does not completely fill his thoughts. He does not praise himself or disparage others because of that wealth, respect, and fame. Not intoxicated by that wealth, respect, and fame, he does not become negligent or heedless. Being vigilant, he attains perfect morality. He is satisfied with that perfection of morality, but it completely fills his thoughts. Because of that perfection of morality, he praises himself and disparages others, saying ‘I am moral and innately good, but these other monks are immoral and innately evil.’ Intoxicated by that perfection of morality, he becomes negligent and heedless. Being negligent, he dwells in suffering.</p>

Being negligent, he dwells in suffering.</p>
