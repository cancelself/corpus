<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta‘s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. Then in the evening Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita emerged from seclusion, approached Venerable Sāriputta, and conversed with him. When the appropriate polite conversation was completed, he sat to one side. When he was seated to one side, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to Venerable Sāriputta:</p>
<h2 class='add'><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Wisdom, Consciousness, Feeling, and Recognition</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Venerable, it is said ‘foolish, foolish.’ Venerable, why is one called ‘foolish’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“‘One does not understand, one does not understand’ – therefore, Venerable, one is called ‘foolish.’ And what does one not understand? One does not understand suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path of practice which leads to the cessation of suffering. ‘One does not understand, one does not understand’ – therefore, Venerable, one is called ‘foolish.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Excellent, Venerable,” Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita delighted and rejoiced in Venerable Sāriputta statements, then asked him a further question:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Venerable, it is said ‘wise, wise.’ Venerable, why is one called ‘wise’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“‘One understands, one understands’ – therefore, Venerable, one is called ‘wise.’ And what does one understand?

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Venerable, it is said ‘consciousness, consciousness.’ Venerable, why is it called ‘consciousness’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“‘One cognizes, one cognizes’ – therefore, Venerable, it is called ‘consciousness.’ And what does one cognize? One cognizes ‘pleasant,’ ‘unpleasant,’ and ‘neither pleasant nor unpleasant.’ ‘One cognizes, one cognizes’ – therefore, Venerable, it is called ‘consciousness.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Venerable, regarding wisdom and consciousness: are these phenomena separate or conjoined? Is it possible to distinguish these phenomena in order to describe what makes them different?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“Venerable, regarding wisdom and consciousness: these phenomena are conjoined, not separate. It is not possible to distinguish these phenomena in order to describe what makes them different. Venerable, what one understands, one cognizes; what one cognizes, one understands. Therefore these phenomena are conjoined, not separate. It is not possible to distinguish these phenomena in order to describe what makes them different.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“Venerable, regarding wisdom and consciousness: what is the difference between these phenomena which are conjoined and not separate?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc13' href='#sc13'>SC 13</a>“Venerable, regarding wisdom and consciousness: the difference between these phenomena which are conjoined and not separate is that wisdom is to be developed, whereas consciousness is to be completely understood.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc14' href='#sc14'>SC 14</a>“Venerable, it is said ‘feeling, feeling.’ Venerable, why is it called ‘feeling’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc15' href='#sc15'>SC 15</a>“‘One feels, one feels’ – therefore, Venerable, it is called ‘feeling.’ And what does one feel? One feels ‘pleasant,’ ‘unpleasant,’ and ‘neither pleasant nor unpleasant.’ ‘One feels, one feels’ – therefore, Venerable, it is called ‘feeling.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc16' href='#sc16'>SC 16</a>“Venerable, it is said ‘recognition, recognition.’ Venerable, why is it called ‘recognition’?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a>“‘One recognizes, one recognizes’ – therefore, Venerable, it is called ‘recognition.’ And what does one recognize? One recognizes blue, yellow, red, and white.<sup>1</sup> ‘One recognizes, one recognizes’ – therefore, Venerable, it is called ‘recognition.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a>“Venerable, regarding feeling, recognition, and consciousness: are these phenomena separate or conjoined? Is it possible to distinguish these phenomena in order to describe what makes them different?”</p>

Therefore these phenomena are conjoined, not separate. It is not possible to distinguish these phenomena in order to describe what makes them different.”</p>
<h2 class='add'><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a>The Domain of Completely Pure Mind-consciousness</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a>“Venerable, what can be known by a completely pure mind-consciousness which has been released from the five faculties?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a>“Venerable, a completely pure mind-consciousness which has been released from the five faculties can know the dimension of infinite space <span class='add'>with the thought</span> ‘Space is infinite’; it can know the dimension of infinite consciousness <span class='add'>with the thought</span> ‘Consciousness is infinite’; it can know the dimension of nothingness <span class='add'>with the thought</span> ‘There is nothing.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a>“Venerable, using what does one understand a knowable phenomenon?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a>“Venerable, one understands a knowable phenomenon using the eye of wisdom.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a>“Venerable, the purpose of wisdom is higher knowledge, complete knowledge, and letting go.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a>“Venerable, there are two conditions for the arising of right perspective: the voice of another, and wise attention. Venerable, these are the two conditions for the arising of right perspective.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a>“Venerable, supported by how many factors does right perspective have mental liberation as its result and benefit and wisdom-liberation as its result and benefit?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc31' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a>“Venerable, when supported by five factors, right perspective has mental liberation as its result and benefit and wisdom-liberation as its result and benefit.

Venerable, when supported by these five factors, right perspective has mental liberation as its result and benefit and wisdom-liberation as its result and benefit.”</p>
<h2 class='add'><a class='ref sc' id='sc32' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a>Existence</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a>“Venerable, how many kinds of existence are there?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a>“Venerable, there are three kinds of existence: sensual existence, material existence, and immaterial existence.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc35' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a>“Venerable, how does there come to be the production of renewed existence?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc36' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a>“Venerable, when beings who are obstructed by ignorance and bound by craving seek delight in various places, there is production of renewed existence.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc38' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a>“Venerable, with the fading away of ignorance, the arising of knowledge, and the cessation of craving, there is no production of renewed existence.”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc43' href='#sc43'>SC 43</a>“Venerable, the first Jhāna has five factors.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc44' href='#sc44'>SC 44</a>“Venerable, in the first Jhāna, what factors have been abandoned and what factors are present?”</p>

He engages in thought, investigation, rapture, happiness, and mental one-pointedness. Venerable, it is in this way that, in the first Jhāna, five factors have been abandoned and five factors are present.”</p>
<h2 class='add'><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a>The Five Sense-Faculties and the Nature of Vitality</h2>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49'>SC 49</a>“Venerable, these are the five faculties: the eye-faculty, the ear-faculty, the nose-faculty, the tongue-faculty, and the body-faculty. Venerable, what is it that the existence of the five faculties depends on?”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc54' href='#sc54'>SC 54</a>“The existence of warmth depends on vitality.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc55' href='#sc55'>SC 55</a>“Venerable, we understand the Venerable Sāriputta‘s statement just now as ‘The existence of vitality depends on warmth.’ We also understand the Venerable Sāriputta‘s statement just now as ‘The existence of warmth depends on vitality.’ Venerable, how is the meaning of this speech to be seen?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc56' href='#sc56'>SC 56</a>“Therefore, Venerable, I will make a simile; some discerning people understand the meaning of a statement by means of a simile. Venerable, just as the radiance of a burning oil-lamp is apparent because of the flame, and the flame is apparent because of the radiance; in the same way, Venerable, the existence of vitality depends on warmth, and the existence of warmth depends on vitality.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc57' href='#sc57'>SC 57</a>“Venerable, are vitality-formations experienceable phenomena, or are vitality-formations one thing and experienceable phenomena something else?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc58' href='#sc58'>SC 58</a>“Venerable, vitality-formations are not experienceable phenomena.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc59' href='#sc59'>SC 59</a>“Venerable, how many phenomena has this body abandoned when it lies forsaken and discarded like an insentient log?”</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc61' href='#sc61'>SC 61</a>“Venerable, what is the difference between one who is dead, and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc62' href='#sc62'>SC 62</a>“Venerable, when one is dead, the physical formations have ceased and subsided, the verbal formations have ceased and subsided, the mental formations have ceased and subsided, vitality is completely eliminated, warmth has faded, and the faculties have dissipated. When a monk has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, the physical formations have ceased and subsided, the verbal formations have ceased and subsided, the mental formations have ceased and subsided, vitality is not completely eliminated, warmth has not faded, and the faculties are very clear.

<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>These are presumably given merely as a few examples rather than a comprehensive list. The function of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>saññā</i> <span class='add'>(recognition)</span> is to identify sensory experiences – for example, when seeing a blue object one identifies it as blue, when seeing a cat one recognizes it as a cat, etc.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Sīla, suta, sākacchā, samatha, vipassanā</i>.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Saññā-vedayita-nirodha</i>. “The cessation of perception and feeling” is a state of deep concentration attainable only by practitioners who have completely abandoned sensual desire and aversion – that is, they are either non-returners or fully enlightened.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Ceto-vimutti.</i> The “liberations” described in this section are states of deep concentration where the mind is temporarily liberated from harmful mental states. This is not to be confused with true liberation, which comes only from the development of insight and is irreversible.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Nimitta</i>. In the Suttas this word means “object of awareness,” “image,” “characteristic,” etc. In this context it appears to refer to a meditation object. In apocryphal literature this term is used to refer to a bright light appearing at the onset of deep concentration, but this usage is not found in the Suttas.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Abhisaṅkhāra</i>.</li>
<li>“In the four directions” is a way of saying “in all directions.” Thus the meaning here is that one directs loving-friendliness everywhere and in every direction.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Muditā</i>. Being happy because others are experiencing good fortune.</li>
