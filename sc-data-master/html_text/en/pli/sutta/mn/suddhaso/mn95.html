</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was traveling among the Kosalans together with a large group of monks when he came to Opāsāda, a Kosalan village of brahmins. There the Blessed One lived north of Opāsāda, in Angel‘s Grove, a grove of sal trees.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>At that time the brahmin Caṅki was living in Opāsāda, a place filled with living beings, grass, lumber, water, and grain that had been given to him as a royal endowment of divine quality from King Pasenadi of Kosala.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>The brahmin householders of Opāsāda heard, “It seems the contemplative Gotama, son of a Sakyan, a renunciant from the Sakya clan, is traveling among the Kosalans together with a large group of monks, and has arrived at Opāsāda and is living north of Opāsāda in Angel‘s Grove, a grove of sal trees. This good report has come up about the honorable Gotama: ‘He is a Blessed One, a Worthy One, a Rightly Self-Awakened One; he has perfect knowledge and conduct; he is a Sublime One, a World-Knower, an unsurpassed trainer of tamable people, a teacher of angels and humans, an Awakened One, a Blessed One.’ Having personally attained higher knowledge of it by himself, he explains this world, with its angels, demons, divinities, its generation of contemplatives and priests, celestial and human beings. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in its conclusion, with the right meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is completely perfect and pure. It is good to see such worthy beings.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then groups of brahmin householders left Opāsāda through its northern entrance and went towards Angel‘s Grove, the grove of sal trees. On this occasion, the brahmin Caṅki had gone to the daybed at the top of his mansion. He saw that groups of brahmin householders had left Opāsāda through its northern entrance and were going to Angel‘s Grove, to the grove of sal trees. Having seen this, he said to Khatta, “Sir Khatta, why have groups of brahmin householders left Opāsāda through its northern entrance and are going towards Angel‘s Grove, the grove of sal trees?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Sir Caṅki, the contemplative Gotama… has arrived… This good report has come up… ‘He is a Blessed One…’ They go to see the honorable Gotama.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Therefore, sir Khatta, approach the brahmin householders from Opāsāda and say to them, ‘Sirs, the brahmin Caṅki says, “Please wait, the brahmin Caṅki also wishes to go and see the contemplative Gotama.”’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Yes, sir,” Khatta replied to the brahmin Caṅki. He approached the brahmin householders from Opāsāda and said to them, “Sirs, the brahmin Caṅki says, ‘Please wait, the brahmin Caṅki also wishes to go and see the contemplative Gotama.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>At that time there were five hundred brahmins from several other countries visiting Opāsāda on some errand. Those brahmins heard, “Apparently the brahmin Caṅki will go to see the contemplative Gotama.” Then those brahmins went to the brahmin Caṅki and said to him, “Sir Caṅki, is it true that you will go to see the contemplative Gotama?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“It is true, sirs, that I am thinking, ‘I will go to see the contemplative Gotama.’”</p>

Since the contemplative Gotama has arrived at Opāsāda, and is living north of Opāsāda in Angel‘s Grove, a grove of sal trees, the contemplative Gotama is our guest.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc43' href='#sc43'>SC 43</a>Then the brahmin Caṅki approached the Blessed One together with a large group of brahmins and conversed with him. After the appropriate polite conversation was finished, he sat to one side.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc44' href='#sc44'>SC 44</a>On this occasion the Blessed One was seated there after having engaged in some polite speech with several elderly brahmins. There was also a young sixteen-year-old student with a shaven head named Kāpaṭika seated in the assembly – he was a master of the Three Vedas, including all five of its divisions; he knew words and phrases, philosophy, and all the characteristics of great people. He interrupted the conversation that the elderly brahmins were having with the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc45' href='#sc45'>SC 45</a>Then the Blessed One rebuked the student Kāpaṭika: “Venerable Bhāradvāja should not interrupt the elderly brahmins’ conversation. He should wait until the conversation is finished.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a>When this was said, the brahmin Caṅki said to the Blessed One, “Sir Gotama should not rebuke the student Kāpaṭika. The student Kāpaṭika is a gentleman, very learned, wise, and a good speaker; he is able to participate in this discussion with the Blessed One.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc47' href='#sc47'>SC 47</a>Then the Blessed One thought, “Most likely the student Kāpaṭika‘s statements will be about the brahmin scriptures of the Three Sciences. This is why the brahmins respect him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc48' href='#sc48'>SC 48</a>Then the student Kāpaṭika thought, “When the contemplative Gotama looks at my eyes, I will ask him a question.” The Blessed One read the student Kāpaṭika‘s mind, and looked at his eyes.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49'>SC 49</a>Then the student Kāpaṭika thought, “The contemplative Gotama is paying attention to me. Perhaps I will ask him a question.” Then he said to the Blessed One, “Sir Gotama, regarding the mantras, aphorisms, and scriptures of the ancient brahmins, contemporary brahmins arrive at the definite conclusion, ‘Only this is true, everything else is false.’ What does Sir Gotama say about this?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc50' href='#sc50'>SC 50</a>“Bhāradvāja, is there even one brahmin among all brahmins who says, ‘I know this, I see this. Only this is true, everything else is false’?”</p>
