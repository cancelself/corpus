<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta‘s Grove, at Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks: “Venerable monks!” “Venerable,” those monks replied to Venerable Sāriputta. Venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerables, it is said, ‘Right perspective, right perspective.’ Venerables, how does a noble disciple have right perspective, <span class='add'>how is</span> his perspective upright,<sup>1</sup> <span class='add'>how is</span> he possessed of certainty and confidence in the Dhamma, <span class='add'>how is</span> he one who has arrived at this true Dhamma?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Venerable, we might come from far away to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. It would be excellent if Venerable Sāriputta would make evident the meaning of this statement. After hearing it from Venerable Sāriputta, the monks will remember it.” “Therefore, Venerables, listen and carefully pay attention. I will speak.” “Yes, Venerable,” those monks replied to Venerable Sāriputta. Venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Venerables, when a noble disciple understands the unwholesome, understands the root of the unwholesome, understands the wholesome, understands the root of the wholesome – this, Venerables, is how a noble disciple has right perspective, <span class='add'>how</span> his perspective is upright, <span class='add'>how</span> he is possessed of certainty and confidence in the Dhamma, <span class='add'>how</span> he is one who has arrived at this true Dhamma.

Abstinence from frivolous prattle is wholesome. Non-covetousness is wholesome. Non-ill will is wholesome. Right perspective is wholesome.
