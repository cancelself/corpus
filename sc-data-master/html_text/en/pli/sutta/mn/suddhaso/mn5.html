<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta‘s Grove, at Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. There Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks: “Venerable monks!” “Venerable sir,” those monks replied to Venerable Sāriputta. Venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Venerables, there are four kinds of people that can be found in the world. What four? Here, Venerables, some person who has a flaw does not understand as it really is:<sup>1</sup> ‘I have an internal flaw.’ Here, Venerables, some person who has a flaw understands as it really is: ‘I have an internal flaw.’ Here, Venerables, some person who is flawless does not understand as it really is: ‘I do not have an internal flaw.’ Here, Venerables, some person who is flawless understands as it really is: ‘I do not have an internal flaw.’ There, Venerables, regarding the person who has a flaw and does not understand as it really is ‘I have an internal flaw’: of the two people who have flaws, this one is declared the inferior person. There, Venerables, regarding the person who has a flaw and understands as it really is ‘I have an internal flaw’: of the two people who have flaws, this one is declared the best person. There, Venerables, regarding the flawless person who does not understand as it really is ‘I do not have an internal flaw’: of the two people who are flawless, this one is declared the inferior person. There, Venerables, regarding the flawless person who understands as it really is ‘I do not have an internal flaw’: of the two people who are flawless, this one is declared the best person.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When this was said, Venerable Mahā-Moggallāna said to Venerable Sāriputta, “What is the cause, Venerable Sāriputta, what is the condition on account of which, of these two people who have flaws, one is declared the inferior person, and one is declared the best person? And, Venerable Sāriputta, what is the cause, what is the condition because of which, of these two people who are flawless, one is declared the inferior person, and one is declared the best person?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“There, Venerable, this is expected of the person who has a flaw and does not understand as it really is ‘I have an internal flaw’: he will not produce interest,<sup>2</sup> make an effort, and initiate energy for the abandoning of that flaw; he will die while he has lust, anger, delusion, flaws, and a defiled mind. Venerable, it is just like when a bronze dish is brought from a market or a metalsmith which is covered with dirt and stains. The owner of that dish neither uses it nor cleans it, and sets it down in a dirty place. In this way, Venerable, will that bronze dish on a later occasion be more defiled and stained?” “Yes, Venerable.” “In the same way, Venerable, this is expected of the person who has a flaw and does not understand… he will die while he has lust, anger, delusion, flaws, and a defiled mind.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“There, Venerable, this is expected of the flawless person who does not understand as it really is ‘I do not have an internal flaw’: he will pay attention to beauty,<sup>3</sup> and because of his attention to beauty lust will assault his mind; he will die while he has lust, anger, delusion, flaws, and a defiled mind. Venerable, it is just like when a bronze dish is brought from a market or a metalsmith which is pure and clean.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a>When this was said, Venerable Mahā-Moggallāna said to Venerable Sāriputta, “Venerable, a simile occurs to me.” “Then let it occur, Venerable Moggallāna.” “Venerable, on one occasion I was dwelling at Rājagaha, at Giribbaja. Then, Venerable, after dressing in the morning and taking my bowl and robe, I entered Rājagaha for alms. Now on that occasion Samīti the cartwright‘s son was carving a wheel for a chariot. The Ājīvaka Paṇḍuputta, who was formerly a cartwright, was present as well. Then, Venerable, this line of thought arose in the mind of the Ājīvaka Paṇḍuputta: ‘Oh, may Samīti the cartwright‘s son carve away the crookedness, deformity, and flaws of this wheel, such that it may be free of crookedness, free of deformity, free of flaws, pure, established in its ideal state<sup>9</sup>.’ While this line of thought was present in the Ājīvaka Paṇḍuputta‘s mind, Samīti the cartwright‘s son carved away the crookedness, deformity, and flaws of that wheel.
