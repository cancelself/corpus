<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta‘s Grove, at Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!” “Auspicious sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Monks, when there is a monk for whom five kinds of mental desolation have not been abandoned and five kinds of mental imprisonment have not been destroyed<sup>1</sup>, it is not possible for him to attain growth, development, and fulfillment in this Dhamma-Vinaya.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“What are the five kinds of mental desolation that have not been abandoned by him? Here, monks, a monk is uncertain and doubtful about the Teacher<sup>2</sup>, and has not resolved his mind and become confident <span class='add'>in the Teacher</span>. Monks, when a monk is uncertain and doubtful about the Teacher and has not resolved his mind and become confident <span class='add'>in the Teacher</span>, his mind does not tend towards ardency, commitment, perseverance, and striving. As his mind does not tend towards ardency, commitment, perseverance, and striving, this is the first kind of mental desolation that has not been abandoned by him.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Monks, this is another one: There is a monk who is uncertain and doubtful about the Dhamma… about the Saṅgha… about the training, and has not resolved his mind and become confident <span class='add'>in the training</span>.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Monks, this is another one: There is a monk who is angry and dissatisfied with his co-practitioners, who has an afflicted mind and a callous nature.
