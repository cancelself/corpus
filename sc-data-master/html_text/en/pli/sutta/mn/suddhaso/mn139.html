<h1 class='sutta-title'>139. Analysis of Non-Conflict</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in Jeta‘s Grove, at Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!” “Auspicious sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “Monks, I will teach an analysis of non-conflict<sup>1</sup> for you. Listen to this and carefully pay attention; I will speak.” “Yes, Bhante,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“One should not be committed to sensual pleasure, which is inferior, <span class='add'>the behavior</span> of villagers<sup>2</sup>, <span class='add'>the behavior</span> of commoners<sup>3</sup>, ignoble, and unbeneficial. One should also not be committed to self-torment, which is painful, ignoble, and unbeneficial. Monks, without approaching either of these two extremes, a moderate path of practice<sup>4</sup> has been awakened to by the Tathāgata, which produces vision, produces knowledge, and leads to tranquility, higher knowledge, awakening, and Nibbāna. One should understand flattery and one should understand disparagement. Having understood flattery and disparagement, one should neither flatter nor disparage; one should just teach the Dhamma. One should understand the definition of happiness. Having understood the definition of happiness, one should be committed to internal happiness. One is not to gossip<sup>5</sup>, and one is not to make critical remarks about a person who is present. One is to speak unhurriedly, not hurriedly. One is not to insist on using the language of a <span class='add'>particular</span> country, and one is not to override conventional <span class='add'>terminology</span>. This is the table of contents for the analysis of non-conflict.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a>“Monks, there are these five cords of sensuality. What five? Visible objects cognizable by the eye which are desirable, appealing, pleasing, enjoyable, sensual, and exciting. Sounds cognizable by the ear… fragrances cognizable by the nose… flavors cognizable by the tongue… tangible objects cognizable by the body which are desirable, appealing, pleasing, enjoyable, sensual, and exciting. Monks, these are the five cords of sensuality. Monks, any pleasure and elation that arises dependent on these five cords of sensuality is called sensual pleasure, dirty<sup>6</sup> pleasure, vulgar pleasure, ignoble pleasure. I say that such pleasure is not to be cultivated, not to be developed, not to be made much of; such pleasure is to be regarded as dangerous.</p>

With the tranquilizing of thought and consideration, he attains and remains in the second <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, which has internal composure, mental unification, is free of thought, is free of consideration, and has rapture and happiness produced by concentration. With the dissipation of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, and clearly aware, experiencing pleasure with the body; what the noble ones describe as ‘Equanimous, mindful, and dwelling happily’ – he attains and remains in the third <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i>. With the abandoning of pleasure, the abandoning of pain, and the previous disappearance of elation and dejection, he attains and remains in the fourth <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, which has neither pain nor pleasure, and has purity of mindfulness and equanimity. This is called the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of tranquility, the pleasure of awakening. I say that such pleasure is to be cultivated, is to be developed, is to be made much of; such pleasure is not to be regarded as dangerous.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Araṇa</i>. Usually this word means “solitude.” However, in this context it appears to be the negation of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>raṇa</i> <span class='add'>(conflict)</span>, and thus means “non-conflict.”</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Gamma</i>. Lit. “of the village.” From the word <i lang='pli' translate='no'>gāma</i> <span class='add'>(village)</span>.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Pothujjanika</i>. Lit. “connected <span class='add'>(<i lang='pli' translate='no'>ika</i>)</span> with many/most <i lang='pli' translate='no'><span class='add'>(puthu</span></i><span class='add'>)</span> people <span class='add'>(<i lang='pli' translate='no'>jana</i>)</span>.”</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Majjhimā paṭipadā</i>. More commonly rendered as “middle path.”</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Raho-vāda</i>. Lit. “secret statement.” As this is given as the opposite of making critical remarks about a person when they are present, it is reasonable to conclude that it refers to making remarks about a person when they are not present – that is, gossip.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Mīḷha.</i> Lit. “excrement.”</li>
<li>This statement stands in sharp contrast to the opinion that <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i> practice is dangerous and best avoided, which is an opinion found in some contemporary meditation traditions. Here we clearly see the exact opposite opinion coming the Buddha himself – namely, that <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i> practice should not be considered dangerous and most certainly should be engaged in.</li>
<li><i lang='pli' translate='no'>Saraṇa</i>. While usually this means “refuge,” in this case it is a compound of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>sa</i> <span class='add'>(with)</span> + <i lang='pli' translate='no'>raṇa</i> <span class='add'>(conflict)</span>.</li>
