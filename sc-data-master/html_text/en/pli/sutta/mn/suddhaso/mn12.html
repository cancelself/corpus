<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesāli, in a grove to the west of the town of Bahi. On this occasion, the Licchavi Sunakkhatta had recently left this Dhamma-Vinaya<sup>1</sup>. All around Vesāli he was saying, “The contemplative Gotama does not have any superhuman states, nor has he attained any distinction in knowledge and vision that would make him noble. The contemplative Gotama teaches a Dhamma that is the result of thinking, accompanied by investigation, produced by his own eloquence<sup>2</sup>. However, when that teaching is taught to anyone, it does lead one who practices it to the correct elimination of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then in the morning Venerable Sāriputta dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesāli for alms. He heard of the Licchavi Sunakkhatta saying all around Vesāli, “The contemplative Gotama does not have any superhuman states… However, when that teaching is taught to anyone, it does lead one who practices it to the correct elimination of suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>When Venerable Sāriputta had gone for alms in Sāvatthi, finished his meal, and returned from almsround, he approached the Blessed One, paid respects to him, and sat to one side. When he was seated to one side, Venerable Sāriputta said to the Blessed One, “Bhante, the Licchavi Sunakkhatta has recently left this Dhamma-Vinaya. All around Vesāli he is saying, ‘The contemplative Gotama… the correct elimination of suffering.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Sāriputta, Sunakkhatta is an angry, foolish man. This statement he has spoken is the result of anger. Sāriputta, thinking ‘I will speak criticism<sup>3</sup>,’ this foolish man Sunakkhatta only speaks praise of the Tathāgata. Sāriputta, it is praise of the Tathāgata when one says, ‘When that teaching is taught to anyone, it does lead one who practices it to the correct elimination of suffering.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Sāriputta, this Dhamma-inference about me will never occur to the foolish man Sunakkhatta: ‘The Blessed One is an Arahant, a Fully Self-Awakened One, perfect in knowledge and conduct, sublime, a world-knower, an unsurpassable trainer of trainable people, a teacher of celestial and human beings, a Buddha, a Blessed One.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Sāriputta, this Dhamma-inference about me will never occur to the foolish man Sunakkhatta: ‘The Blessed One manifests many kinds of psychic powers – having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and disappears; he moves unobstructed through walls, fences, and mountains as if it was space; he dives in and out of the earth as if it was water; he moves across water without sinking, as if it was earth; he moves cross-legged through the sky like a bird; with his hand he touches and holds the sun and moon, so powerful and majestic; he personally extends his authority as far as the Brahma-world.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Sāriputta, this Dhamma-inference about me will never occur to the foolish man Sunakkhatta: ‘With the divine ear-element, which is purified and transcends human hearing, the Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds – celestial and human, far and near.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Sāriputta, this Dhamma-inference about me will never occur to the foolish man Sunakkhatta: ‘Using his own mind, the Blessed One knows the minds of other beings and other individuals: he knows a lustful mind as a lustful mind, or a lust-free mind as a lust-free mind; he knows a hate-filled mind as a hate-filled mind, or a hate-free mind as a hate-free mind; he knows a delusional mind as a delusional mind, or a delusion-free mind as a delusion-free mind; he knows a contracted mind as a contracted mind, or a scattered mind as a scattered mind; he knows an expanded mind as an expanded mind, or an unexpanded mind as an unexpanded mind; he knows a surpassable mind as a surpassable mind, or an unsurpassable mind as an unsurpassable mind; he knows a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, or an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind; he knows a liberated mind as a liberated mind, or a non-liberated mind as a non-liberated mind.’</p>

Falling from there, I appeared here.’ In this way, he remembers numerous past lives and their characteristics in detail. Sāriputta, this is a Tathāgata-power on account of which a Tathāgata claims his place as leader, roars his lion‘s roar in assemblies, and sets in motion the divine wheel.</p>

When they were separated from their bodies after death, they appeared in deprivation, a bad destination, downfall – hell.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc48' href='#sc48'>SC 48</a>“Sāriputta, if one who knows and sees this says about me ‘The contemplative Gotama does not have any superhuman states…’ then they will end up in hell as they deserve.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49'>SC 49</a>“Sāriputta, I remember that I lived the four-factor spiritual life<sup>14</sup> – I was an ascetic<sup>15</sup>, supremely ascetic; I was coarse, supremely coarse; I was careful, supremely careful; I was secluded, supremely secluded.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc50' href='#sc50'>SC 50</a>“Sāriputta, this was my asceticism: I went without clothing, rejecting normal behavior, licking my hands, not coming when invited to come or staying when invited to stay, not accepting what was brought for me or designated for me or that I was specifically invited for. I did not receive food from the mouth of a pot, from the mouth of a basket, across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two people eating, from a pregnant woman, from a nursing woman, from a woman among men, from a gathering of famous people<sup>16</sup>, from a place where dogs stay, from a place where flies are clustered; I did not eat fish or meat, I did not drink liquor, wine, or beer; I went to only one house and ate only one portion, or I went to two houses and ate only two portions… or I went to only seven houses and ate only seven portions; I lived on one offering a day, or two offerings a day… or seven offerings a day; I ate only once a day, or once every two days… or once every seven days; in this way, I practiced eating at specific intervals, even to the point of eating only once per fortnight. I ate only vegetables, or only millet, or only grain, or only sinew, or only moss, or only rice-bran, or only foam from cooking-pots, or only sesame seeds, or only grass, or only cow-dung, or I lived on roots and fruits gathered in the forest, or I lived on fruit fallen from trees. I wore hemp-cloth, or hemp blends, or cloth taken from corpses, or discarded rags, or tree-bark, or an antelope hide, or pieces of antelope hide, or woven grass, or cloth made from bark, or cloth made from wood, or a blanket made of human hair, or a blanket made of horse hair, or owl-wings. I pulled out my beard, I was committed to pulling out my beard; I stood continuously, I refused to sit; I squatted continuously, I was committed to the exertion of squatting; I used a mattress of thorns, I slept on a mattress of thorns; I was committed to bathing three times a day, even in the evening. In this way, I was committed to many ways of tormenting<sup>17</sup> the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc51' href='#sc51'>SC 51</a>“Sāriputta, this was my coarseness: for years I allowed dirt and mud to accumulate on my body, like the bark of a tree. Sāriputta, just as the trunk of a Tindukā tree accumulates bark over the years, in the same way, for years I allowed dirt and mud to accumulate on my body, like the bark of a tree. Sāriputta, I never thought, ‘I could rub this dirt and mud off with my hands, or someone else could rub this dirt and mud off with their hands.’ Sāriputta, I never thought this. Sāriputta, this was my coarseness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc52' href='#sc52'>SC 52</a>“Sāriputta, this was my carefulness: I was mindful when moving forward and mindful when moving backward, with compassion established in me even towards a drop of water, thinking ‘May I not bring harm to the tiny beings who live in uneven ground.’ Sāriputta, this was my carefulness.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc53' href='#sc53'>SC 53</a>“Sāriputta, this was my seclusion: I entered and lived in a particular wilderness domain. When I saw a cow-herder or a shepherd or a grass-collector or a wood-gatherer or a forest worker, then I would flee from grove to grove, from jungle to jungle, from valley to valley, from plateau to plateau. For what reason? So that they would not see me and I would not see them. Sāriputta, just as a wild animal, when it sees a human, flees from grove to grove, from jungle to jungle, from valley to valley, from plateau to plateau, in the same way, Sāriputta, when I saw a cow-herder or a shepherd or a grass-collector or a wood-gatherer or a forest worker, then I would flee from grove to grove, from jungle to jungle, from valley to valley, from plateau to plateau.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc54' href='#sc54'>SC 54</a>“Sāriputta, when there was a cow-shed with cows inside and the cowherd had left, then I would approach on all fours and feed on the cow-dung left by young nursing calves. Sāriputta, as long as my own urine and excrement did not run out, I lived on my own urine and excrement. Sāriputta, this was my practice of eating filth.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc55' href='#sc55'>SC 55</a>“Sāriputta, I entered and lived in a particular terrifying forest grove – a forest grove so terrifying that almost anyone who entered that was not free of lust would find their hair standing on end. Sāriputta, during the coldest part of the winter, when snow was falling, I would sit in the open air at night and in the forest grove during the day; and during the hottest part of the summer I would sit in the open air during the day and in the forest grove at night. Then I spoke these spontaneous verses that I had never heard before: ‘Scorched and chilled, alone in the terrifying forest; naked and with no fire to sit beside, the sage is intent upon his quest.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc56' href='#sc56'>SC 56</a>“Sāriputta, I slept in cemeteries next to bones. Cowherd boys would approach me and spit on me, urinate on me, scatter dirt on me, and put sticks in my ears. However, Sāriputta, I do not recall ever producing a harmful mindstate about them. Sāriputta, this was my practice of equanimity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc57' href='#sc57'>SC 57</a>“Sāriputta, there are some contemplatives and brahmins who profess this perspective: ‘Purity comes through food.’ They say, ‘We will live on <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i><sup>18</sup>.’ They eat <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i>, they eat powdered <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i>, they drink <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i> juice – they enjoy many kinds of <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i> products. Sāriputta, I recall my food was just one <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i> <span class='add'>per day</span>. Sāriputta, it is possible that they might think, ‘At that time <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i> must have been very large.’ Sāriputta, this is not the way to see it; at that time <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i> was no bigger than it is now. Sāriputta, by eating just one <i lang='pli' translate='no'>kola</i> <span class='add'>per day</span>, my body became extremely emaciated. Because of eating so little, my limbs became like old, weathered stalks; my buttocks became like a camel‘s hoof; my spine protruded like a string of beads; my ribs stuck out like the broken rafters of an old run-down house; my eyes glittered deep in my eye-sockets like water at the bottom of a deep well; my scalp became as wrinkled and withered as a soft gourd left in the wind and sun. Sāriputta, if I wished to touch my stomach, I could feel it through my back; if I wished to touch my spine, I could feel it through my abdomen. Sāriputta, because of eating so little, my stomach stuck to my spine. Sāriputta, because of eating so little, I would fall over when I tried to defecate or urinate. Sāriputta, because of eating so little, the roots of my body-hairs were so rotten that if I rubbed my limbs in order to soothe my body, the hair would fall out.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc58' href='#sc58'>SC 58</a>“Sāriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‘Purity comes through food.’ They say, ‘We will live on beans… sesame seeds… rice…’ …because of eating so little, the roots of my body-hairs were so rotten that if I rubbed my limbs in order to soothe my body, the hair would fall out.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc59' href='#sc59'>SC 59</a>“Sāriputta, I did not attain any superhuman states or any distinction in knowledge and vision that would make me noble by engaging in these behaviors, these practices, and these austerities<sup>19</sup>. For what reason? Because I did not reach any noble wisdom – the noble wisdom which, once reached, is a noble guide which guides its enactor to the correct elimination of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc60' href='#sc60'>SC 60</a>“Sāriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‘Purity comes through <i lang='pli' translate='no'>saṁsāra</i>.’ Sāriputta, it is not easy to find any state of being in Saṁsāra which I had not previously experienced during this long cycle of existence, except for the Pure-Abode<sup>20</sup> Devas.

Sāriputta, had I been reborn as a Pure-Abode Deva, I would not have returned to this world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc62' href='#sc62'>SC 62</a>“Sāriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‘Purity comes through living.’ Sāriputta, it is not easy to find any life in Saṁsāra which I had not previously lived during this long cycle of existence, except for the Pure-Abode Devas. Sāriputta, had I lived as a Pure-Abode Deva, I would not have returned to this world.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc63' href='#sc63'>SC 63</a>“Sāriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‘Purity comes through sacrifice.’ Sāriputta, it is not easy to find any sacrifice in Saṁsāra which I had not previously sacrificed during this long cycle of existence, when I was a royal anointed king or a wealthy brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc64' href='#sc64'>SC 64</a>“Sāriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‘Purity comes through fire-worship.’ Sāriputta, it is not easy to find any fire in Saṁsāra which I had not previously worshiped during this long cycle of existence, when I was a royal anointed king or a wealthy brahmin.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc65' href='#sc65'>SC 65</a>“Sāriputta, there are some contemplatives or brahmins who profess this perspective: ‘As long as a person is young, youthful, with dark hair, blessed with youth, in the first stage of life – then they have the utmost lucidity of wisdom. When this person is decrepit, aged, old, in the last stage of life, eighty or ninety or a hundred years of age – then they lose that lucidity of wisdom.’ Sāriputta, this is not how it is to be seen. Sāriputta, I am now decrepit, aged, old, in the last stage of life; I have lived for eighty years. Sāriputta, I might have four disciples who each had a lifespan of one hundred years, who had the utmost mindfulness, perseverance, and steadfastness, and the utmost lucidity of wisdom. Sāriputta, just as a strong archer who has trained, practiced, and apprenticed could easily shoot a lightweight arrow across the shadow of a tree, in the same way they have extreme mindfulness, extreme perseverance, and extreme steadfastness. They might repeatedly ask me questions about the establishment of mindfulness, and when asked I would answer, and they would remember my answer; and they would not ask any question twice. Sāriputta, except for urinating, defecating, and relieving exhaustion and sleepiness, there would be no end to the Tathāgata‘s teaching of the Dhamma, no end to the Tathāgata‘s explanations of the Dhamma, no end to the Tathāgata‘s answers. Then those four disciples, each with a lifespan of a hundred years, would reach the end of their hundred years and die. Sāriputta, even if you have to carry me around on a bed, still there will be no alteration of the Tathāgata‘s lucidity of wisdom. Sāriputta, one who correctly speaks of someone as ‘A being who is naturally free of confusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans,’ they would rightly speak of me as ‘A being who is naturally free of confusion has arisen in the world for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc66' href='#sc66'>SC 66</a>On this occasion Venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him. Then Venerable Nāgasamāla said to the Blessed One, “Wonderful, Bhante! Amazing, Bhante! Bhante, while listening to this Dhamma-teaching my hair stood on end. Bhante, what is the name of this Dhamma-teaching?” “Because of that, Nāgasamāla, you may remember this Dhamma-teaching as the ‘Hair-Raising Teaching.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc67' href='#sc67'>SC 67</a>This is what the Blessed One said. Satisfied, Venerable Nāgasamāla delighted in the Blessed One‘s speech.</p>
