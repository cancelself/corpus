</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi, in Jeta‘s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. Then in the evening Venerable Mahā-Cunda emerged from seclusion, approached the Blessed One, paid respects to him, and sat to one side. When he was seated to one side, Venerable Mahā-Cunda said to the Blessed One, “Bhante, there are many kinds of perspectives that arise in the world, connected with beliefs about self or beliefs about the world. Bhante, when he is just beginning, what should a monk pay attention to so that these perspectives are abandoned and relinquished?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Cunda, there are many kinds of perspectives that arise in the world, connected with beliefs about self or beliefs about the world. Where these perspectives arise, where they lay dormant, and where they occur, one sees them as they are with correct discernment in this way: ‘This is not mine, this is not me, this is not my self.’ In this way these perspectives are abandoned and relinquished.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Cunda, it is possible that, secluded from sensuality and from unwholesome phenomena, a monk might attain and remain in the first Jhāna, which has thought, examination, and the rapture and happiness born from seclusion. He might think ‘I am living with humility.’ Cunda, this is not what is called ‘humility’ in the discipline of the noble ones. This is called ‘living happily here and now’ in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Cunda, it is possible that, with the abatement of thought and evaluation, a monk might attain and remain in the second Jhāna, which has internal serenity, mental focus, no thought, no evaluation, and has the rapture and happiness produced by concentration. He might think ‘I am living with humility.’ Cunda, this is not what is called ‘humility’ in the discipline of the noble ones. This is called ‘living happily here and now’ in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Cunda, it is possible that, with the fading of rapture, a monk might attain and remain in the third Jhāna, and is equanimous, mindful, and completely aware, experiencing happiness through the body – what the noble ones call ‘one who is equanimous, mindful, and happy.’ He might think ‘I am living with humility.’ Cunda, this is not what is called ‘humility’ in the discipline of the noble ones. This is called ‘living happily here and now’ in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“Cunda, it is possible that, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the prior disappearance of elation and depression, a monk might attain and remain in the fourth Jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and has purity of mindfulness and equanimity. He might think ‘I am living with humility.’ Cunda, this is not what is called ‘humility’ in the discipline of the noble ones. This is called ‘living happily here and now’ in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“Cunda, it is possible that, by completely transcending all perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and by not paying attention to perceptions of diversity, <span class='add'>perceiving</span> infinite space, a monk might attain and remain in the dimension of infinite space. He might think ‘I am living with humility.’ Cunda, this is not what is called ‘humility’ in the discipline of the noble ones. This is called ‘living peacefully’ in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“Cunda, it is possible that, by completely transcending the dimension of infinite space, <span class='add'>perceiving</span> infinite consciousness, a monk might attain and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. He might think ‘I am living with humility.’ Cunda, this is not what is called ‘humility’ in the discipline of the noble ones. This is called ‘living peacefully’ in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“Cunda, it is possible that, by completely transcending the dimension of infinite consciousness, <span class='add'>perceiving</span> nothing existing, a monk might attain and remain in the dimension of nothingness. He might think ‘I am living with humility.’ Cunda, this is not what is called ‘humility’ in the discipline of the noble ones. This is called ‘living peacefully’ in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“Cunda, it is possible that, by completely transcending the dimension of nothingness, a monk might attain and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. He might think ‘I am living with humility.’ Cunda, this is not what is called ‘humility’ in the discipline of the noble ones. This is called ‘living peacefully’ in the discipline of the noble ones.</p>

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc56' href='#sc56'>SC 56</a>“Cunda, I say that even directing the mind towards wholesome phenomena is very helpful – not to speak of acting accordingly with body and speech! Therefore, Cunda, one is to direct the mind in this way: ‘Others will be cruel; we will not be cruel.’ …one is to direct the mind in this way: ‘Others will hold tightly to their opinions and relinquish them with difficulty; we will not hold tightly to our opinions and we will relinquish them easily.’</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc57' href='#sc57'>SC 57</a>“Cunda, it is as if there was an uneven road, and there was a different road that was even that one could use to circumvent it; or there was an uneven ford, and there was a different ford that was even that one could use to circumvent it. In the same way, Cunda, for a person who is cruel, there is non-cruelty to circumvent it; for a person who kills, there is non-killing to circumvent it… for a person who holds tightly to their opinions and relinquishes them with difficulty, there is not holding tightly to one‘s opinions and relinquishing them easily to circumvent it.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc58' href='#sc58'>SC 58</a>“Cunda, just as all unwholesome phenomena lead down and all wholesome phenomena lead up, in the same way, Cunda, for a person who is cruel, there is non-cruelty for rising up… for one who holds tightly to their opinions and relinquishes them with difficulty, there is not holding tightly to one‘s opinions and relinquishing them easily for rising up.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc59' href='#sc59'>SC 59</a>“Cunda, it is impossible for a person who is stuck in mud to pull another person out of the mud. Cunda, it is possible for a person who is not stuck in mud to pull another person out of the mud. Cunda, it is impossible for a person who is not trained, not disciplined, and not enlightened to train, discipline, and enlighten another person. Cunda, it is possible for a person who is trained, disciplined, and enlightened to train, discipline, and enlighten another person. In the same way, Cunda, for a person who is cruel, there is non-cruelty for attaining enlightenment<sup>3</sup>… for a person who holds tightly to their opinions and relinquishes them with difficulty, there is not holding tightly to one‘s opinions and relinquishing them easily for attaining enlightenment.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc60' href='#sc60'>SC 60</a>“Cunda, I have taught you a discourse on humility. I have taught you a discourse on directing the mind. I have taught you a discourse on circumventing. I have taught you a discourse on rising up. I have taught you a discourse on attaining enlightenment. Cunda, I have compassionately done for you what should be done by a teacher who compassionately seeks to benefit his disciples. Cunda, there are the feet of trees, there are empty buildings; meditate, Cunda, do not be negligent, do not do what you will later regret: this is my instruction for you.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc61' href='#sc61'>SC 61</a>This is what the Blessed One said. Satisfied, Venerable Mahā-Cunda delighted in the Blessed One‘s statement.</p>
