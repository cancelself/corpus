<h1 class='sutta-title'>1. Discourse on the Root</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Ukkaṭṭha, in the Subhaga Grove, at the root of a Sāla-Rāja tree. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!” “Auspicious sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “Monks, I will teach you a discourse on the root of all phenomena. Listen and carefully pay attention: I will speak.” “Yes, Bhante,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Monks, here an unlearned ordinary person – one who does not see noble ones, who has not mastered the teaching of the noble ones, who is undisciplined in the teaching of the noble ones, does not see good people, has not mastered the teaching of good people, and who is undisciplined in the teaching of good people – perceives earth as earth. Having perceived earth as earth, such a one conceives of earth, conceives in terms of earth, conceives from <span class='add'>a basis of</span> earth, conceives of earth as ‘me’, and delights in earth. For what reason? ‘A lack of complete understanding,’ I say.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Such a one perceives water as water… fire as fire… wind as wind… devas as devas… Pajāpati<sup>1</sup> as Pajāpati… Brahma as Brahma… ābhassara<sup>2</sup> devas as ābhassara devas… vehapphala<sup>3</sup> devas as vehapphala devas… a higher being<sup>4</sup> as a higher being… the dimension of infinite space as the dimension of infinite space… the dimension of infinite consciousness as the dimension of infinite consciousness… the dimension of nothingness as the dimension of nothingness… the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception as the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception… the seen as the seen… the heard as the heard… the sensed as the sensed… the cognized as the cognized… unity as unity… variety as variety… all as all… Nibbāna as Nibbāna.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Monks, a monk who is a trainee – one who has not yet achieved his purpose, who is still yearning for unsurpassable safety<sup>5</sup> – understands earth as earth.
