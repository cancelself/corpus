<h1 class='sutta-title'>17. The Discourse on the Wilderness Grove</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, at Jeta‘s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. There the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks!” “Auspicious sir,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this: “Monks, I will teach you a discourse about wilderness groves. Listen to this and carefully pay attention; I will speak.” “Yes, Bhante,” those monks replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>“Monks, here a monk lives in a particular wilderness grove. While living in that wilderness grove, his unestablished mindfulness does not become established, his unconcentrated mind does not become concentrated, his uneliminated corruptions do not become eliminated, and the unsurpassable security from limitation which he has not attained is not being attained. And the basic necessities of life which he needs to procure – robes, almsfood, dwelling-places, medicines and medical supplies – are difficult to obtain. Monks, that monk is to reflect, ‘I am living in this wilderness grove. While I am living here, my unestablished mindfulness does not become established, my unconcentrated mind does not become concentrated, my uneliminated corruptions do not become eliminated, and the unsurpassable security from limitation which I have not attained is not being attained. And the basic necessities of life which I need to procure – robes, almsfood, dwelling-places, medicines and medical supplies – are difficult to obtain.’ Monks, that monk is to leave that wilderness grove that very day or that very night; he is not to live there.</p>

And the basic necessities of life which I need to procure – robes, almsfood, dwelling-places, medicines and medical supplies – are easy to obtain. However, I did not leave the household life for the sake of robes… almsfood… dwelling-places… medicines and medical supplies. And while I am living this wilderness grove, my unestablished mindfulness does not become established, my unconcentrated mind does not become concentrated, my uneliminated corruptions do not become eliminated, and the unsurpassable security from limitation which I have not attained is not being attained.’ Monks, after consideration, that monk is to leave that wilderness grove; he is not to live there.</p>
