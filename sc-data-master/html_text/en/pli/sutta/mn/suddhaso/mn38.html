</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthi, at Jeta‘s Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika‘s Park. Now on this occasion this kind of harmful perspective had arisen in the mind of a monk named Sāti the Fisherman‘s Son: “As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is this very consciousness which wanders in Saṁsāra, and nothing else.” Many monks heard: “It seems that this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in the mind of Sāti the Fisherman‘s Son: ‘As I understand… and nothing else.’” Then those monks approached Sāti Bhikkhu and said to him, “Venerable Sāti, is it true that this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in you: ‘As I understand… and nothing else’?” “Venerable, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Saṁsāra, and nothing else.” Then those monks, wishing to detach Sāti Bhikkhu from that harmful perspective, questioned, cross-examined, and interrogated him: “Venerable Sāti, don‘t speak in that way. Don‘t misrepresent the Blessed One. It is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. Venerable Sāti, consciousness has been spoken of in many ways by the Blessed One as conditionally arisen<sup>1</sup>. Consciousness does not exist apart from its cause<sup>2</sup>.” While Sāti Bhikkhu was being questioned, cross-examined, and interrogated in this way by those monks, he firmly held to that same harmful perspective, and persistently stated, “Venerable, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Saṁsāra, and nothing else.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>When those monks were unable to detach Sāti Bhikkhu from that harmful perspective, they approached the Blessed One. After approaching and venerating the Blessed One, they sat to one side. While they were seated to one side, those monks said to the Blessed One, “Bhante, this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in the mind of a monk named Sāti the Fisherman‘s Son: ‘As I understand… and nothing else.’ Bhante, we heard that this kind of harmful perspective had arisen in mind of Sati Bhikkhu: ‘As I understand… and nothing else.’ Then we approached Sāti Bhikkhu and said to him, ‘Venerable Sāti, is it true that this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in you: “As I understand… and nothing else”?’ Bhante, when this was said, Sāti Bhikkhu said to us, ‘Venerable, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Saṁsāra, and nothing else.’ Bhante, wishing to detach Sāti Bhikkhu from that harmful perspective, we then questioned, cross-examined, and interrogated him: ‘Venerable Sāti, don‘t speak in that way… Consciousness does not exist apart from its cause.’ Bhante, while Sāti Bhikkhu was being questioned, cross-examined, and interrogated by us in this way, he firmly held to that same harmful perspective, and persistently stated, ‘Venerable, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Saṁsāra, and nothing else.’ Bhante, when we were unable to detach Sāti Bhikkhu from that harmful perspective, we reported this matter to the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>Then the Blessed One addressed a certain monk: “Monk, go and summon Sāti Bhikkhu with my words: ‘Venerable Sāti, the Teacher summons you.’” “Yes, Bhante,” that monk replied the Blessed One. He approached Sāti Bhikkhu and said to him, “Venerable Sāti, the Teacher summons you.” “Yes, Venerable,” Sāti Bhikkhu replied to that monk, and approached the Blessed One. After approaching and venerating the Blessed One, he sat to one side. When Sāti Bhikkhu was seated to one side, the Blessed One said to him, “Sāti, is it true that this kind of harmful perspective has arisen in you: ‘As I understand… and nothing else’?” “Bhante, it is in this way that I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One: It is this very consciousness which wanders in Saṁsāra, and nothing else.” “Sāti, what is that consciousness?” “Bhante, it is what speaks and feels; it is what experiences in various ways the results of good and bad actions.” “Foolish man<sup>3</sup>, for whom do you recall the Dhamma having been taught by me in that way? Foolish man, haven‘t I spoken of consciousness in many ways as conditionally arisen, <span class='add'>and that</span> consciousness does not exist apart from its cause? Foolish man, you misrepresent me using your own wrongly held <span class='add'>opinion</span>. You damage yourself<sup>4</sup> and accumulate much demerit. Foolish man, this will lead to your long-term detriment and suffering.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, what do you think: has Sāti Bhikkhu kindled even a spark <span class='add'>of understanding</span> in this Dhamma-Vinaya?” “How could it be so, Bhante? Certainly not, Bhante.” When this was said, Sāti Bhikkhu sat silent, ashamed, slouching, face downcast, sullen, unresponsive. Then when the Blessed One knew that Sāti Bhikkhu was silent, ashamed, slouching, face downcast, sullen, and unresponsive, he said to Sāti Bhikkhu, “Foolish man, you will be known by your own harmful perspective. I will question the <span class='add'>other</span> monks about this.” Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, do you recall the Dhamma having been taught by me in the way that Sāti Bhikkhu misrepresents me using his own wrongly held <span class='add'>opinion</span>, damaging himself and accumulating much demerit?” “Certainly not, Bhante! Bhante, the Blessed One has spoken to us in many ways of consciousness as conditionally arisen, <span class='add'>and that</span> consciousness does not exist apart from its cause.” “Good, good, monks! Monks, it is good that you recall the Dhamma as having been taught by me in that way. Monks, I have spoken to you in many ways of consciousness as conditionally arisen, <span class='add'>and that</span> consciousness does not exist apart from its cause. However, Sāti Bhikkhu misrepresents me using his own wrongly held <span class='add'>opinion</span>, damaging himself and accumulating much demerit. This will lead to that foolish man‘s long-term detriment and suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“Monks, whatever condition consciousness arises in dependence on, it is in terms of that that it is defined as ‘consciousness.’ When consciousness arises in dependence on an eye and visual objects, it is defined as ‘eye-consciousness.’ When consciousness arises in dependence on an ear and sounds, it is defined as ‘ear-consciousness.’ When consciousness arises in dependence on a nose and fragrances, it is defined as ‘nose-consciousness.’ When consciousness arises in dependence on a tongue and flavors, it is defined as ‘tongue-consciousness.’ When consciousness arises in dependence on a body and tangible objects, it is defined as ‘body-consciousness.’ When consciousness arises in dependence on a mind and mental objects, it is defined as ‘mind-consciousness.’</p>

He abstains from running errands and carrying messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from false scales, false weights, and false measuring devices.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc80' href='#sc80'>SC 80</a>“He is content with a robe to take care of his body and alms-food to take care of his stomach. Wherever he goes, he goes with only these. Just as wherever a winged bird goes, it goes weighed down only by its feathers, in the same way a monk is content with a robe to take care of his body and alms-food to take care of his stomach. Wherever he goes, he goes with only these. Endowed with this noble collection of virtues, he experiences the internal happiness of blamelessness.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc81' href='#sc81'>SC 81</a>“When he sees a visible object with the eye, he does not grasp at its characteristics or details. When one lives with the eye-faculty unrestrained, harmful, unskillful mindstates of covetousness and dejection might invade the mind; therefore, he practices restraint, guards the eye-faculty, and attains restraint in the eye-faculty. When he hears a sound with the ear… smells a fragrance with the nose… tastes a flavor with the tongue… touches a tangible object with the body… cognizes a thought with the mind, he does not grasp at its characteristics or details. When one lives with the mind-faculty unrestrained, harmful, unskillful mindstates of covetousness and dejection might invade the mind; therefore, he practices restraint, guards the eye-faculty, and attains restraint in the mind-faculty. Endowed with this noble sense-restraint, he experiences the internal happiness of impeccability<sup>23</sup>.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc82' href='#sc82'>SC 82</a>“He is completely aware while advancing or retreating. He is completely aware while looking forward or backward. He is completely aware while contracting or extending <span class='add'>his limbs</span>. He is completely aware while carrying his cloak, robe, and bowl. He is completely aware while eating, drinking, consuming, and tasting. He is completely aware while defecating and urinating. He is completely aware while moving, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, speaking, and remaining silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc83' href='#sc83'>SC 83</a>“Endowed with this collection of noble virtues, this noble sense-restraint, and this noble mindfulness and complete awareness, he resorts to secluded dwelling<sup>24</sup> places – a forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a gully, a hill-cave, a cemetery, an isolated grove, the open air, a heap of straw. When he returns from alms-round after his meal, he sits down in a cross-legged position with his body upright and establishes mindfulness as foremost. He abandons covetousness in regard to the world, and abides with a mind free of covetousness; he purifies his mind of covetousness. He abandons aversion and hatred, and abides with a mind free of aversion; he wishes for the welfare of all living beings, and purifies his mind of aversion and hatred. He abandons dullness and torpor, and abides free of dullness and torpor, percipient of light; mindful and completely aware, he purifies his mind of dullness and torpor. He abandons restlessness and remorse, and abides unagitated, with a mind that is internally peaceful; he purifies his mind of restlessness and remorse. He abandons doubt, and abides as one who has gone beyond doubt, who is free of confusion about skillful phenomena; he purifies the mind of doubt.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc84' href='#sc84'>SC 84</a>“When he has abandoned these five hindrances – defilements of the mind that weaken wisdom – then, secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful phenomena, he attains and remains in the first <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i><sup>25</sup>, which has thought and consideration, and has rapture and pleasure produced by seclusion. With the calming of thought and consideration, and with internal composure and mental focus, he attains and remains in the second <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, which is free of thought and free of consideration, and has rapture and pleasure born from concentration. With the fading away of rapture, Sāriputta remains equanimous, mindful, and clearly comprehending, and experiences pleasure with the body; he attains and remains in the third <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna,</i> which the noble ones describe as ‘Equanimous, mindful, and dwelling happily.’ With the abandoning of pleasure, the abandoning of pain, and the prior disappearance of elation and depression, Sāriputta attains and remains in the fourth <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i>, which has neither pain nor pleasure, and has purity due to mindfulness and equanimity.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc85' href='#sc85'>SC 85</a>“When he sees a visible object with the eye, if it is an agreeable object he does not become infatuated with it, and if it is a disagreeable object he does not become averse it; he abides with mindfulness of the body established and with an immeasurable<sup>26</sup> mind. He accurately understands that liberation of mind and liberation by wisdom where those harmful, unskillful phenomena cease without remainder. When he has abandoned approval and opposition in this way, then whatever feeling he feels – pleasant, painful, or neutral – he does not delight in that feeling, he does not welcome it, and he does not adhere to it. Since he does not delight in, welcome, or adhere to that feeling, then delight in regard to feelings ceases. From the cessation of his delight there is the cessation of clinging. From the cessation of clinging there is the cessation of existence. From the cessation of existence there is the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth there is the cessation of old age and dieing; and sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish cease. In this way there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc86' href='#sc86'>SC 86</a>“When he hears a sound with the ear… smells a fragrance with the nose… tastes a flavor with the tongue… touches a tangible object with the body… cognizes a thought with the mind, if it is an agreeable object he does not become infatuated with it… In this way there is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc87' href='#sc87'>SC 87</a>“Monks, remember this as liberation by means of the complete elimination of craving, that has been briefly <span class='add'>explained</span> by me. However, Sāti Bhikkhu is not free from a tangled mass of craving, from the net of craving.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc88' href='#sc88'>SC 88</a>This is what the Blessed One said. Satisfied, those monks delighted in the Blessed One‘s speech.</p>
