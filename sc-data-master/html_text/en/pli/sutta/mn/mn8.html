<h1>8. Effacement</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard</span>. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a>Then, when it was evening, the venerable Mahā Cunda rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side and said to him:</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a>“Venerable sir, various views arise in the world associated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world. Now does the abandoning and relinquishing of those views come about in a bhikkhu who is attending only to the beginning <span class='add'>of his meditative training</span>?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>“Cunda, as to those various views that arise in the world associated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world: if <span class='add'>the object</span> in relation to which those views arise, which they underlie, and which they are exercised upon is seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ then the abandoning and relinquishing of those views comes about.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>The Eight Attainments</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc5' href='#sc5'>SC 5</a>“It is possible here, Cunda, that quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement. ’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One’s Discipline: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='mn.i.41' href='#mn.i.41'>mn.i.41</a> in the Noble One’s Discipline.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc6' href='#sc6'>SC 6</a>“It is possible here that with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhāna, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But…these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc7' href='#sc7'>SC 7</a>“It is possible here that with the fading away as well of rapture, some bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhāna, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But…these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc8' href='#sc8'>SC 8</a>“It is possible here that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One’s Discipline: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc9' href='#sc9'>SC 9</a>“It is possible here that with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One’s Discipline: these are called ‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc10' href='#sc10'>SC 10</a>“It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But…these are called ‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One’s Discipline.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc11' href='#sc11'>SC 11</a>“It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness.

<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc12' href='#sc12'>SC 12</a>“It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.

<h2><span class='add'>Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc115' href='#sc115'>SC 115</a>“So, Cunda, the way of effacement has been taught by me, the way of inclining the mind has been taught by me, the way of avoidance has been taught by me, the way leading upwards has been taught by me, and the way of extinguishing has been taught by me.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc116' href='#sc116'>SC 116</a>“What should be done for his disciples out of compassion by a teacher who seeks their welfare and has compassion for them, that I have done for you, Cunda. There are these roots of trees, these empty huts. Meditate, Cunda, do not delay or else you will regret it later. This is our instruction to you.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc117' href='#sc117'>SC 117</a>That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Mahā Cunda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</p>
