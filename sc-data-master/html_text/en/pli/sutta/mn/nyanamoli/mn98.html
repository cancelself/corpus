<h1>98. To Vāseṭṭha</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard</span>:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Icchānaṅgala, in the wood near Icchānaṅgala.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya2' href='#nya2'>Nya 2</a>Now on that occasion very many well-known divines were staying at Icchānaṅgala, that is to say, Caṅkī the divine, Tārukkha the divine, Pokkharasāti the divine, Janussoni the divine, Todeyya the divine, and other very well-known divines, great property owners.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya3' href='#nya3'>Nya 3</a>Then while the student <span class='add'>divines</span> Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were walking and wandering for exercise, it was being debated between them thus:</p>
<p>“Sir, how is one a divine?”</p>
<p>The student <span class='add'>divine</span> Bhāradvāja said: “Sir, when one is well-born on both sides with a pure pedigree as far as the seventh generation back through the mother and through the father, unsullied and unquestioned in the matter of breeding, that is how one is a divine.”</p>
<p>The student <span class='add'>divine</span> Vāseṭṭha said: “Sir, when one is virtuous and has perfected the duties, that is how one is a divine.”</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya4' href='#nya4'>Nya 4</a>But neither could the student <span class='add'>divine</span> Bhāradvāja make the student <span class='add'>divine</span> Vāseṭṭha perceive, nor could the student <span class='add'>divine</span> Vāseṭṭha make the student <span class='add'>divine</span> Bhāradvāja perceive.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya5' href='#nya5'>Nya 5</a>Then the student <span class='add'>divine</span> Vāseṭṭha said to the other Bhāradvāja: “There is the monk Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, living at Icchānaṅgala, in the wood near Icchānaṅgala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is such since he is Arahant and Fully Enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable teacher of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened, blessed.’ Let us go to him and ask him the meaning of this and let us remember it according to what he says.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” the other replied.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya6' href='#nya6'>Nya 6</a>Then the two student <span class='add'>divines</span> went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him, and when the courteous and amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side. When they had done so, the student <span class='add'>divine</span> Vāseṭṭha addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya7' href='#nya7'>Nya 7</a>“We are both conceded, and we claim,<br>
Full knowledge of the Triple Veda<br>
For I am Pokkharasāti’s pupil;<br>
And he was taught by Tārukkha.</p>
<p>“We have attained totality<br>
In all Three-Veda experts tell;<br>
Word-perfect in replies, we match<br>
Our teachers’ dialectic skill.</p>
<p>“Now, Gotama, between us two<br>
Birth is a subject of dispute<br>
Know then, O Seer, that Bhāradvāja<br>
Considers a divine is such<br>
Owing to birth, but I instead<br>
Maintain that it is by his acts.</p>
<p>“Since neither of us so far<br>
Can get the other to perceive<br>
<span class='add'>His point of view</span>, we come to ask<br>
One famed for Full Enlightenment.</p>
<p>“For Gotama is like the moon<br>
To whom men turn with palms upraised<br>
And bow in reverence each month<br>
For compensating the past wane.</p>
<p>“So now we ask of Gotama,<br>
The Eye uprisen in the world:<br>
How should we recognize divines:<br>
Or by their birth or their acts?<br>
Explain to us who know it not<br>
How we should recognize divines.”</p>
<p>“I give you then in order due,<br>
Vāseṭṭha,” said the Blessed One<br>
“According to reality<br>
The scheme of birth of breathing things<br>
For many are the kinds of birth.</p>
<p>“Know <span class='add'>first</span> the grass and trees; although<br>
They lack knowledge <span class='add'>and consciousness</span>:<br>
Their birth is their distinctive mark;<br>
For many are the kinds of birth.</p>
<p>“Next come the moths and butterflies<br>
And so on down as far as ants:<br>
Their birth is their distinctive mark;<br>
For many are the kinds of birth.</p>
<p>“Then know the kinds of quadrupeds<br>
<span class='add'>Of varied sorts</span> both small and large:<br>
Their birth is their distinctive mark;<br>
For many are the kinds of birth.</p>
<p>“Know those whose bellies are their feet,<br>
To wit, the long-backed serpent <span class='add'>tribe</span>:<br>
Their birth is their distinctive mark;<br>
For many are the kinds of birth.</p>
<p>“Know too the water-dwelling fish<br>
That pasture in the liquid world:<br>
Their birth is their distinctive mark;<br>
For many are the kinds of birth.</p>
<p>“Next know the birds that wing their way<br>
With feathers as they range in space:</p>
Their birth is their distinctive mark;<br>
For many are the kinds of birth.</p>
<p>“While in these births the differences<br>
Of birth make their distinctive mark,<br>
With men instead no differences<br>
Of birth make a distinctive mark.</p>
<p>“Nor in the hairs nor in the head<br>
Nor in the ears nor in the eyes<br>
Nor in the mouth nor in the nose<br>
Nor in the lips nor in the brows.</p>
<p>“Nor in the shoulders or the neck<br>
Nor in the belly or the back<br>
Nor in the buttocks or the breast<br>
Nor in the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>“Nor in the hands nor in the feet<br>
Nor in the fingers or the nails<br>
Nor in the knees nor in the thighs<br>
Nor in appearance or in voice:<br>
Here birth makes no distinctive mark<br>
As with the different kinds of birth.</p>
<p>“In human bodies in themselves<br>
No such <span class='add'>distinction</span> can be found<br>
And that which constitutes their kind<br>
Is called the sameness among men.</p>
<p>“Who makes his living among men<br>
By agriculture, you well know,<br>
Vāseṭṭha, is a farmer called,<br>
Not by that is he a divine.</p>
<p>“Who makes his living among men<br>
By varied craftsmanship, you know,<br>
Vāseṭṭha, is a craftsman called,<br>
Not by that is he a divine.</p>
<p>“Who makes his living among men<br>
By merchandise, as you well know,<br>
Vāseṭṭha, is a merchant called,<br>
Not by that is he a divine.</p>
<p>“Who makes his living among men<br>
By serving others, you well know,<br>
Vāseṭṭha, is a servant called,<br>
Not by that is he a divine.</p>
<p>“Who makes his living among men<br>
By the ungiven, you well know,<br>
Vāseṭṭha, is a robber called,<br>
Not by that is he a divine.</p>
<p>“Who makes his living among men<br>
By archery, as you well know,<br>
Vāseṭṭha, is a soldier called,<br>
Not by that is he a divine.</p>
<p>“Who makes his living among men<br>
By priestly craft, as you well know,<br>
Vāseṭṭha, is a chaplain called,<br>
Not by that is he a divine.</p>
<p>“Whoever governs among men<br>
The town and realm, as you well know,<br>
Vāseṭṭha, is a ruler called,<br>
Not by that is he a divine.</p>
<p>“I call not him divine who claims<br>
Womb-born maternal lineage;<br>
If ‘owning’ holds him still, he is<br>
Just one who uses the word ‘sir’.<br>
Who owns no more and clings no more<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“When every fetter has been cut<br>
He knows no anguish any more,<br>
With passion overcome, detached:<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“When, having cut each strap and trace<br>
And rein and bridle-band <span class='add'>as well</span>,<br>
His shaft being lifted, he is wakened:<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“And one who suffers with no hate,<br>
Abuse and even torturing,<br>
With strength of patience well arrayed<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“One who, unangry, dutiful,<br>
Virtuous, unassuming too,<br>
Subdued, is bearing his last body,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who, like the rain on lotus leaves,<br>
Or mustard seed on the point of an awl,<br>
Clings not at all to sense desires,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who knows right here and in himself<br>
Exhaustion of <span class='add'>all</span> suffering.<br>
With burden lowered, and detached,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who with deep understanding, wise,<br>
Can tell the Path from the not-path<br>
And has attained the goal supreme,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Aloof alike from laity<br>
And those gone into homelessness,<br>
He wanders without home or wish<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who lays aside the rod <span class='add'>at last</span><br>
Against all beings frail or bold,<br>
And kills them not nor has them killed,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who, mid opponents unopposed,<br>
Is quenched among rod-brandishers,<br>
Uncling among those who cling,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who drops his lust and drops his hate<br>
And his conceit and his contempt,<br>
Like mustard seed on the point of an awl,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who utters speech, which, never hard,<br>
Is ever sensible and true<br>
And cannot damage anyone,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who in the world will never take<br>
What is not given, long or short<br>
Or small or big or fair or foul,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who has no more existing needs<br>
Regarding this world and the next,<br>
Who lives unneeding and detached,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who has no more reliance too,<br>
And no more questions, since he knows<br>
Through having reached the Deathless Sphere,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who, by outstripping passion here<br>
About both merit and misdeeds,<br>
Is sorrowless, unsullied, pure,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who, pure as the spotless moon,<br>
Is clear and limpid, and in whom<br>
Delight and Being are used up,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who has got through the slough, the mire<br>
The round <span class='add'>of births</span>, deludedness,<br>
Has crossed, gone to the further shore<br>
And has illumination too,<br>
Is unperturbed, unquestioning<br>
And quenched with lack of clinging’s fuel,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who has abandoned sense desires<br>
And wanders here in homelessness<br>
With sense desires and being used up,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who has abandoned craving too,<br>
And wanders here in homelessness<br>
With craving too, and being used up,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who leaves behind <span class='add'>all</span> human bonds<br>
And has outstripped the bonds of heaven,<br>
Detached from all the bonds there are,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Cooled, he leaves delight and boredom<br>
He has no essentials of existence,<br>
A hero, the whole world transcending:<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who knows how clutching creatures die<br>
To reappear in many a mode,<br>
Unclutching he, sublime, awake,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Whose destination is unknown<br>
To gods, to spirits and to men,<br>
An Arahant, with exhausted taints<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Whom owning past, or future, or<br>
Between, no longer holds at all,<br>
Who owns no more and clings no more,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“The herd’s leader, perfected hero<br>
Seeker whose victory is won,<br>
<span class='add'>Now</span> unperturbed, bathed and awake:<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“Who knows his manifold past life;<br>
And sees the heavens and states of loss,<br>
And finds exhaustion of all birth,<br>
Of him I use the word ‘divine’.</p>
<p>“For name and lineage as conjectured<br>
Are <span class='add'>just</span> a usage in the world<br>
That in conventions has its source:<br>
Conjecture <span class='add'>applies them</span> here and there.</p>
<p>“Men know not this because wrong views<br>
For long have underlain their <span class='add'>hearts</span>,<br>
And they, unknowing <span class='add'>of the truth</span>,<br>
Tells us ‘Man is divine by birth’.</p>
<p>“A man is not divine by birth<br>
Nor is he undivine by birth:<br>
A man by actions is divine,<br>
By action he is undivine.</p>
<p>“For men are farmers by their acts,<br>
And by their acts are craftsmen too;<br>
And men are merchants by their acts,<br>
And by their acts are servants too.</p>
<p>“And men are robbers by their acts,<br>
And by their acts are soldiers too<br>
And men are chaplains by their acts,<br>
And by their acts are rulers too.</p>
<p>“So that is how the <span class='add'>truly</span> wise,<br>
Seeing Dependent Origin<br>
And skilled in actions’ ripening,<br>
See action as it <span class='add'>really</span> is.</p>
<p>“Tis action makes the world go round<br>
As action makes this generation;<br>
Since action clutching-creatures locks<br>
As linch-pins rolling chariot <span class='add'>wheels</span>.</p>
<p>“Asceticism, Life divine,<br>
And self-subduing, and restraint:<br>
By these a man becomes divine,<br>
In these supreme divineness lies.</p>
<p>“The sages’ Divinity, Vāseṭṭha,<br>
Their Ruler of Gods, as you well know,<br>
Is One with the Triple Knowledge True<br>
Quieted, renewing no more his being.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When this was said, the students <span class='add'>divines</span> Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One: “Magnificent, Master Gotama, sir! Magnificent, Master Gotama, sir! The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master Gotama, as though he were righting the overthrown, revealing the hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, holding up a lamp in the darkness for those with eyesight to see forms.</p>
<p>“We go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma and to the Sangha. From today let Master Gotama remember us as followers who have gone to him for refuge for life.”</p>
