<h1>34. The Cowherd 2</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard</span>:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Vajjian country at Ukkācelā on the banks of the River Ganges. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya2' href='#nya2'>Nya 2</a>“Bhikkhus, there was once a Magadhan herdsman who by nature lacked understanding and in the last month of the Rains, in the Autumn time, omitting to examine the near shore of the Ganges River or its further shore, he drove his cattle in where there was no ford to cross over to the other shore here in the Videhan country. Then the cattle bunched together in mid-stream in the Ganges River, and they came to disaster. Why was that? Because the Magadhan herdsman by nature lacked understanding, and in the last month of the Rains, in the Autumn time, omitting to examine the near shore of the Ganges River or its further shore, he drove his cattle in where there was no ford to cross over to the other shore in the Videhan country.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya3' href='#nya3'>Nya 3</a>“So too, when monks or divines are unskilled in this world and the other world, unskilled in what belongs to Māra and what does not belong to him, and unskilled in what belongs to Death and what does not belong to him, it will be long for the harm and suffering of those who shall conceive them as fit to be heard and fit to place faith in.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya4' href='#nya4'>Nya 4</a>“Bhikkhus, there was once a Magadhan herdsman who by nature had understanding and in the last month of the Rains, in the Autumn time, after examining the near shore of the Ganges River and its further shore, he drove his cattle in where there was a ford to cross over to the other shore in the Videhan country. He made the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd, cross over first, and they breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore. He made the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed cross over next, and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore. He made the heifers and young oxen cross over next, and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore. He made the calves and the feeble cattle cross over next, and they too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to the further shore. There was once a tender calf just born, and being urged on by the mother’s lowing, he too breasted the stream of the Ganges and got safely across to further shore. Why was that? Because the Magadhan herdsman by nature had understanding, and in the last month of the Rains, in the Autumn time, after examining the near shore of the Ganges River and its further shore, he drove his cattle in where there was a ford to cross over to the other shore here in the Videhan country.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya5' href='#nya5'>Nya 5</a>“So too, when monks or divines are skilled in this world and the other world, skilled in what belongs to Māra and what does not belong to him, skilled in what belongs to Death and what does not belong to him, it will be long for the welfare and happiness of those who shall conceive them as fit to be heard and fit to place faith in.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya6' href='#nya6'>Nya 6</a>“Bhikkhus, just as the bulls, the fathers and leaders of the herd, breasted the Ganges’ stream and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who are Arahants, with taints exhausted, who have lived the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, reached the highest goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and through right final knowledge are liberated, have, by breasting Māra’s stream, got safely across to the further shore.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya7' href='#nya7'>Nya 7</a>“Just as the strong cattle and the cattle to be tamed breasted the Ganges’ stream and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who with the destruction of the five lower fetters will reappear spontaneously <span class='add'>in the Pure Abodes</span> and there attain Nibbāna without ever returning from that world, will also, by breasting Māra’s stream, get safely across to the further shore.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya8' href='#nya8'>Nya 8</a>“Just as the heifers and young oxen breasted the Ganges’ stream and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who with the destruction of three fetters and with attenuation of lust, hate and delusion, are once-returners, returning once to this world to make an end of suffering, will also, by breasting Māra’s stream, get safely across to the further shore.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya9' href='#nya9'>Nya 9</a>“Just as the calves and the feeble cattle also breasted the Ganges’ stream and got safely across to the further shore, so too, those bhikkhus who with the destruction of three fetters are stream-enterers, no longer subject to perdition, certain <span class='add'>of rightness</span>, and headed for full enlightenment, will also, by breasting Māra’s stream, get safely across to the further shore.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya10' href='#nya10'>Nya 10</a>“Just as that tender calf just born which being urged on by the mother’s lowing, also breasted the Ganges’ stream and got safely across to the further shore, so too, these bhikkhus who are mature in the Dhamma, mature in faith, will also by breasting Māra’s stream, get safely across to the further shore.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya11' href='#nya11'>Nya 11</a>“Bhikkhus, I am skilled in this world and the next world, skilled in what belongs to Māra and what does not belong to him, and skilled in what belongs to Death and what does not belong to him. It will be long for the welfare and happiness of those who shall conceive me as fit to be heard and fit to place faith in.”</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya12' href='#nya12'>Nya 12</a>This is what the Blessed One said. When the Sublime One had said that, the Master said further:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Both this world and the world beyond<br>
Are well described by He that knows,<br>
And what is still in Māra’s reach<br>
And what is out of reach of Death.<br>
Knowing directly all the world,<br>
The Wakened One who understands<br>
Opened the Deathless Gate, whereby<br>
Nibbāna may be safely reached;<br>
For Māra’s stream is breasted <span class='add'>now</span><br>
And nullified, its reeds removed;<br>
Rejoice then, bhikkhus, mightily<br>
And set your hearts where safety lies.”</p>
