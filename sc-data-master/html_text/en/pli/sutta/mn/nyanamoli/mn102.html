<h1>102. The Five and Three</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus I heard</span>:</p>
<p>On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi, in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>
<p>“Bhikkhus.”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
<h3>Based on Future Finiteness</h3>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya2' href='#nya2'>Nya 2</a>“Bhikkhus, there are some monks and divines, who, conjecturing about future finiteness and holding views about future finiteness, affirm various assertions contingent upon future finiteness.</p>
<p>(i) “Some affirm such <span class='add'>assertion</span> as this: ‘The percipient self is intact after death.’</p>
<p>(ii) “Some affirm such <span class='add'>assertion</span> as this: ‘The non-percipient self is intact after death.’</p>
<p>(iii) “Some affirm such <span class='add'>assertion</span> as this: ‘The neither-pecipient-nor-non-percipient self is intact after death.’</p>
<p>(iv) “Or they describe an existing being’s <span class='add'>eventual</span> annihilation, obliteration and non-being.</p>
<p>(v) “Then some affirm <span class='add'>the assertion of</span> ‘Nibbāna’ here and now.</p>
<p>“Thus (a) they either describe an existing being to be intact after death, or (b) they describe an existing being’s <span class='add'>eventual</span> annihilation, obliteration and non-being, or (c) they affirm <span class='add'>the assertion of</span> ‘Nibbāna’ here and now. So these five are three, and these three are five.</p>
<p>“This is the summary of the Five and Three.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya3' href='#nya3'>Nya 3</a>(i) “Here, bhikkhus, when monks and divines describe a percipient self intact after death, then those good monks and divines describe the percipient self intact after death to be:</p>

<p>or 3. possessed of form and formless,</p>
<p>or 4. neither possessed of form nor formless,</p>
<p>or 5. percipient of unity,</p>
<p>or 6. percipient of difference,</p>
<p>or 7. percipient of the limited,</p>
<p>or 8. percipient of the measureless.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya4' href='#nya4'>Nya 4</a>“Or else while those just mentioned affirm thus, <span class='add'>some</span> others <span class='add'>similarly</span> affirm <span class='add'>assertions about</span> consciousness as the absolute, measureless and imperturbable, which goes beyond that of those <span class='add'>first mentioned</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya5' href='#nya5'>Nya 5</a>“Bhikkhus, a Tathāgata understands <span class='add'>the whole of</span> that thus: ‘When monks and divines describe the percipient self to be intact after death, then those good monks and divines describe the percipient self intact after death to be (1) possessed of form… <span class='add'>(as in para. 3)</span>… (8) percipient of the measureless. Or else some <span class='add'>others</span> affirm <span class='add'>assertions about perception of</span> the base consisting of nothingness thus: “There is nothing”, as measureless and imperturbable, which <span class='add'>perception</span> is declared <span class='add'>by them</span> the purest, most perfect, most high, most unsurpassable, of those <span class='add'>kinds of</span> perceptions, whether perceptions of form or perceptions of the formless or perceptions of unity or perceptions of difference. <span class='add'>Now the whole of</span> that is conditioned and <span class='add'>thus</span> gross; but there is cessation of formations, there is that.’ By knowing thus and by seeing the escape from <span class='add'>all</span> that, a Tathāgata goes beyond <span class='add'>all</span> that.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya6' href='#nya6'>Nya 6</a>(ii) “Here bhikkhus, when monks and divines describe the non-percipient self to be intact after death, then those good monks and divines describe the non-percipient self intact after death to be:</p>

<p>or 3. possessed of form and formless,</p>
<p>or 4. neither possessed of form nor formless.</p>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya7' href='#nya7'>Nya 7</a>“Here these oppose those good monks and divines who describe the percipient self intact after death.

<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya9' href='#nya9'>Nya 9</a>(iii) “Here, bhikkhus, when monks and divines describe the neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient self to be intact after death, then those good monks and divines describe the neither-percipient-nor-non-percipient self intact after death to be:</p>

<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya27' href='#nya27'>Nya 27</a>“Bhikkhus, the supreme state of peace that is unsurpassable has been discovered by a Tathāgata, that is to say, liberation through not clinging, by knowing as they are the origination, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger and the escape, <span class='add'>in the case</span> of the six bases for contact.</p>
