<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the venerable Ānanda, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe entered Sāvatthī for almsfood. When he had walked for almsfood in Sāvatthī, returning from the alms-gathering after the meal, he approached the palace of Migāra's mother and the eastern <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en297' href='#pts-vp-en297'>PTS vp En 297</a> monastery for the day-sojourn. At that time King Pasenadi of Kosala, having mounted the bull-elephant Ekapuṇḍarika (One-Lotus), set forth from Sāvatthī in the early morning. King Pasenadi saw the venerable Ānanda coming in the distance; seeing him, he addressed the chief minister, Sirivaḍḍha, saying: “Dear Sirivaḍḍha, is not this the venerable Ānanda?” “Yes, sire, this is the venerable Ānanda.” Then King Pasenadi addressed another man, saying: “Come you, my good man, approach the venerable Ānanda; in my name salute the venerable Ānanda's feet with your head, saying: ‘Revered sir, King Pasenadi salutes the venerable Ānanda's feet with his head,’ and then say: ‘If, revered sir, there is really nothing urgent to be done by the venerable Ānanda, please, revered sir, let the venerable Ānanda wait for a moment out of compassion.’” “Yes, sire,” and this man having answered King Pasenadi in assent, approached the venerable Ānanda; having approached and having greeted the venerable Ānanda, he stood at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>As this man was standing at a respectful distance, he spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “Revered sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala salutes the venerable Ānanda's feet with his head, and speaks thus: ‘If, revered sir, there is really nothing urgent to be done by the venerable Ānanda, please, revered sir, let the venerable Ānanda wait for a moment out of compassion.’” The venerable Ānanda consented by becoming silent. Then King Pasenadi, having gone by the bull-elephant as far as the ground was possible for the elephant, having dismounted, approached the venerable Ānanda on foot; having approached, having greeted the venerable Ānanda, he stood at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>As he was standing at a respectful distance, King Pasenadi spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “If, revered sir, there is nothing urgent to be done by the venerable Ānanda, it were good, revered sir, that the venerable Ānanda should approach the bank of the river <i>Aciravatī</i> out of compassion.” And the venerable Ānanda consented by becoming silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then the venerable Ānanda approached the bank of the river Aciravatī; having approached, he sat down on a seat made ready at the root of a tree. Then King Pasenadi, having gone by bull-elephant as far as the ground was possible for the elephant, having dismounted, approached the venerable Ānanda on foot; having approached, having greeted the venerable Ānanda, he stood at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>As he was standing at a respectful distance, King Pasenadi spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “Now, revered sir, let the venerable Ānanda sit down on this elephant-rug.” <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en298' href='#pts-vp-en298'>PTS vp En 298</a> “No, sire; you sit down, I am sitting on a seat of my own.” King Pasenadi sat down on the prepared seat.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>As King Pasenadi was sitting down, he spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “Revered Ānanda, would the Lord engage not in such bodily conduct as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans?” “No, sire, the Lord would not engage in such bodily conduct as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.” “But, revered Ānanda, would the Lord engage not in such conduct of speech as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.” “No, sire, the Lord would not engage in such conduct of speech as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.” “But, revered Ānanda, would the Lord engage not in such conduct of thought as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.” “No, sire, the Lord would not engage in such conduct of thought as was offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.” “It is wonderful, revered sir, it is marvellous, revered sir, what I was not able to convey fully in a question has been, revered sir, fully conveyed by the venerable Ānanda in answer to the question. <span class='note' hidden=''>bd: There seems to be some corruption in the text here, as the questions and answers seem to match.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>Revered sir, when those who are ignorant and inexperienced speak in praise or dispraise of others without test or scrutiny, we do not fall back on that as the pith (of the matter). But, revered sir, when those who are wise, experienced, clever, speak in praise or dispraise of others after test and scrutiny, we fall back on that as the pith (of the matter).<span class='note' hidden=''>bd: There seems to be some corruption in the text here, as this false teaching on praise is not questioned.</span> But what, revered Ānanda, is the bodily conduct that is offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans?” “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that is unskilled.” “But what, revered sir, is unskilled bodily conduct?” “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that has a blemish.” “But what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that has a blemish?” “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that is injurious.” “And what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that is injurious? <span class='note' hidden=''>bd: There seems to be some corruption in the text here, as these previous and below, are not the type of answer I've seen the Buddha give.</span> “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that is ill in result.” “And what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that is ill in result?” “Whatever bodily conduct, sire, conduces to torment of self and conduces to torment of others and conduces to torment of both, and of which the unskilled states increase much, the skilled states dwindle away, bodily conduct such as this, sire, is offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>But what, revered Ānanda, is the conduct of speech that is offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, that is unskilled.” “But what, revered sir, is unskilled conduct of speech?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, that has a blemish.” “But what, revered sir, is conduct of speech that has a blemish?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, that is injurious.” “And what, revered sir, is conduct of speech that is injurious?’ “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, that is ill in result.” “And what, revered sir, is conduct of speech that is ill in result?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, conduces to torment of self and conduces to torment of others and conduces to torment of both, and of which the unskilled states increase much, the skilled states dwindle away, conduct of speech such as this, sire, is offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>But what, revered Ānanda, is the conduct of thought that is offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, that is unskilled.” “But what, revered sir, is unskilled conduct of thought?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, that has a blemish.” “But what, revered sir, is conduct of thought that has a blemish?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, that is injurious.” “And what, revered sir, is conduct of thought that is injurious?’ “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, that is ill in result.” “And what, revered sir, is conduct of thought that is ill in result?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, conduces to torment of self and conduces to torment of others and conduces to torment of both, and of which the unskilled states increase much, the skilled states dwindle away, conduct of thought such as this, sire, is offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>“Revered Ānanda, does not the Lord praise the getting rid of precisely all unskilled states?” “The Tathāgata, sire, has got rid of all unskilled states and is endowed with skilled states.” “But which, revered Ānanda, is the bodily conduct that is not offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans?” “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that is skilled.” “But what, revered sir, is skilled bodily conduct?” “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that has no blemish.” “But what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that has no blemish?” “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that is non-injurious.” “And what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that is non-injurious?” “Whatever the bodily conduct, sire, that is joyous in result.” “And what, revered sir, is the bodily conduct that is joyous in result?” “Whatever bodily conduct, sire, does not conduce to the torment of self and does not conduce to the torment of others and does not conduce to the torment of both, and of which the unskilled states dwindle away, the skilled states increase much, bodily conduct such as this, sire, is not offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>“But which, revered Ānanda, is the conduct of speech that is not offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, that is skilled.” “But what, revered sir, is skilled conduct of speech?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, that has no blemish.” “But what, revered sir, is conduct of speech that has no blemish?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, that is non-injurious.” “And what, revered sir, is conduct of speech that is non-injurious?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, that is joyous in result.” “And what, revered sir, is conduct of speech that is joyous in result?” “Whatever conduct of speech, sire, does not conduce to the torment of self and does not conduce to the torment of others and does not conduce to the torment of both, and of which the unskilled states dwindle away, the skilled states increase much, conduct of speech such as this, sire, is not offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>“But which, revered Ānanda, is the conduct of thought that is not offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, that is skilled.” “But what, revered sir, is skilled conduct of thought?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, that has no blemish.” “But what, revered sir, is conduct of thought that has no blemish?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, that is non-injurious.” “And what, revered sir, is conduct of thought that is non-injurious?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, that is joyous in result.” “And what, revered sir, is conduct of thought that is joyous in result?” “Whatever conduct of thought, sire, does not conduce to the torment of self and does not conduce to the torment of others and does not conduce to the torment of both, and of which the unskilled states dwindle away, the skilled states increase much, conduct of thought such as this, sire, is not offensive to intelligent recluses and brahmans.” “But, revered Ānanda, does the Lord praise the acquiring of precisely all skilled states?” “The Tathāgata, sire, has got rid of all unskilled states and is endowed with skilled states.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>“It is wonderful, revered sir, it is marvellous, revered sir, how well-spoken is this, revered sir, by the venerable Ānanda; and we, revered sir, are delighted and satisfied with the venerable Ānanda's well-spoken words. Being thus delighted and satisfied, revered sir, with the venerable Ānanda's well-spoken words, we would give a <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en300' href='#pts-vp-en300'>PTS vp En 300</a> valuable elephant to the venerable Ānanda if this, revered sir, were allowable to the venerable Ānanda, we would give a valuable horse if this, revered sir, were allowable to the venerable Ānanda, we would give the boon of a village if this, revered sir, were allowable to the venerable Ānanda. But then we know this, revered sir: This is not allowable to the venerable Ānanda.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a>This piece of foreign cloth, revered sir, inserted into the shaft of a sunshade, has been sent to me by King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the son of (the lady) Videhī, in length it is equal to sixteen (hands), in breadth to eight (hands). Revered sir, let the venerable Ānanda accept it out of compassion.” “No, sire, I am complete as to the three robes.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>“Revered sir, after a great storm has rained down on the high mountain slopes, both you and I have seen how at such a time the river Aciravatī rushes along overflowing both its banks, even so, revered sir, the venerable Ānanda can make a set of three robes for himself from this piece of foreign cloth; and the venerable Ānanda can distribute his old set of three robes among his fellow Brahma-farers. So will this gift of faith of ours go on with an overflow, methinks. Revered sir, let the venerable Ānanda accept this piece of foreign doth.” And the venerable Ānanda accepted the piece of foreign cloth. Then King Pasenadi spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “If it please you, we are going now, revered sir, we are very busy, there is much to be done.” “You must do now, sire, that for which you deem it the right time.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd16' href='#dd16'>Dhdas-bh 16</a>Then King Pasenadi, having rejoiced in what the venerable Ānanda had said, giving thanks, rising from his seat and greeting the venerable Ānanda, departed keeping his right side towards him. Then not long after King Pasenadi had departed, the venerable Ānanda approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance the venerable Ānanda told the Lord the whole of the conversation he had had with King Pasenadi, and he handed that piece of foreign cloth to the Lord.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd17' href='#dd17'>Dhdas-bh 17</a>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, it is a gain for King Pasenadi, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en301' href='#pts-vp-en301'>PTS vp En 301</a> it is well gotten by King Pasenadi that he achieved a sight of Ānanda, that he achieved a paying of homage to him.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd18' href='#dd18'>Dhdas-bh 18</a>Thus spoke the Lord; delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
