<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying among the Sakyans in Nigrodha's monastery in Kapilavatthu. Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for almsfood. Having walked in Kapilavatthu for almsfood, returning from (the quest for) alms after the meal, he approached the Great Wood for the day-sojourn. Having plunged into the Great Wood, he sat down for the day-sojourn at the root of a young vilva tree.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>Then the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand, who was always pacing up and down, always roaming about on foot, approached the Great Wood; having plunged into the Great Wood, he approached the young vilva tree and the Lord; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord; having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he stood at one side leaning on his stick. As he was standing at one side leaning on his stick, the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand, spoke thus to the Lord: “What is the teaching of the recluse, of what views is he?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>“According to my teaching, sir, in the world with its devas, Māras and Brahmas, with its creation with recluses and brahmans, with devas and men, there is no contending with anyone in the world; for which reason perceptions do not obsess that brahman as he <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en142' href='#pts-vp-en142'>PTS vp En 142</a> fares along not fettered to sense-pleasures, without questionings, remorse cut off, and who is devoid of craving for becoming and non-becoming. This, sir, is my teaching, this my view.” When this had been said, the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand, shaking his head <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.109' href='#pts-vp-pli1.109'>PTS vp Pali 1.109</a> and wagging his tongue, departed leaning on his stick, his brow furrowed into three wrinkles.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then the Lord, emerging from solitude towards evening, approached Nigrodha's monastery; having approached, he sat down on the appointed seat. As he was sitting down the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Now I, monks, having dressed in the morning, taking my bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for almsfood. Having walked in Kapilavatthu for almsfood, returning from the (quest for) alms after the meal, I approached the Great Wood for the day-sojourn. Having plunged into the Great Wood, I sat down for the day-sojourn at the root of a young vilva tree. Then the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand, who was always pacing up and down, always roaming about on foot, approached the Great Wood; having plunged into the Great Wood, he approached the young vilva tree and me; having approached, he exchanged greetings with me; having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, he stood at one side leaning on his stick. As he was standing at one side leaning on his stick, the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand, spoke thus to me: ‘What is the teaching of the recluse, of what views is he?’ ‘According to my teaching, sir, in the world with its devas, Māras and Brahmas, with its creation with recluses and brahmans, with devas and men, there is no contending with anyone in the world; for which reason perceptions do not obsess that brahman as he fares along not fettered to sense-pleasures, without questionings, remorse cut off, and who is devoid of craving for becoming and non-becoming. This, sir, is my teaching, this my view.’ When this had been said, the Sakyan, Stick-in-hand, shaking his head and wagging his tongue, departed leaning on his stick, his brow furrowed into three wrinkles.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>When he had spoken thus, a certain monk spoke thus to the Lord: “But what is this teaching, Lord, whereby the Lord, in the world with its devas, Māras and Brahmas, with its creation with recluses and brahmans, would not contend with anyone in the world? And how is it, Lord, that perceptions do not obsess the Lord, that brahman, as he is faring along, not fettered to sense-pleasures, without <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en143' href='#pts-vp-en143'>PTS vp En 143</a> questionings, remorse cut off, and who is devoid of craving for becoming and non-becoming?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>“Whatever is the origin, monk, of the number of obsessions and perceptions which assail a man, if there is nothing to rejoice at, to welcome, to catch hold of, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment, this is itself an end of a propensity to repugnance,<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.110' href='#pts-vp-pli1.110'>PTS vp Pali 1.110</a> this is itself an end of a propensity to views, this is itself an end of a propensity to perplexity, this is itself an end of a propensity to pride, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment to becoming, this is itself an end of a propensity to ignorance, this is itself an end of taking the stick, of taking a weapon, of quarrelling, contending, disputing, accusation, slander, lying speech. In these ways, these evil unskilled states are stopped without remainder.” Thus spoke the Lord. Having said this, the Well-farer, rising from his seat, entered a dwelling-place.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>Soon after the Lord had gone away it occurred to these monks: “Your reverences, the Lord, having recited this recital to us in brief, but not having explained the meaning in full, rising from his seat, entered a dwelling-place: ‘Whatever is the origin, monk, of the number of obsessions and perceptions which assail a man, if there is nothing to rejoice at, to welcome, to catch hold of, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment, this is itself an end of a propensity to repugnance, this is itself an end of a propensity to views, this is itself an end of a propensity to perplexity, this is itself an end of a propensity to pride, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment to becoming, this is itself an end of a propensity to ignorance, this is itself an end of taking the stick, of taking a weapon, of quarrelling, contending, disputing, accusation, slander, lying speech. In these ways, these evil unskilled states are stopped without remainder.’ Now, who can explain the meaning in full of this recital recited in brief by the Lord but whose meaning was not explained in full?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>Then it occurred to these monks: “Now the venerable Kaccāna the Great is both praised by the Lord and revered by intelligent fellow Brahma-farers. The venerable Kaccāna the Great is able to explain in full the meaning of this recital recited in brief by the Lord, but whose meaning was not explained in full. Suppose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great and, having approached, were to question him on this meaning?” Then these monks approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great; having approached, they exchanged greetings with the venerable Kaccāna the Great; having exchanged greetings of friendliness and courtesy, they sat down at a respectful distance. As they were sitting down at a respectful distance, these monks spoke thus to the venerable Kaccāna the Great: “Reverend Kaccāna, the Lord having recited this recital to us in brief, but not having explained the meaning in full, rising from his seat, entered a dwelling-place: ‘Whatever is the origin, monk, of the number of obsessions and perceptions which assail a man, if there is nothing to rejoice at, to welcome, to catch hold of, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment, this is itself an end of a propensity to repugnance, this is itself an end of a propensity to views, this is itself an end of a propensity to perplexity, this is itself an end of a propensity to pride, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment to becoming, this is itself an end of a propensity to ignorance, this is itself an end of taking the stick, of taking a weapon, of quarrelling, contending, disputing, accusation, slander, lying speech. In these ways, these evil unskilled states are stopped without remainder.’ Soon after the Lord had gone <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en144' href='#pts-vp-en144'>PTS vp En 144</a> away, it occurred to us: ‘This venerable Kaccāna the Great is both praised by the Lord and revered by intelligent fellow Brahma-farers; <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.111' href='#pts-vp-pli1.111'>PTS vp Pali 1.111</a> the venerable Kaccāna the Great is able to explain in full the meaning of this recital recited in brief by the Lord but whose meaning was not explained in full. Suppose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great and, having approached, were to question him on this meaning.’ May the venerable Kaccāna the Great explain it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>“Your reverences, as a man walking about aiming at the pith, searching for the pith, looking about for the pith of a great, stable and pithy tree, passing by the root, passing by the trunk, might think that the pith is to be looked for in the branches and foliage, even so is this performance of the venerable ones, for (although) you had the Teacher face to face, yet having ignored that Lord, you judge that it is I who should be questioned on this meaning. But, your reverences, the Lord knows what should be known, sees what should be seen, he has become vision, become knowledge, become <i>Dhamma</i>, become Brahma, he is the propounder, the expounder, the bringer to the goal, the giver of the Deathless, <i>Dhamma</i>-lord, Tathāgata. That was the time when you should have questioned the Lord on this meaning so that you might have understood what the Lord explained to you.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>“Undoubtedly, Kaccāna, the Lord knows what should be known, sees what should be seen, he has become vision, become knowledge, become <i>Dhamma</i>, become Brahma, he is the propounder, the expounder, the bringer to the goal, the giver of the Deathless, <i>Dhamma</i>-lord, Tathāgata. But the venerable Kaccāna the Great is both praised by the Lord, and revered by intelligent fellow Brahma-farers, and the venerable Kaccāna the Great is able to explain in full the meaning of that recital recited in brief by the Lord but whose meaning was not explained in full. Let the venerable Kaccāna explain, without finding it troublesome.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>“Well then, your reverences, listen, pay careful attention and I will speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverence,” these monks answered the venerable Kaccāna the Great in assent. The venerable Kaccāna the Great spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en145' href='#pts-vp-en145'>PTS vp En 145</a> “In regard to that recital, your reverences, which the Lord recited in brief, but not having explained the meaning in full, rising from his seat, entered a dwelling-place: ‘Whatever is the origin, monk, of the number of obsessions and perceptions which assail a man, if there is nothing to rejoice at, to welcome, to catch hold of, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment, this is itself an end of a propensity to repugnance, this is itself an end of a propensity to views, this is itself an end of a propensity to perplexity, this is itself an end of a propensity to pride, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment to becoming, this is itself an end of a propensity to ignorance, this is itself an end of taking the stick, of taking a weapon, of quarrelling, contending, disputing, accusation, slander, lying speech.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd79' href='#dd79'>Dhdas-bh 79</a>“In regard to that<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.113' href='#pts-vp-pli1.113'>PTS vp Pali 1.113</a> recital, your reverences, which the Lord recited in brief, but not having explained the meaning in full, rising from his seat, entered a dwelling-place: ‘Whatever is the origin, monk, of the number of obsessions and perceptions which assail a man, if there is nothing to rejoice at, to welcome, to catch hold of, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment, this is itself an end of a propensity to repugnance, this is itself an end of a propensity to views, this is itself an end of a propensity to perplexity, this is itself an end of a propensity to pride, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment to becoming, this is itself an end of a propensity to ignorance, this is itself an end of taking the stick, of taking a weapon, of quarrelling, contending, disputing, accusation, slander, lying speech.’ of that recital recited by the Lord in brief but whose meaning was not explained in full, I understand the meaning in full thus. But if you, venerable ones, so desire, having approached the Lord, you can question him as to this meaning so that as the Lord explains it to you so may you understand it.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd80' href='#dd80'>Dhdas-bh 80</a>Then these monks, delighting and rejoicing in what the venerable Kaccāna the Great had said, rising from their seats, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance. As they were sitting down at a respectful distance, these monks spoke thus to the Lord:<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en147' href='#pts-vp-en147'>PTS vp En 147</a> “Lord, the Lord having recited this recital to us in brief, rising from his seat, entered a dwelling-place: ‘Whatever is the origin, monk, of the number of obsessions and perceptions which assail a man, if there is nothing to rejoice at, to welcome, to catch hold of, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment, this is itself an end of a propensity to repugnance, this is itself an end of a propensity to views, this is itself an end of a propensity to perplexity, this is itself an end of a propensity to pride, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment to becoming, this is itself an end of a propensity to ignorance, this is itself an end of taking the stick, of taking a weapon, of quarrelling, contending, disputing, accusation, slander, lying speech. In these ways, these evil unskilled states are stopped without remainder.’ Now, Lord, soon after the Lord had gone away, it occurred to us: ‘The Lord, having recited this recital to us in brief, but without explaining its meaning in full, rising from his seat, entered a dwelling-place: “Whatever is the origin, monk, of the number of obsessions and perceptions which assail a man, if there is nothing to rejoice at, to welcome, to catch hold of, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment, this is itself an end of a propensity to repugnance, this is itself an end of a propensity to views, this is itself an end of a propensity to perplexity, this is itself an end of a propensity to pride, this is itself an end of a propensity to attachment to becoming, this is itself an end of a propensity to ignorance, this is itself an end of taking the stick, of taking a weapon, of quarrelling, contending, disputing, accusation, slander, lying speech. In these ways, these evil unskilled states are stopped without remainder.” Now, who can explain in full the meaning of this recital recited in brief by the Lord but whose meaning was not explained in full?’ Then, Lord, it occurred to us: ‘Now the venerable Kaccāna the Great is both praised by the Lord and revered by intelligent fellow Brahma-farers. The venerable Kaccāna the Great is able to explain in full the meaning of this recital recited in brief by the Lord, but whose meaning was not explained in full. Suppose we were to approach the venerable Kaccāna the Great; and having approached were to question the venerable Kaccāna the Great on this meaning?’ Then we, Lord, approached the venerable Kaccāna the Great; having approached, we questioned the venerable Kaccāna the Great on this meaning. The meaning of those (words) was explained to us, Lord, by the venerable Kaccāna the Great by these methods, by these sentences, by these words.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd81' href='#dd81'>Dhdas-bh 81</a>“Your reverences, as a man walking about aiming at the pith, searching for the pith, looking about for the pith of a great, stable and pithy tree, passing by the root, passing by the trunk, might think that the pith is to be looked for in the branches and foliage, even so is this performance of the venerable ones, for (although) you had the Teacher face to face, yet having ignored that Lord, you judge that it is I who should be questioned on this meaning. But, your reverences, the Lord knows what should be known, sees what should be seen, he has become vision, become knowledge, become <i>Dhamma</i>, become Brahma, he is the propounder, the expounder, the bringer to the goal, the giver of the Deathless, <i>Dhamma</i>-lord, Tathāgata. That was the time when you should have questioned the Lord on this meaning so that you might have understood what the Lord explained to you.” “Undoubtedly, Kaccāna, the Lord knows what should be known, sees what should be seen, he has become vision, become knowledge, become <i>Dhamma</i>, become Brahma, he is the propounder, the expounder, the bringer to the goal, the giver of the Deathless, <i>Dhamma</i>-lord, Tathāgata. But the venerable Kaccāna the Great is both praised by the Lord, and revered by intelligent fellow Brahma-farers, and the venerable Kaccāna the Great is able to explain in full the meaning of that recital recited in brief by the Lord but whose meaning was not explained in full.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd82' href='#dd82'>Dhdas-bh 82</a>“Well then, your reverences, listen, pay careful attention and I will speak.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your reverence,” these monks answered the venerable Kaccāna the Great in assent. The venerable Kaccāna the Great spoke thus:</p>
