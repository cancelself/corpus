<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd43' href='#dd43'>Dhdas-bh 43</a>“But, good Gotama, on being asked: “But, good Gotama, where does a monk arise whose mind is freed thus?” you say: ‘Arise,’ Vaccha, does not apply.” “But, good Gotama, on being asked: “Well then, good Gotama, does he not arise?” you say: “‘Does not arise,’ Vaccha, does not apply.” “But, good Gotama, on being asked: “Well then, good Gotama, does he both arise and not arise?” you say: “‘Both arises and does not arise,’ Vaccha, does not apply.” “But, good Gotama, on being asked: “Well then, good Gotama, does he neither arise nor not arise?” you say: “‘Neither arises nor does not arise,’ Vaccha, does not apply.” <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli487' href='#pts-vp-pli487'>PTS vp Pali 487</a>I am at a loss on this point, good Gotama, I am bewildered, and that measure of satisfaction I had from former conversation with the good Gotama, even that have I now lost.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd44' href='#dd44'>Dhdas-bh 44</a>“You ought to be at a loss, Vaccha, you ought to be bewildered. For, Vaccha, this Dhamma is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, peaceful, excellent, beyond dialectic, subtle, intelligible to the wise; but it is hard for you who are of another view, another allegiance, another objective, of a different observance, and under a different teacher. Well then, Vaccha, I will now question you in return. Answer as it pleases you.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd45' href='#dd45'>Dhdas-bh 45</a>What do you think about this, Vaccha? If a fire were blazing in front of you would you know: ‘This fire is blazing in front of me’?” “Good Gotama, if a fire were blazing in front of me I would know: ‘This fire is blazing in front of me.’” “But if, Vaccha, someone were to question you thus: ‘This fire that is blazing in front of you, what is the reason that this fire is blazing?’, what would you, Vaccha, reply when questioned thus?” “If, good Gotama, someone were to question me thus: ‘This fire that is blazing in front of you, what is the reason that this fire is <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en166' href='#pts-vp-en166'>PTS vp En 166</a> blazing?’, I, good Gotama, on being questioned thus would reply thus: ‘This fire that is blazing in front of me, this fire is blazing because of a supply of grass and sticks.” “If that fire that was in front of you, Vaccha, were to be quenched, would you know: ‘This fire that was in front of me has been quenched’?” “If, good Gotama, that fire that was in front of me were to be quenched, I would know: ‘This fire that was in front of me has been quenched.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd46' href='#dd46'>Dhdas-bh 46</a>“But if someone were to question you thus, Vaccha: ‘That fire that was in front of you and that has been quenched, to which direction has that fire gone from here, to the east, or west, or north, or south? On being questioned thus, what would you, Vaccha, reply?” “It does not apply, good Gotama. For, good Gotama, that fire blazed because of a supply of grass and sticks, yet from having totally consumed this and from the lack of other fuel, being without fuel it is reckoned to be quenched.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd47' href='#dd47'>Dhdas-bh 47</a><span class='add'>[1]</span> “Even so, Vaccha, that material shape by which one recognising the Tathāgata might recognise him, that material shape has been got rid of by the Tathāgata, cut off at the root, made like a palm-tree stump that can come to no further existence and is not liable to arise again in the future. Freed from denotation by material shape is the Tathāgata, Vaccha, he is deep, immeasurable, unfathomable as is the great ocean. ‘Arises’ does not apply, ‘does not arise’ does not apply, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli488' href='#pts-vp-pli488'>PTS vp Pali 488</a>‘both arises and does not arise’ does not apply, ‘neither arises nor does not arise’ does not apply.</p>

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd52' href='#dd52'>Dhdas-bh 52</a>When this had been said, the wanderer Vacchagotta spoke thus to the Lord: “Good Gotama, it is like a great sāl-tree not far from a village or market town whose branches and foliage might be <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en167' href='#pts-vp-en167'>PTS vp En 167</a> dissolved because of their impermanence, whose bark and young shoots might be dissolved, whose softwood might be dissolved, so that after a time the branches and foliage gone, the bark and young shoots gone, the softwood gone, clear of them it would be established on the pith. It is excellent, good Gotama, excellent, good Gotama. It is as if, good Gotama, one might set upright what had been upset, or might disclose what was covered, or point out the way to one who had gone astray, or might <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli489' href='#pts-vp-pli489'>PTS vp Pali 489</a>bring an oil-lamp into the darkness, so that those with vision might see material shapes, even so is Dhamma made clear in many a figure by the good Gotama. I am going to the revered Gotama for refuge, and to Dhamma and to the Order of monks. May the revered Gotama accept me as a lay-follower, one gone for refuge from today forth for as long as life lasts.”</p>
