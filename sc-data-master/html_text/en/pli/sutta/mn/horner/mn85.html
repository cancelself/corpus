<h1>85. Discourse to Prince Bodhi</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> At one time the Lord was staying among the Bhaggas in Suṅsumāragira in Bhesakaḷā Grove in the deer-park. At that time Prince Bodhi had a palace named Kokanada; it had not long been built and had had not (yet) been inhabited by a recluse or brahman or by any human being. Then Prince Bodhi addressed the brahman youth Sañjikā's son, saying: “Come you, good Sañjikā's son, approach the Lord; having approached, in my name salute the Lord's feet with your head, and ask whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort, and say: ‘Lord, Prince Bodhi salutes the Lord's feet with his head and asks whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort.’ And speak thus to him: ‘Revered sir, may the Lord, together with the Order of monks, consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow with Prince Bodhi.’” “Yes, sir,” and the brahman youth Sañjikā's son, having answered Prince Bodhi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the Lord, and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way, he sat down at a respectful distance.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the brahman youth Sañjikā's son spoke thus to the Lord: “Good Gotama, Prince Bodhi salutes with his head the good Gotama's feet and asks whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort. And he speaks thus: ‘May the revered Gotama, together with the Order of monks, consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow with Prince Bodhi.’” The Lord consented by becoming silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Then the brahman youth Sañjikā's son, having understood the Lord's consent, rising from his seat approached Prince Bodhi; having approached, he spoke thus to Prince Bodhi: “I spoke in your name, good sir, to the Lord Gotama, saying: “Good Gotama, Prince Bodhi salutes with his head the good Gotama's feet and asks whether he is well, not indisposed, of bodily vigour, strong, abiding in comfort. And he speaks thus: ‘May the revered Gotama, together with the Order of monks, consent to (accept) a meal on the morrow with <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en280' href='#pts-vp-en280'>PTS vp En 280</a> Prince Bodhi.’” And the recluse Gotama consented.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then, after Prince Bodhi had had sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared in his own dwelling towards the end of that night, and had the Kokanada palace spread with white cloths as far as the last flight of stairs, he addressed the brahman youth Sañjikā's son, saying: “Come you, good Sañjikā's son, approach the Lord; having approached, announce the time to the Lord, saying: ‘It is time, revered sir, the meal is ready.’” “Yes, good sir,” and the brahman youth Sañjikā's son, having answered Prince Bodhi in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, he announced the time to the Lord, saying: “It is time, revered sir, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a></p>
<h2><span class='add'>The Buddha refuses to follow some customs</span></h2>
<p>Then the Lord, dressing in the morning and taking his bowl and robe, approached Prince Bodhi's dwelling. At that time Prince Bodhi, while he was waiting for the Lord, was standing at the porch of the outside gateway. And Prince Bodhi saw the Lord coming in the distance; having seen him and gone to meet him, he greeted and honoured the Lord and approached the Kokanada palace.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>Then the Lord stood leaning against the last flight of stairs. And Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord: “Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths, let the Well-farer step on the cloths so that for a long time it may be for my welfare and happiness.” When this had been said, the Lord was silent. And a second time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord: “Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths, let the Well-farer step on the cloths so that for a long time it may be for my welfare and happiness.” When this had been said, the Lord was silent. And a third time Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord: “Revered sir, let the Lord step on the cloths, let the Well-farer step on the cloths so that for a long time it may be for my welfare and happiness.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>Then the Lord looked towards the venerable Ānanda. And the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to Prince Bodhi: “Prince, have the cloths packed away. The Lord will not tread upon a cloth carpeting; the Tathāgata looks towards the folk that come after.” Then Prince Bodhi had the cloths packed away, and had a seat made ready upstairs in the Kokanada palace. Then the Lord having ascended the Kokanada palace, sat down on the seat made ready together with the Order of monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a></p>
<h2><span class='add'>Happiness through Suffering?</span></h2>
<p>Then Prince Bodhi with his own hand served and satisfied the Order of monks with the Lord at its head with sumptuous foods, solid and soft. Then when the Lord had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from his bowl, Prince Bodhi, having taken a lower seat, sat down at a respectful distance. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en281' href='#pts-vp-en281'>PTS vp En 281</a> As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Prince Bodhi Spoke thus to the Lord: “Lord, it has occurred to me thus: Happiness is not to be achieved through happiness; happiness is to be achieved through suffering.” “To me too, Prince, before my Awakening, while I was still the bodhisatta, not fully awakened, it occurred: Happiness is not to be achieved through happiness; happiness is to be achieved through suffering.” Then I, Prince, after a time, being young, my hair coal-black, possessed of radiant youth, in the prime of my life, although my unwilling parents wept and wailed, having cut off my hair and beard, having put on yellow robes, went forth from home into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a></p>
<h3><span class='add'>Testing the Third Formless State</span></h3>
<p>I, being gone forth thus, a quester for whatever is good, searching for the incomparable, matchless path to peace, approached Āḷāra the Kālāma; having approached, I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma: ‘I, reverend Kālāma, want to fare the Brahmā-faring in this dhamma and discipline.’ This said, Prince, Āḷāra the Kālāma spoke thus to me: ‘Let the venerable one proceed; this dhamma is such that an intelligent man, having soon realised super-knowledge for himself (as learnt from) his own teacher, may enter on and abide in it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>So I, Prince, very soon, very quickly, mastered that dhamma. I, Prince, as far as mere lip service, mere repetition were concerned, spoke the doctrine of knowledge, and the doctrine of the elders, and I claimed, I as well as others, that ‘I know, I see.’ Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘But Āḷāra the Kālāma does not merely proclaim this dhamma simply out of faith: Having realised super-knowledge for myself, entering on it, I am abiding therein. For surely Āḷāra the Kālāma proceeds knowing, seeing this dhamma.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>Then did I, Prince, approach Āḷāra the Kālāma; having approached, I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma: ‘To what extent do you, reverend Kālāma, having realised super-knowledge for yourself, entering thereon, proclaim this dhamma?’ When this had been said, Prince, Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaimed the plane of no-thing.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has faith, I too have faith. It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has energy, I too have energy. It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has mindfulness, I too have mindfulness. It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has concentration, I too have concentration. It is not only Āḷāra the Kālāma who has intuitive wisdom, I too have intuitive wisdom. Suppose now that I should strive for the realisation of that dhamma which Āḷāra the Kālāma proclaims: ‘Having realised super-knowledge for myself, entering on it I am abiding therein?’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>So I, Prince, very soon, very quickly, having realised super-knowledge for myself, entering on that dhamma, abided therein. Then I, Prince, approached Āḷāra the Kālāma; having approached, I spoke thus to Āḷāra the Kālāma: ‘Is it to this extent that you, reverend Kalama, proclaim this dhamma, entering on it, having realised it by your own super-knowledge?’ ‘It is to this extent that I, your reverence, proclaim this dhamma, entering on it, having realised it by my own super-knowledge.’ ‘I too, your reverence, having realised this dhamma by my own super-knowledge, entering on it am abiding in it.’ ‘It is profitable for us, it is well gotten for us, your reverence, that we see a fellow Brahmā-farer such as the venerable one. This dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim, having realised it by my own super-knowledge, is the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in, having realised it by your own super-knowledge; the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in, having realised it by your own super-knowledge, is the dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim, having realised it by my own super-knowledge. The dhamma that I know, this is the dhamma that you know. The dhamma that you know, this is the dhamma that I know. As I am, so are you; as you are, so am I. Come now, your reverence, being just the two of us, let us look after this group.’ In this way, Prince, did Āḷāra the Kālāma, being my teacher, set me, the pupil, on the same level as himself and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a>Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘This dhamma does not conduce to disregard nor to dispassion nor to stopping nor to tranquillity nor to super-knowledge nor to awakening nor to nibbāna, but only as far as reaching the plane of no-thing.’ So I, Prince, not getting enough from this dhamma, disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a></p>
<h3><span class='add'>Testing the Forth Formless State</span></h3>
<p>Then I, Prince, a quester for whatever is good, searching for the incomparable, matchless path to peace, approached Uddaka, Rāma's son; having approached, I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son: ‘I, your reverence, want to fare the Brahmā-faring in this dhamma and discipline.’ This said, Prince, Uddaka, Rāma's son, spoke thus to me: ‘Let the venerable one proceed; this dhamma is such that an intelligent man, having soon realised super-knowledge for himself, (as learnt from) his own teacher, may enter on and abide in it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd16' href='#dd16'>Dhdas-bh 16</a>So I, Prince, very soon, very quickly, mastered that dhamma. I, Prince, as far as mere lip service, mere repetition were concerned, spoke the doctrine of knowledge and the doctrine of the elders, and I claimed, I as well as others, that ‘I know, I see.’ Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘But Uddaka, Rāma's son, does not merely proclaim this dhamma simply out of faith: Having realised super-knowledge for myself, entering on it, I am abiding in it. For surely Uddaka, Rāma's son, proceeds knowing and seeing this dhamma.’ Then did I, Prince, approach Uddaka, Rāma's son; having approached, I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son: ‘To what extent do you, reverend Rāma, having realised super-knowledge for yourself, entering thereon proclaim this dhamma?’ When this had been said, Prince, Uddaka, Rāma's son, proclaimed the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd17' href='#dd17'>Dhdas-bh 17</a>Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘It is not only Rāma who has faith, I too have faith. It is not only Rāma who has energy, I too have energy. It is not only Rāma who has mindfulness, I too have mindfulness. It is not only Rāma who has concentration, I too have concentration. It is not only Rāma who has intuitive wisdom, I too have intuitive wisdom. Suppose now that I should strive for the realisation of that dhamma which Rāma proclaims: ‘Having realised super-knowledge for myself, entering on it I am abiding in it?’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd18' href='#dd18'>Dhdas-bh 18</a>So I, Prince, very soon, very quickly, having realised super-knowledge for myself, entering on that dhamma, abided therein. Then I, Prince, approached Uddaka, Rāma's son; having approached, I spoke thus to Uddaka, Rāma's son: ‘Is it to this extent that you, reverend Rāma, proclaim this dhamma, entering on it, having realised it by your own super-knowledge?’ ‘It is to this extent that I, your reverence, proclaim this dhamma, entering on it, having realised it by my own super-knowledge.’ ‘I too, your reverence, having realised this dhamma by my own super-knowledge, entering on it am abiding in it.’ ‘It is profitable for us, it is well gotten by us, your reverence, that we see a fellow-Brahmā-farer such as the venerable one. This dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim, having realised it by my own super-knowledge, is the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in, having realised it by your own super-knowledge; the dhamma that you, entering on, are abiding in, having realised it by your own super-knowledge, is the dhamma that I, entering on, proclaim, having realised it by my own super-knowledge. The dhamma that I know, this is the dhamma that you know. That dhamma that you know, this is the dhamma that I know. As I am, so are you; as you are, so am I. Come now, your reverence, being just the two of us, let us look after this group. In this way, Prince, did Uddaka, Rāma's son, being my teacher, set me, the pupil, on the same level as himself and honoured me with the highest honour.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd19' href='#dd19'>Dhdas-bh 19</a>Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘This dhamma does not conduce to disregard nor to dispassion nor to stopping nor to tranquillity nor to super-knowledge nor to awakening nor to nibbāna, but only as far as reaching the plane of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.’ So I, Prince, not getting enough from this dhamma, disregarded and turned away from this dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd20' href='#dd20'>Dhdas-bh 20</a></p>
<h2><span class='add'>Finding a Suitable Place for Striving</span></h2>
<p>Then I, Prince, a quester for whatever is good, searching for the incomparable, matchless path to peace, walking on tour through Magadha in due course arrived at Uruvelā, the camp township. There I saw a delightful stretch of land and a lovely woodland grove, and a clear flowing river with a delightful ford, and a village for support nearby. It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Indeed it is a delightful stretch of land, and the woodland grove is lovely, and the river flows clear with a delightful ford, and there is a village for support nearby. Indeed this does well for the striving of a young man set on striving.’ <span class='note' hidden=''>BD: There seems to be no determination here to sit and not move till full liberation. Later tradition seems to have swapped around a few items: 1. finding a suitable place, 2. determining it will do and 3. (possibly) sitting down after a long walk; and come up with 1. finding a suitable place, 3. sitting down and 2. determining not to move from that place - the sitting posture, rather than the suitable place.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd21' href='#dd21'>Dhdas-bh 21</a></p>
<h2><span class='add'>Three Similes</span></h2>
<p>Moreover, Prince, three similes occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before: It is as if there were a wet sappy stick placed in water; then a man might come along bringing an upper piece of fire-stick, and thinking: ‘I will light a fire, I will get heat.’ What do you think about this, Prince? Could that man, bringing an upper piece of fire-stick, and rubbing that wet sappy stick that had been placed in water (with it), light a fire, could he get heat?” “No, good Gotama. What is the cause of this? It is, good Gotama, that such a stick is wet and sappy and that it was placed in water. That man would only get fatigue and distress.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd22' href='#dd22'>Dhdas-bh 22</a>“In like manner, Prince, whatever recluses or brahmans dwell not aloof from pleasures of the senses that are bodily, then if that which is for them, among the sense-pleasures, desire for sense-pleasure, affection for sense-pleasure, infatuation with sense-pleasure, thirst for sense-pleasure, fever for sense-pleasure, if that is not properly got rid of subjectively nor properly allayed, whether these worthy recluses and brahmans experience feelings which are acute, painful, sharp, severe, they could not become those for knowledge, for vision, for the incomparable Self-awakening; and whether these worthy recluses and brahmans do not experience feelings which are acute, painful, sharp, severe, they could not become those for knowledge, for vision, for the incomparable Self-awakening. This, Prince, was the first parable that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd23' href='#dd23'>Dhdas-bh 23</a>Then, Prince, a second parable occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before. It is as if, Prince, a wet, sappy stick were placed on dry ground, far from water. Then a man might come along bringing an upper piece of fire-stick, and thinking: ‘I will light a fire, I will get heat.’ What do you think about this, Prince? Could that man, bringing an upper piece of fire-stick, and rubbing that wet sappy stick that had been placed on the dry ground, far from water, light a fire, could he get heat?” “No, good Gotama. What is the cause of this? It is, good Gotama, that that stick is wet and sappy although it had been placed on dry ground, far from water. So that man would only get fatigue and distress.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd24' href='#dd24'>Dhdas-bh 24</a>“In like manner, Prince, whatever recluses or brahmans dwell not aloof from pleasures of the senses that are bodily, then if that which is for them, among the sense-pleasures, desire for sense-pleasure, affection for sense-pleasure, infatuation with sense-pleasure, thirst for sense-pleasure, fever for sense-pleasure, if that is not properly got rid of subjectively nor properly allayed, whether these worthy recluses and brahmans experience feelings which are acute, painful, sharp, severe, they could not become those for knowledge, for vision, for the incomparable Self-awakening; and whether these worthy recluses and brahmans do not experience feelings which are acute, painful, sharp, severe, they could not become those for knowledge, for vision, for the incomparable Self-awakening. This, Prince, was the second parable that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd25' href='#dd25'>Dhdas-bh 25</a>Then, Prince, a third parable occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before. It is as if, Prince, a dry sapless stick were placed on the dry ground, far from water. Then a man might come along bringing an upper piece of fire-stick, and thinking: ‘I will light a fire, I will get heat.’ What do you think about this, Prince? Could that man, bringing an upper piece of fire-stick, and rubbing that dry sapless stick that had been placed on dry ground, far from water, light a fire, could he get heat?” “Yes, good Gotama. What is the cause of this? It is, good Gotama, that that stick was dry and sapless and had been placed on dry ground far from water.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd26' href='#dd26'>Dhdas-bh 26</a>“In like manner, Prince, whatever recluses or brahmans dwell aloof from pleasures of the senses that are bodily, then if that which is for them, among the sense-pleasures, desire for sense-pleasure, affection for sense-pleasure, infatuation with sense-pleasure, thirst for sense-pleasure, fever for sense-pleasure, if this is well got rid of subjectively, well allayed, then whether these worthy recluses and brahmans experience feelings that are acute, painful, sharp, severe, indeed they become those for knowledge, for vision, for the incomparable Self-awakening; and whether these worthy recluses and brahmans do not experience feelings that are acute, painful, sharp, severe, indeed they become those for knowledge, for vision, for the incomparable Self-awakening. This, Prince, was the third parable that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd27' href='#dd27'>Dhdas-bh 27</a>These, Prince, were the three parables that occurred to me spontaneously, never heard before.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd28' href='#dd28'>Dhdas-bh 28</a></p>
<h2><span class='add'>Over Exertion</span></h2>
<p>It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Suppose now that I, with my teeth clenched, with my tongue pressed against the palate, by mind should subdue, restrain and dominate my mind?’ So I, Prince, with my teeth clenched, with my tongue pressed against the palate, by mind subdued, restrained and dominated my mind. While I was subduing, restraining and dominating my mind, with the teeth clenched, the tongue pressed against the palate, sweat poured from my armpits. It is as if, Prince, a strong man, having taken hold of a weaker man by his head or shoulders, would subdue, restrain and dominate him. Even so, while I, Prince, was subduing, restraining and dominating my mind by mind, with my teeth clenched, with my tongue pressed against the palate, sweat poured from my armpits. Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me, unmuddled mindfulness set up, yet my body was turbulent, not calmed, because I was harassed in striving by striving against that very pain. But yet, Prince, that painful feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd29' href='#dd29'>Dhdas-bh 29</a>It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Suppose now that I should meditate the non-breathing meditation? So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose. When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose, there came to be an exceedingly loud noise of winds escaping by the auditory passages. As there comes to be an exceedingly loud noise from the roaring of a smith's bellows, even so when I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose, there came to be an exceedingly loud noise of wind escaping by the auditory passages. Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me, unmuddled mindfulness set up, yet my body was turbulent, not calmed, because I was harassed in striving by striving against that very pain. It was even in this wise, Prince, that a painful feeling that had arisen in me persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd30' href='#dd30'>Dhdas-bh 30</a>It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Suppose now that I should still meditate the non-breathing meditation?’ So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears. When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears, exceedingly loud winds rent my head. As, Prince, a strong man might cleave one's head with a sharp-edged sword, even so when I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears, exceedingly loud winds rent my head. Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me, unmuddled mindfulness set up, yet my body was turbulent, not calmed, because I was harassed in striving by striving against that very pain. But yet, Prince, that painful feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd31' href='#dd31'>Dhdas-bh 31</a>It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Suppose that I should still meditate the non-breathing meditation?’ So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears. When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears, I came to have very bad headaches. As, Prince, a strong man might clamp a turban on one's head with a tight leather strap, even so when I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears, did I come to have very bad headaches. Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me, unmuddled mindfulness set up, yet my body was turbulent, not calmed, because I was harassed in striving by striving against that very pain. But yet, Prince, that painful feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd32' href='#dd32'>Dhdas-bh 32</a>It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Suppose now that I should still meditate the non-breathing meditation?’ So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears. When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears, very strong winds cut through my stomach. As, Prince, a skilled cattle-butcher or his apprentice might cut through the stomach with a sharp butcher's knife, even so, Prince, did very strong winds cut through my stomach. Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me, unmuddled mindfulness set up, yet my body was turbulent, not calmed, because I was harassed in striving by striving against that very pain. But yet, Prince, that painful feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd33' href='#dd33'>Dhdas-bh 33</a>It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Suppose now that I should still meditate the non-breathing meditation?’ So I, Prince, stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears. When I, Prince, had stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears, there came to be a fierce heat in my body. As, Prince, two strong men, having taken hold of a weaker man by his limbs, might set fire to him, might make him sizzle up over a charcoal pit, even so, Prince, when I had stopped breathing in and breathing out through the mouth and through the nose and through the ears, did there come to be a fierce heat in my body. Although, Prince, unsluggish energy came to be stirred up in me, unmuddled mindfulness set up, yet my body was turbulent, not calmed, because I was harassed in striving by striving against that very pain. But yet, Prince, that painful feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind. In addition to this, Prince, <i>devatās</i>, having seen me, spoke thus: ‘The recluse Gotama has passed away.’ Other <i>devatās</i> spoke thus; ‘The recluse Gotama has not passed away, but he is passing away.’ Other <i>devatās</i> spoke thus: ‘The recluse Gotama has not passed away, nor is he passing away; the recluse Gotama is a perfected one, the mode of living of a perfected one is just like this.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd34' href='#dd34'>Dhdas-bh 34</a>It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Suppose now that I should take the line of desisting from all food?’ Then, Prince, <i>devatās,</i> having approached me, spoke thus: ‘Do not, good sir, take the line of desisting from all food. If you, good sir, take the line of desisting from all food, then we will give you deva-like essences to take in through the pores of the skin; you will keep going by means of them.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd35' href='#dd35'>Dhdas-bh 35</a>Then, Prince, it occurred to me: ‘Suppose that I should take the line of not eating anything, and these <i>devatās</i> were to give me deva-like essences to take in through the pores of the skin, and that I should keep going by means of them, that would be an imposture in me.’ So I, Prince, rejected those <i>devatās</i> I said, ‘Enough.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd36' href='#dd36'>Dhdas-bh 36</a>It occurred to me, Prince: ‘Suppose now that I were to take food little by little, drop by drop, such as bean-soup or vetch-soup or chick-pea-soup or pea-soup? So I, Prince, took food little by little, drop by drop, such as bean-soup or vetch-soup or chick-pea-soup or pea-soup. While I, Prince, was taking food little by little, drop by drop, such as bean-soup or vetch-soup or chick-pea-soup or pea-soup, my body became exceedingly emaciated. Because I ate so little, all my limbs became like the joints of withered creepers; because I ate so little, my buttocks became like a bullock's hoof; because I ate so little, my protruding backbone became like a string of balls; because I ate so little, my gaunt ribs became like the crazy rafters of a tumble-down shed; because I ate so little, the pupils of my eyes appeared lying low and deep; because I ate so little, my scalp became shrivelled and shrunk as a bitter white gourd cut before it is ripe becomes shrivelled and shrunk by a hot wind. If I, Prince, thought: ‘I will touch the skin of my belly,’ it was my backbone that I took hold of. If I thought: ‘I will touch my backbone,’ it was the skin of my belly that I took hold of. For because I ate so little, the skin of my belly, Prince, came to be cleaving to my backbone. If I, Prince, thought: ‘I will obey the calls of nature,’ I fell down on my face then and there, because I ate so little. If I, Prince, soothing my body, stroked my limbs with my hand, the hairs, rotted at the roots, fell away from my body as I stroked my limbs with my hand, because I ate so little. And further, Prince, men, having seen me, spoke thus: ‘The recluse Gotama is black.’ Other men spoke thus: ‘The recluse Gotama is not black, the recluse Gotama is deep brown.’ Some men spoke thus: ‘The recluse Gotama is not black, he is not even deep brown, the recluse Gotama is of a sallow colour.’ To such an extent, Prince, was my clear pure complexion spoilt because I ate so little.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd37' href='#dd37'>Dhdas-bh 37</a>This, Prince, occurred to me: ‘Some recluses and brahmans in the past have experienced feelings that were acute, painful, sharp, severe; but this is paramount, nor is there worse than this. And some recluses and brahmans in the future will experience feelings that are acute, painful, sharp, severe; but this is paramount, nor is there worse than this. And some recluses and brahmans are now experiencing feelings that are acute, painful, sharp, severe; but this is paramount, nor is there worse than this. But I, by this severe austerity, do not reach states of further-men, the excellent knowledge and vision befitting the ariyans. Could there be another way to awakening?</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd38' href='#dd38'>Dhdas-bh 38</a></p>
<h2><span class='add'>Recognising the Middle Way - Wholesome Happiness</span></h2>
<p>This, Prince, occurred to me: ‘I know that while my father, the Sakyan, was ploughing, and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, aloof from pleasures of the senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, entering on the first meditation, which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness, and is rapturous and joyful, and while abiding therein, I thought: ‘Now could this be a way to awakening?’ Then, following on my mindfulness, Prince, there was the consciousness: ‘This is itself the Way to awakening.’ <span class='note' hidden=''>BD: Here the Buddha states Jhana is the Way to Awakening - the Middle Way, not just a part of the way - the eighth step/item of the Noble Eightfold Path.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd39' href='#dd39'>Dhdas-bh 39</a>This occurred to me, Prince: ‘Now, am I afraid of that happiness which is happiness apart from sense-pleasures, apart from unskilled states of mind?’ This occurred to me, Prince: ‘I am not afraid of that happiness which is happiness apart from sense-pleasures, apart from unskilled states of mind.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd40' href='#dd40'>Dhdas-bh 40</a>This occurred to me, Prince: ‘Now it is not easy to reach that happiness by thus subjecting the body to extreme emaciation. Suppose I were to take material nourishment, boiled rice and sour milk?’ So I, Prince, took material nourishment, boiled rice and sour milk. Now at that time, Prince, five monks were attending me and (they thought): ‘When the recluse Gotama wins <i>Dhamma</i> he will announce it to us.’ But when I, Prince, took material nourishment, boiled rice and sour milk, then these five monks turned on me in disgust, saying: ‘The recluse Gotama lives in abundance, he is wavering in his striving, he has reverted to a life of abundance.’ But when I, Prince, had taken some material nourishment, having picked up strength, <span class='add'>[1]</span> aloof from pleasures of the senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, I entered on and abided in the first meditation which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness, and is rapturous and joyful. But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind. <span class='add'>[2]</span> By allaying initial thought and discursive thought, with the mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point, I entered on and abided in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought, is born of concentration, and is rapturous and joyful. But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind. <span class='add'>[3]</span> By the fading out of rapture I dwelt with equanimity, attentive and clearly conscious, and I experienced in my person that joy of which the ariyans say: ‘Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,’ and I entered on and abided in the third meditation. But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind. <span class='add'>[4]</span> By getting rid of joy and by getting rid of anguish, by the going down of former pleasures and sorrows, I entered into and abided in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness. But yet, Prince, the pleasurable feeling, arising in me, persisted without impinging on my mind.</p>

<h2><span class='add'>The Super-Knowledges</span></h2>
<h3><span class='add'>The Knowledge about His Past</span></h3>
<p>With the mind composed thus, quite purified, quite clarified, without blemish, without defilement, grown soft and workable, fixed, immovable, I directed my mind to the knowledge and recollection of former habitations: I remembered a variety of former habitations, thus: one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, and many an eon of integration and many an eon of disintegration and many an eon of integration-disintegration; such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I came to be in another state where such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I arose here. Thus I remember divers former habitations in all their modes and detail. This, Prince, was the first knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night; ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, even as I abided diligent, ardent, self-resolute.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd42' href='#dd42'>Dhdas-bh 42</a></p>
<h3><span class='add'>The Knowledge about (His) Present</span></h3>
<p>Then with the mind composed, quite purified, quite clarified, without blemish, without defilement, grown soft and workable, fixed, immovable, I directed my mind to the knowledge of the passing hence and the arising of beings. With the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men I see beings as they pass hence or come to be; I comprehend that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going, according to the consequences of their deeds, and I think: Indeed these worthy beings who were possessed of wrong conduct in body, who were possessed of wrong conduct of speech, who were possessed of wrong conduct of thought, scoffers at the ariyans, holding a wrong view, incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body, who were possessed of good conduct in speech, who were possessed of good conduct in thought, who did not scoff at the ariyans, holding a right view, incurring deeds consequent on a right view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world. Thus with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men do I see beings as they pass hence, as they arise; I comprehend that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going according to the consequences of their deeds. This, Prince, was the second knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the night; ignorance was dispelled, knowledge arose, darkness was dispelled, light arose, even as I abided diligent, ardent, self-resolute.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd43' href='#dd43'>Dhdas-bh 43</a></p>
<h3><span class='add'>Dhamma is very subtle</span></h3>
<p>Then Prince, it occurred to me: ‘This Dhamma, won to by me is deep, difficult to see, difficult to understand, tranquil, excellent, beyond dialectic, subtle, intelligible to the learned. But this is a creation delighting in sensual pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure. So that for a creation delighting in sensual pleasure, delighted by sensual pleasure, rejoicing in sensual pleasure, this were a matter difficult to see, that is to say causal uprising by way of condition. This too were a matter difficult to see, that is to say the tranquillising of all the activities, the renunciation of all attachment, the destruction of craving, dispassion, stopping, nibbāna. But if I were to teach Dhamma and others were not to understand me, that would be a weariness to me, that would be a vexation to me.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd44' href='#dd44'>Dhdas-bh 44</a>Moreover, Prince, these verses not heard before in the past spontaneously occurred to me:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd45' href='#dd45'>Dhdas-bh 45</a>This that through many toils I've won,<br>
Enough! why should I make it known?<br>

This Dhamma is not understood.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd46' href='#dd46'>Dhdas-bh 46</a>Leading on against the stream,<br>
Deep, subtle, difficult to see, delicate,<br>
Unseen ‘twill be by passion's slaves,<br>

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd47' href='#dd47'>Dhdas-bh 47</a>In such wise, as I was pondering,<br>
Prince, my mind inclined to little effort<br>
and not teaching Dhamma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd48' href='#dd48'>Dhdas-bh 48</a>Then, Prince, it occurred to Brahmā Sahampati who knew with his mind the reasoning in my mind: ‘Alas, the world is lost, alas, the world is destroyed, inasmuch as the mind of the Tathāgata, the perfected one, the fully awakened one, inclines to little effort and not to teaching Dhamma.’ Then, Prince, as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or might bend back his outstretched arm, even so did Brahmā Sahampati, vanishing from the Brahmā-world, become manifest before me. Then, Prince, Brahmā Sahampati, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having saluted me with joined palms, spoke thus to me: ‘Lord, let the Lord teach Dhamma, let the well-farer teach Dhamma; there are beings with little dust in their eyes who; not hearing Dhamma, are decaying, (but if) they are learners of Dhamma they will grow.’ Thus spoke Brahmā Sahampati to me, Prince; having said this, he further spoke thus:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd49' href='#dd49'>Dhdas-bh 49</a>‘There has appeared in Magadha before thee,<br>
An unclean dhamma by (minds) with stains devised.<br>
Open this door of deathlessness;<br>
let them hear Dhamma awakened to by the stainless one.</p>

E'en so do thou, O Wisdom fair, ascending,<br>

Look down, from grief released, upon the peoples,<br>
Sunken in grief, oppressed with birth and age.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd51' href='#dd51'>Dhdas-bh 51</a>Arise, thou hero! Conqueror in the battle!<br>
Thou leader of the caravan, without a debt!<br>
Walk in the world. Let the Blessed One Teach Dhamma;<br>
they who learn will grow.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd52' href='#dd52'>Dhdas-bh 52</a>And then I, Prince, having understood Brahmā's entreaty, out of compassion surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One. As I, Prince, was surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One, I saw beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with acute faculties with dull faculties, of good dispositions, of bad dispositions, docile, indocile, few seeing from fear sins and the world beyond. Even as in a pond of blue lotuses or in a pond of red lotuses or in a pond of white lotuses, a few red lotuses, a few blue lotuses, a few white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water, do not rise above the water but thrive while altogether immersed; a few blue lotuses, a few red lotuses, a few white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water and reach the surface of the water a few blue lotuses, a few red lotuses, a few white lotuses are born in the water, grow in the water and stand rising out of the water, undefiled by the water; even so did I, Prince, surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One, see beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with acute faculties, with dull faculties, of good dispositions, of bad dispositions, docile, indocile, few seeing from fear sins and the world beyond.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd53' href='#dd53'>Dhdas-bh 53</a>Then I, Prince, addressed Brahmā Sahampati in verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd54' href='#dd54'>Dhdas-bh 54</a>Opened for those who hear<br>

Thinking of useless fatigue, Brahmā,<br>
I have not preached Dhamma Sublime<br>
and excellent for men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd55' href='#dd55'>Dhdas-bh 55</a>Then, Prince, Brahmā Sahampati, thinking: ‘The opportunity was made by me for the Lord to teach Dhamma,’ having greeted me, keeping his right side towards me, vanished then and there.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd56' href='#dd56'>Dhdas-bh 56</a></p>
<h3><span class='add'>Who to Teach?</span></h3>
<p>Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘Now, to whom should I first teach this Dhamma? Who will understand this Dhamma quickly?’ Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘Indeed this Āḷāra the Kālāma is learned, experienced, wise, and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes. Suppose that I were to teach Dhamma first to Āḷāra the Kālāma he will understand this Dhamma quickly. Then devatās having approached me, spoke thus: Lord, Āḷāra the Kālāma passed away seven days ago.’ So knowledge and vision arose in me that Āḷāra the Kālāma had passed away seven days ago. Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘Āḷāra the Kālāma has suffered a great loss. For if he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood it quickly.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd57' href='#dd57'>Dhdas-bh 57</a>Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘Now, to whom could I first teach this Dhamma? Who will understand this Dhamma quickly? Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘This Uddaka, Rāma's son, is learned, experienced, wise, and for a long time has had little dust in his eyes. Suppose that I were to teach Dhamma first to Uddaka, Rāma's son? He will understand this Dhamma quickly,’ Then, Prince, <i>devatās,</i> having approached me, spoke thus: ‘Lord, Uddaka, Rāma's son, passed away last night.’ So knowledge and vision arose in me that Uddaka, Rāma's son, had passed away last night. Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘Uddaka, Rāma's son, has suffered a great loss. For if he had heard this Dhamma, he would have understood it quickly.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd58' href='#dd58'>Dhdas-bh 58</a>Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘Now to whom could I first teach this Dhamma? Who will understand this Dhamma quickly? Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘This group of five monks who waited on me when I was self-resolute in striving, were very helpful. Suppose that I were to teach Dhamma first to this group of five monks? Then it occurred to me, Prince: ‘But where is the group of five monks staying at present? Then, monks I saw with deva-vision, purified and surpassing that of men, the group of five monks staying near Benares at Isipatana in the deer-park.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd59' href='#dd59'>Dhdas-bh 59</a>Then I, Prince, having stayed at Uruvelā for as long as I found suiting, set out on tour for Benares. Then, monks, Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, saw me as I was going along the high road between Gayā and the (Tree of) Awakening; having seen me, he spoke thus: ‘Your reverence, your faculties are quite pure, your complexion is very bright, very clear. On account of whom have you, your reverence, gone forth, or who is your teacher, or whose dhamma do you profess?’ When this had been said, I, monks, addressed Upaka, the Naked Ascetic, in verses:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd60' href='#dd60'>Dhdas-bh 60</a>‘Victorious over all,<br>

</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd64' href='#dd64'>Dhdas-bh 64</a>‘According to what you claim, your reverence, you ought to be victor of the unending.’</p>

</blockquote>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd66' href='#dd66'>Dhdas-bh 66</a>When this had been said, Prince, Upaka the Naked Ascetic, having said: ‘May it be (so), your reverence” having shaken his head, went off having taken a different road.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd67' href='#dd67'>Dhdas-bh 67</a>Then I, Prince, walking on tour, in due course arrived at Benares, Isipatana, the deer-park and the group of five monks. Prince, the group of five monks saw me coming in the distance, and seeing me they agreed among themselves, saying: ‘Your reverences, this recluse Gotama is coming, he lives in abundance, he is wavering in his striving, he has reverted to a life of abundance. He should be neither greeted, nor stood up for, nor should his bowl and robe be received; all the same a seat may be put out, he can sit down if he wants to.’ But as I, Prince, gradually approached this group of five monks, so this group of five monks were not able to adhere to their own agreement; having approached me some received my bowl and robe, some made a seat ready, some brought water for washing the feet, and they addressed me by my name and with the epithet ‘your reverence.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd68' href='#dd68'>Dhdas-bh 68</a>When this had been said, I, Prince, spoke thus to the group of five monks: ‘Do not, monks, address a Tathāgata by his name or by the epithet ‘your reverence.’ Monks, the Tathāgata is one perfected, a fully Self-awakened One. Give ear, monks, the deathless is found, I instruct, I teach Dhamma. Going along in accordance with what is enjoined, having soon realised here and now by your own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, you will abide in it.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd69' href='#dd69'>Dhdas-bh 69</a>When this had been said, Prince, the group of five monks addressed me thus: ‘But you, reverend Gotama, did not come to a state of further-men, to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans by this conduct, by this course, by this practice of austerities. So how can you now come to a state of further-men, to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans when you live in abundance and, wavering in your striving, revert to a life of abundance?’ When this had been said, Prince, I spoke to the group of five monks thus: ‘A Tathāgata, monks, does not live in abundance nor, wavering in striving, does he revert to a life of abundance. The Tathāgata, monks, is one perfected, a fully Self-awakened One. Give ear, monks, the deathless is found, I instruct, I teach Dhamma. Going along in accordance with what is enjoined, having soon realised here and now by your own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, you will abide in it.’ And a second time, Prince, the group of five monks spoke to me thus: ‘But you, reverend Gotama, did not come to a state of further-men, to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans by this conduct, by this course, by this practice of austerities. So how can you now come to a state of further-men, to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans when you live in abundance and, wavering in your striving, revert to a life of abundance?’ When this had been said, Prince, I spoke to the group of five monks thus: ‘A Tathāgata, monks, does not live in abundance nor, wavering in striving, does he revert to a life of abundance. The Tathāgata, monks, is one perfected, a fully Self-awakened One. Give ear, monks, the deathless is found, I instruct, I teach Dhamma. Going along in accordance with what is enjoined, having soon realised here and now by your own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, you will abide in it.’ And a third time, monks, the group of five monks spoke to me thus: ‘But you, reverend Gotama, did not come to a state of further-men, to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans by this conduct, by this course, by this practice of austerities. So how can you now come to a state of further-men, to knowledge and vision befitting the Ariyans when you live in abundance and, wavering in your striving, revert to a life of abundance?’ When this had been said, I, Prince, spoke thus to the group of five monks: ‘Do you allow, monks, that I have ever spoken to you like this before?’ ‘You have not, Lord.’ The Tathāgata, monks, is one perfected, a fully Self-awakened One. Give ear, monks, the deathless is found, I instruct, I teach Dhamma. Going along in accordance with what is enjoined, having soon realised here and now by your own super-knowledge that supreme goal of the Brahmā-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, you will abide in it.’ And I, Prince, was able to convince the group of five monks.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd70' href='#dd70'>Dhdas-bh 70</a>Prince, I now exhorted two monks; three monks walked for almsfood. Whatever the three monks who had walked for alms-food brought back, that the group of six lived on. And then, Prince, I exhorted three monks; two monks walked for almsfood. Whatever the two monks who had walked for almsfood brought back, that the group of six lived on.<span class='note' hidden=''>BD, This may be a later addition: Here the Buddha says he taught while others collected alms food. So, he temporarily stopped collecting almsfood in order to teach.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd71' href='#dd71'>Dhdas-bh 71</a></p>
<h3><span class='add'>How long to realise nibbāna?</span></h3>
<p>When this had been said, Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord: “After how long, revered sir, does a monk taking the Tathāgata as a leader, and having by his own super-knowledge realised here and now that matchless goal of the Brahma-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, entering on it, abide in it?” “Well then, Prince, I will ask you a question about this in return. As it may please you, so should you answer it.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd72' href='#dd72'>Dhdas-bh 72</a>What do you think about this, Prince? Are you skilled in elephant-riding, in the art of handling a goad?” “Yes, I, revered sir, am skilled in elephant-riding, in the art of handling a goad.” “What do you think about this, Prince? A man might come along here, and think: ‘Prince Bodhi knows how to ride elephants and the art of handling the goad.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd73' href='#dd73'>Dhdas-bh 73</a>What do you think about this, Prince? Could that man train himself in elephant-riding and the art of handling the goad under you?” “Assuredly, revered sir, if that man were possessed of (such) qualities, he could not train himself in elephant-riding and the art of handling the goad under me.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd74' href='#dd74'>Dhdas-bh 74</a>“What do you think about this, Prince?

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd80' href='#dd80'>Dhdas-bh 80</a>Let be the one day and night, Prince. If a monk is possessed of these five qualities for striving, taking the Tathāgata as leader, if he is instructed in the evening he will attain eminence in the morning; if he is instructed in the morning he will attain eminence in the evening.” When this had been said, Prince Bodhi spoke thus to the Lord: “O what an Awakened One, O what a dhamma, O what a good teaching of Dhamma in that if one is instructed in the evening he will attain eminence in the morning, if instructed in the morning he will attain eminence in the evening.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd81' href='#dd81'>Dhdas-bh 81</a>When this had been said, the brahman youth Sañjikā's son, spoke thus to Prince Bodhi: “So this revered Bodhi speaks thus: ‘O what an Awakened One, O what a dhamma, O what a good teaching of Dhamma,’ but then he does not say: ‘I am going to that revered Gotama for refuge and to Dhamma and to the Order of monks.’” “Do not, good Sañjikā's son, speak thus; do not, good Sañjikā's son, speak thus. Face to face with my mother, good Sañjikā's son, have I heard this, face to face have I learnt it. There was a time, good Sañjikā's son, when this Lord was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita's monastery. Then my mother, who was with child, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en284' href='#pts-vp-en284'>PTS vp En 284</a> approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, she sat down at a respectful distance. As she was sitting down at a respectful distance my mother spoke thus to the Lord: ‘Revered sir, my unborn child, whether a boy or a girl, is going to the Lord for refuge and to Dhamma and to the Order of monks. May the Lord accept this layfollower who is going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd82' href='#dd82'>Dhdas-bh 82</a>There was the time, good Sañjikā's son, when the Lord was staying here itself among the Bhaggas in Suṅsumāragira in Bhesakaḷā Grove in the deer-park. Then my nurse, carrying me on her hip, approached the Lord; having approached and having greeted the Lord, she stood at a respectful distance. As she was standing at a respectful distance, my nurse spoke thus to the Lord: ‘This, revered sir, is Prince Bodhi who is going for refuge to the Lord and to Dhamma and to the Order of monks. May the Lord accept this layfollower who is going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts.’ Now I, good Sañjikā's son, am going for the third time to the Lord for refuge and to Dhamma and to the Order of monks, thinking: ‘May the Lord accept me as a layfollower going for refuge from this day forth for as long as life lasts.’”</p>
