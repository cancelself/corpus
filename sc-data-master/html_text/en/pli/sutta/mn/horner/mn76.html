<p><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli513' href='#pts-vp-pli513'>PTS vp Pali 513</a> <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en192' href='#pts-vp-en192'>PTS vp En 192</a> <a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> at one time the Lord was staying near Kosambī in Ghosita's monastery. Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was staying in the Fig Tree Cave with a great company of wanderers, with at least five hundred wanderers. Then the venerable Ānanda, emerging from solitude towards evening, addressed the monks, saying: “Come, your reverences, we will go to Devakaṭa Pool so as to see the Cave.” “Yes, your reverence,” these monks answered the venerable Ānanda in assent. Then the venerable Ānanda, together with many monks, approached Devakaṭa Pool. Now at that time the wanderer Sandaka was sitting down with the great company of wanderers shouting out with a loud noise, a great noise, talking various kinds of inferior talk, that is to say: talk on kings, thieves, great ministers, armies, fears, battles, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, scents, relations, vehicles, villages, market towns, towns, the country, women, heroes, streets, wells, those departed before, talk of diversity, speculation about the world, speculation about the sea, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli514' href='#pts-vp-pli514'>PTS vp Pali 514</a>talk about becoming or not becoming thus or thus. The wanderer Sandaka saw the venerable Ānanda coming in the distance; seeing him, he called his own company to order, saying: “Good sirs, let there be little noise; do not, good sirs, make a noise; this is a disciple of the recluse Gotama who is coming, the recluse Ānanda. For as long as disciples of the recluse Gotama have <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en193' href='#pts-vp-en193'>PTS vp En 193</a> been staying near Kosambī the recluse Ānanda has been among them. These venerable ones wish for little noise, they are trained to little noise, they are praisers of little noise. So he may consider approaching if he knows that this is a company of little noise.” Then these wanderers fell silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>Then the venerable Ānanda approached the wanderer Sandaka. The wanderer Sandaka spoke thus to the venerable Ānanda: “Let the revered Ānanda come, there is a welcome for the revered Ānanda; it is long since the revered Ānanda made this opportunity, that is to say for coming here. Let the revered Ānanda sit down, this seat is ready.” Then the venerable Ānanda sat down on the seat that was ready. And the wanderer Sandaka, having taken a low seat, sat down at a respectful distance. Then the venerable Ānanda spoke thus to the wanderer Sandaka as he was sitting down at a respectful distance: “What is the talk for which you are now gathered together here, Sandaka? And what was your talk that was interrupted?” “Let be that talk, good Ānanda, for which we are now gathered together here. It will not be difficult for the good Ānanda to hear this talk later. It were good if some Dhamma-talk belonging to his own teacher were to occur to the revered Ānanda himself.” “Well then, Sandaka, listen, attend carefully and I will speak.” “Yes, sir,” the wanderer Sandaka answered the venerable Ānanda in assent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>The venerable Ānanda spoke thus: “Sandaka, these four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring have been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One; and four comfortless Brahma-farings have been pointed out in which an intelligent man could certainly not live a Brahma-faring, or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.” “And what, good Ānanda, are these four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring that have been pointed out by the Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One in which <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli515' href='#pts-vp-pli515'>PTS vp Pali 515</a>an intelligent man could certainly not live a Brahma-faring, or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>“As to this, Sandaka, some teacher speaks thus and is of this view: ‘There is no (result of) gift, no (result of) sacrifice; there is no <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en194' href='#pts-vp-en194'>PTS vp En 194</a> fruit or ripening of deeds well done or ill done; there is not this world, there is not a world beyond; there is not (benefit from serving) mother or father; there are no beings of spontaneous uprising; there are not in the world recluses and brahmans who are faring rightly, proceeding rightly, and who proclaim this world and a world beyond, having realised them by their own super-knowledge. This man is derived from the four great elements so that, when he passes away, the earthy part of his body returns and relapses to earth, the fluid part to water, the hot part to heat, the windy part to wind, and his sense-organs pass over into the ether. Four men, with a bier as the fifth, go along taking the corpse; as far as the cemetery they make known his characteristics. His bones become pigeon-grey. Offerings end as ashes. It is imbeciles who speak of giving. It is vain, lying, empty talk on their part who profess to say: There is. Fools and wise alike are annihilated and destroyed at the breaking up of the body; after dying they are not.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent man reflects thus: ‘This worthy teacher speaks thus and is of this view: “There is no (result of) gift, no (result of) sacrifice; there is no fruit or ripening of deeds well done or ill done; there is not this world, there is not a world beyond; there is not (benefit from serving) mother or father; there are no beings of spontaneous uprising; there are not in the world recluses and brahmans who are faring rightly, proceeding rightly, and who proclaim this world and a world beyond, having realised them by their own super-knowledge.

It is imbeciles who speak of giving. It is vain, lying, empty talk on their part who profess to say: There is. Fools and wise alike are annihilated and destroyed at the breaking up of the body; after dying they are not.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>If this is a true word of this good teacher, then what is done herein is without my doing it, what is lived herein is without my living it. Moreover both of us are herein on an exact level in attaining recluseship, although I do not say: “We will both be annihilated and destroyed at the breaking up of the body; after dying we will not be.” It is excessive of this good teacher to be naked, shaven, to practise squatting on his heels, to pluck out the hair of his head and beard, while I am living in a house surrounded and supported by sons, delighting in Kāsi's sandal-wood perfumes, decked with garlands, scents and unguents, enjoying the use of gold and silver. For in a future state I will be on an exact level in wayfaring as this good teacher. Knowing what, seeing what, should I fare the Brahma-faring under this teacher?’ He, realising that this is a way of living a non-Brahma-faring, goes away uninterested in this Brahma-faring. This, Sandaka, is the first way of living a non-Brahma-faring that <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en195' href='#pts-vp-en195'>PTS vp En 195</a> has been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, (a way) in which an intelligent man could certainly not <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli516' href='#pts-vp-pli516'>PTS vp Pali 516</a>live a Brahma-faring or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>And again, Sandaka, some teacher here speaks thus and is of this view: ‘From doing, from making (another) do, from mutilating, from making (another) mutilate, from threatening, from making (another) threaten, from causing grief, from tormenting, from torturing, from making (another) torture, from making onslaught on creatures, from taking what is not given, from house-breaking, from plundering, from robbery, from waiting in ambush, from going after other men's wives, from lying speech, from acting (thus) evil is not done. If anyone with a discus having an edge sharp as a razor should make the creatures of this earth into one mass of flesh, into one heap of flesh, from that source there is not evil, there is not the perpetuating of evil. And if anyone should go to the south bank of the Ganges slaying and striking, mutilating, making (others) mutilate, threatening, making (others) threaten, from that source there is not evil, there is not the perpetuating of evil. And if he should go to the north bank of the Ganges giving, making (others) give, offering, making (others) offer, from that source there is not merit, there is not the perpetuating of merit. There is no merit from giving, from taming oneself, from restraining oneself, from truth-speaking, there is not the perpetuating of merit.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent man reflects thus: ‘This worthy teacher speaks thus and is of this view: “From doing, from making (another) do, from mutilating, from making (another) mutilate, from threatening, from making (another) threaten, from causing grief, from tormenting, from torturing, from making (another) torture, from making onslaught on creatures, from taking what is not given, from house-breaking, from plundering, from robbery, from waiting in ambush, from going after other men's wives, from lying speech, from acting (thus) evil is not done.

There is no merit from giving, from taming oneself, from restraining oneself, from truth-speaking, there is not the perpetuating of merit.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>If this is a true word of this good teacher, then what is done herein is without my doing it, what is lived herein is without my living it. Moreover both of us are herein on an exact level in attaining recluse-ship, although I do not say: “Evil will not be done by the deeds of both.” It is excessive of this good teacher to be naked, shaven, to practise squatting on his heels, to pluck out the hair of his head and beard, while I am living in a house surrounded and supported by sons, delighting in Kāsi's sandal-wood perfumes, decked with garlands, scents and unguents, enjoying the use of gold and silver.

Knowing what, seeing what, should I fare the Brahma-faring under this teacher?’ He, realising that this is a way of living a non-Brahma-faring, goes away uninterested in this Brahma-faring. This, Sandaka, is the second way of living a non-Brahma-faring that has been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, (a way) in which an intelligent man could certainly not live a Brahma-faring or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>And again, Sandaka, some teacher here speaks thus and is of this view: ‘There is no cause, no reason for the defilement of creatures, creatures are defiled without cause, without reason. There is no cause, no reason for the purification of creatures, creatures are purified without cause, without reason. There is not strength, there is not energy, there is not human vigour, there is not human effort; all creatures, all breathing things, all beings, all living things are without power, without strength, without energy, bent by fate, chance, and nature, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli517' href='#pts-vp-pli517'>PTS vp Pali 517</a>they experience pleasure and pain amid the six classes.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent man reflects thus: ‘This worthy teacher speaks thus and is of this view: ‘There is no cause, no reason for the defilement of creatures, creatures are defiled without cause, without reason. There is no cause, no reason for the purification of creatures, creatures are purified without cause, without reason.

Knowing what, seeing what, should I fare the Brahma-faring under this teacher?’ He, realising that <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en196' href='#pts-vp-en196'>PTS vp En 196</a> this is a way of living a non-Brahma-faring, goes away uninterested in this Brahma-faring. This, Sandaka, is the third way of living a non-Brahma-faring that has been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, (a way) in which an intelligent man could certainly not live a Brahma-faring or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>And again, Sandaka, some teacher here speaks thus and is of this view:’ These seven classes are not made or caused to be made, they are not created or caused to be created, they are barren (of results), standing stable as a mountain, stable as a pillar, they do not move or change or injure one another, they are unable to affect one another's pleasure or pain or pleasure-and-pain. What are the seven? Earth, water, heat, wind, pleasures, pains, life-principles, these seven. These seven classes are not made or caused to be made, they are not created or caused to be created, they are barren (of results), standing stable as a mountain, stable as a pillar, they do not move or change or injure one another, they are unable to affect one another's pleasure or pain or pleasure-and-pain. Herein there is neither slayer nor one that makes another slay, neither hearer nor one that makes another hear, neither knower nor one that makes another know. Even he who cuts off (another's) head with a sharp sword deprives no one of life, for the sword merely penetrates the gap between the seven classes.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a>There are these fourteen hundred thousand chief kinds of birth, and sixty hundred and six hundred. There are five hundred karmas and (another) five karmas and (another) three karmas. There is a karma and half a karma. There are sixty-two practices, sixty-two sub-divisions (in a great kalpa), six classes <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en197' href='#pts-vp-en197'>PTS vp En 197</a> of mankind, eight stages in (the life of a) man, forty-nine hundred modes of livelihood, forty-nine hundred wanderers, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli518' href='#pts-vp-pli518'>PTS vp Pali 518</a>forty-nine hundred nāga-dwellings, twenty hundred faculties, thirty hundred Niraya Hells, thirty-six places where dust collects, seven births where there is consciousness, seven births where there is no consciousness, seven kinds of production where there are joints in the stalk, seven kinds of devas, seven kinds of men, seven kinds of demons, seven lakes, seven knots, seven (greater) mountains, seven hundred (smaller) mountains, seven (great) dreams, seven hundred (lesser) dreams. There are 84,000 great kalpas in which both fools and the wise, when they have run on and circled on, will make an end of anguish.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>It is useless to say: “I, by this moral practice or habit or austerity or Brahma-faring will bring an unmatured karma to maturity, or gradually exhaust karma already matured.” This is <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en198' href='#pts-vp-en198'>PTS vp En 198</a> not so. Happiness and pain are measured out (as) in a bushel; circling on has its limits fixed; there is not decline and growth, there is not high degree or low. Indeed, just as a ball of thread, when thrown down, unwinds itself as it rolls, even so will fools and the wise alike, when they have run on and circled on, make an end of anguish.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd16' href='#dd16'>Dhdas-bh 16</a>Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent man reflects thus: ‘This worthy teacher speaks thus and is of this view: These seven classes are not made or caused to be made, they are not created or caused to be created, they are barren (of results), standing stable as a mountain, stable as a pillar, they do not move or change or injure one another, they are unable to affect one another's pleasure or pain or pleasure-and-pain.

This, Sandaka, is the fourth way of living a non-Brahma-faring that has been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, (a way) in which an intelligent man could certainly not live a Brahma-faring or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd21' href='#dd21'>Dhdas-bh 21</a>These, Sandaka, are the four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring that have been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli519' href='#pts-vp-pli519'>PTS vp Pali 519</a>and in which an intelligent man could certainly not live a Brahma-faring, or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd22' href='#dd22'>Dhdas-bh 22</a>“It is wonderful, good Ānanda, it is marvellous, good Ānanda, that although there are these four ways of living a non-Brahma-faring, they have been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, as those in which an intelligent man could certainly not live a Brahma-faring, or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled. But now, good Ānanda, what are these four comfortless Brahma-farings that have been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, and in which an intelligent man certainly could not live a Brahma-faring, or, if living <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en199' href='#pts-vp-en199'>PTS vp En 199</a> it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd23' href='#dd23'>Dhdas-bh 23</a>“As to this, Sandaka, some teacher, all-knowing, all-seeing, claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision, saying: ‘Whether I am walking or standing still or asleep or awake, knowledge-and-vision is constantly and perpetually before me.’ He enters an empty place, and he does not obtain almsfood, and a dog bites him, and he encounters a fierce elephant, and he encounters a fierce horse, and he encounters a fierce bullock, and he asks a woman and a man their name and clan, and he asks the name of a village or a market town and the way. He, being one who asks, ‘How was this?’ answers, ‘I had to enter an empty place, therefore I entered; I had to obtain no almsfood, therefore I obtained none; (someone) had to be bitten by a dog, therefore I was bitten by one; (someone) had to encounter a fierce elephant, horse and bullock, therefore I encountered them; (someone) had to ask a woman and a man their name and clan, therefore I asked; (someone) had to ask the name of a village and market town and the way, therefore I asked.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd24' href='#dd24'>Dhdas-bh 24</a>Whereupon, Sandaka, an intelligent person reflects thus: ‘This revered teacher, all-knowing, all-seeing, claims all-embracing knowledge-and-vision, saying: “Whether I am walking or standing still or asleep or awake, knowledge-and-vision is constantly and perpetually before me.” He enters an empty place, and he does not obtain almsfood, and a dog bites him, and he encounters a fierce elephant, and he encounters a fierce horse, and he encounters a fierce bullock, and he asks a woman and a man their name and clan, and he asks the name of a village or a market town and the way.

This, Sandaka, is the first comfortless Brahma-faring that has been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, and <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli520' href='#pts-vp-pli520'>PTS vp Pali 520</a>in which an intelligent man certainly could not live a Brahma-faring, or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd25' href='#dd25'>Dhdas-bh 25</a>And again, Sandaka, some teacher here depends on report, holds to report for his ‘truths,’ he teaches Dhamma according to report, according to hearsay and tradition, according to the authority of the collections. If a teacher, Sandaka, depends on report, holds to report for his ‘truths,’ he remembers (part) well and he remembers (part) badly, and is both right and wrong.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd26' href='#dd26'>Dhdas-bh 26</a>Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent person reflects thus: ‘This worthy teacher depends on report, holds to report for his ‘truths,’ he teaches Dhamma according to report, according to hearsay and tradition, according to the authority of the collections. If a teacher depends on report, holds to report for his ‘truths,’ he remembers (part) well and he remembers (part) badly, and is both right and wrong.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd27' href='#dd27'>Dhdas-bh 27</a>And again, Sandaka, some teacher here is a reasoner and investigator; he teaches Dhamma on a system of his own devising, beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation. If, Sandaka, a teacher is a reasoner and investigator, part is well reasoned and part is badly reasoned, and is both right and wrong. Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent person reflects thus: ‘This worthy teacher is a reasoner and investigator he teaches Dhamma on a system of his own devising, beaten out by reasoning and based on investigation. If a teacher is a reasoner and investigator, part is well reasoned and part is badly reasoned, and is both right and wrong.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd28' href='#dd28'>Dhdas-bh 28</a>And again, Sandaka, some teacher here is stupid and confused; because of his stupidity and confusion, on being asked a question on this or that <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli521' href='#pts-vp-pli521'>PTS vp Pali 521</a>he falls into equivocation, into eel-wriggling: ‘It is not thus for me, it is not so for me, it is not otherwise for me, I do not say it is not, I do not say it is not not.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd29' href='#dd29'>Dhdas-bh 29</a>Wherefore, Sandaka, an intelligent person reflects thus: ‘This worthy teacher is stupid and confused because of his stupidity and confusion, on being asked a question on this or that he falls into equivocation, into eel-wriggling: ‘It is not thus for me, it is not so for me, it is not otherwise for me, I do not say it is not, I do not say it is not not.’ Having realised that this Brahma-faring is comfortless, he goes away uninterested in this Brahma-faring. This, Sandaka, is the fourth comfortless Brahma-faring that has been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, and in which an intelligent man certainly could not live a Brahma-faring, or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd30' href='#dd30'>Dhdas-bh 30</a>These, Sandaka, are the four comfortless Brahma-farings that have been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, and in which an intelligent man certainly could not live a Brahma-faring, or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd31' href='#dd31'>Dhdas-bh 31</a>“It is wonderful, good Ānanda, it is marvellous, good Ānanda, that these four comfortless Brahma-farings have been pointed out by this Lord who knows and sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, as those in which an intelligent man could certainly not live a Brahma-faring or, if living it, could not gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd32' href='#dd32'>Dhdas-bh 32</a>Good Ānanda, what does this Teacher teach, what does he profess whereby an intelligent man <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en201' href='#pts-vp-en201'>PTS vp En 201</a> could certainly live a Brahma-faring and, living it, could gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled?” “As to this, Sandaka, <span class='add'>[1]</span> a Tathagata arises in the world, a perfected one, a fully Self-awakened one endowed with right knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of the worlds, the matchless charioteer of men to be tamed, the Awakened One, the Lord. He makes known this world with the devas, with Māra, with Brahmā, creation with its recluses and brahmans, its devas and men, having realised them by his own super-knowledge. He teaches Dhamma which is lovely at the beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending, with the spirit and the letter; he proclaims the Brahma-faring wholly fulfilled, quite purified. A householder or a householder's son or one born in another family hears that Dhamma. <span class='add'>[2]</span> Having heard that Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathāgata. <span class='add'>[3]</span> Endowed with this faith that he has acquired, he reflects in this way: ‘The household life is confined and dusty; going forth is of the open; it is not easy for one who lives in a house to fare the Brahma-faring wholly fulfilled, wholly pure, polished like a conch-shell. Suppose now that I, having cut off hair and beard, having put on saffron robes, should go forth from home into homelessness?’ After a time, getting rid of his wealth, be it small or great, getting rid of his circle of relations, be it small or great, having cut off his hair and beard, having put on saffron robes, he goes forth from home into homelessness. <span class='add'>[4]</span> He, being thus one who has gone forth and who is endowed with the training and the way of living of monks, abandoning onslaught on creatures, is one who abstains from onslaught on creatures; the stick laid aside, the knife laid aside, he lives kindly, scrupulous, friendly and compassionate towards all breathing things and creatures. <span class='add'>[5]</span> Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he is one who abstains from taking what is not given; being one who takes (only) what is given, who waits for what is given, not by stealing he lives with a self become pure. <span class='add'>[6]</span> Abandoning unchastity, he is one who is chaste, keeping remote (from unchastity), abstaining from dealings with women. <span class='add'>[7]</span> Abandoning lying speech, he is one who abstains from lying speech, a truth-speaker, a bondsman to truth, trustworthy, dependable, no deceiver of the world. <span class='add'>[8]</span> Abandoning slanderous speech, he is one who abstains from slanderous speech; having heard something here he is not one for repeating it elsewhere for (causing) variance among these (people), or having heard something elsewhere he is not one to repeat it there for (causing) variance among these (people). In this way he is a reconciler of those who are at variance, and one who combines those who are friends. Concord is his pleasure, concord his delight, concord his joy, concord is the motive of his speech. <span class='add'>[9]</span> Abandoning harsh speech, he is one who abstains from harsh speech. Whatever speech is gentle, pleasing to the ear, affectionate, going to the heart, urbane, pleasant to the manyfolk, agreeable to the manyfolk, he comes to be one who utters speech like this. <span class='add'>[10]</span> Abandoning frivolous chatter, he is one who abstains from frivolous chatter. He is a speaker at a right time, a speaker of fact, a speaker on the goal, a speaker on Dhamma, a speaker on discipline, he speaks words that are worth treasuring, with similes at a right time that are discriminating, connected with the goal. <span class='add'>[11]</span> He comes to be one who abstains from what involves destruction to seed-growth, to vegetable growth. <span class='add'>[12]</span> He comes to be one who eats one meal a day, refraining at night, abstaining from eating at a wrong time. <span class='add'>[13]</span> He comes to be one who abstains from watching shows of dancing, singing, music. <span class='add'>[14]</span> He comes to be one who abstains from using garlands, scents, unguents, adornments, finery. <span class='add'>[15]</span> He comes to be one who abstains from using high beds, large beds. <span class='add'>[16]</span> He comes to be one who abstains from accepting gold and silver. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting raw grain. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting raw meat. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting women and girls. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting women slaves and men slaves. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting fowl and swine. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting elephants, cows, horses, mares. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting fields and sites. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting messages or going on such. <span class='add'>[17]</span> He comes to be one who abstains from buying and selling. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting from cheating with weights. He comes to be one who abstains from accepting from cheating with bronzes. He comes to be one who abstains from cheating with measures. He comes to be one who abstains from the crooked ways of bribery, fraud and deceit. <span class='add'>[18]</span> He comes to be one who abstains from maiming, murdering, manacling, highway robbery. <span class='add'>[19]</span> He comes to be contented with the robes for protecting his body, with the almsfood for sustaining his stomach. Wherever he goes he takes these things with him as he goes. As a bird on the wing wherever it flies takes its’ wings with it as it flies, so a monk, contented with the robes for protecting his body, with the almsfood for sustaining his stomach, wherever he goes takes these things with him as he goes. <span class='add'>[20]</span> He, possessed of the ariyan body of moral habit, subjectively experiences unsullied well-being. <span class='add'>[21-1]</span> Having seen a material shape with the eye, he is not entranced by the general appearance, he is not entranced by the detail. If he dwells with this organ of sight uncontrolled, covetousness and dejection, evil unskilled states of mind, might predominate. So he fares along controlling it; he guards the organ of sight, he comes to control over the organ of sight. <span class='add'>[21-2]</span> Having heard a sound with the ear, he is not entranced by the general appearance, he is not entranced by the detail. If he dwells with this organ of hearing uncontrolled, covetousness and dejection, evil unskilled states of mind, might predominate. So he fares along controlling it; he guards the organ of hearing, he comes to control over the organ of hearing. <span class='add'>[21-3]</span> Having smelt a smell with the nose, he is not entranced by the general appearance, he is not entranced by the detail. If he dwells with this organ of smell uncontrolled, covetousness and dejection, evil unskilled states of mind, might predominate. So he fares along controlling it; he guards the organ of smell, he comes to control over the organ of smell. <span class='add'>[21-4]</span> Having savoured a taste with the tongue, he is not entranced by the general appearance, he is not entranced by the detail. If he dwells with this organ of taste uncontrolled, covetousness and dejection, evil unskilled states of mind, might predominate. So he fares along controlling it; he guards the organ of taste, he comes to control over the organ of taste. <span class='add'>[21-5]</span> Having felt a touch with the body, he is not entranced by the general appearance, he is not entranced by the detail. If he dwells with this organ of touch uncontrolled, covetousness and dejection, evil unskilled states of mind, might predominate. So he fares along controlling it; he guards the organ of touch, he comes to control over the organ of touch. <span class='add'>[21-6]</span> Having cognised a mental object with the mind, he is not entranced by the general appearance, he is not entranced by the detail. If he lives with this organ of mind uncontrolled, covetousness and dejection, evil unskilled states of mind might predominate. So he fares along controlling it; he guards the organ of mind, he comes to control over the organ of mind. If he is possessed of this ariyan control of the (sense-) organs, he subjectively experiences unsullied well-being.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd33' href='#dd33'>Dhdas-bh 33</a><span class='add'>[22]</span> Whether he is setting out or returning, he is one who comports himself properly; whether he is looking down or looking round, he is one who comports himself properly; whether he is bending back or stretching out (his arm), he is one who comports himself properly; whether he is carrying his outer cloak, his bowl, his robe, he is one who comports himself properly; whether he is munching, drinking, eating, savouring, he is one who comports himself properly; whether he is obeying the calls of nature, he is one who comports himself properly; whether he is walking, standing, asleep, awake, talking, silent, he is one who comports himself properly. Possessed of this ariyan body of moral habit and possessed of this ariyan control of the (sense-) organs and possessed of this ariyan mindfulness and clear consciousness, <span class='add'>[23]</span> he chooses a remote lodging in a forest, at the root of a tree, on a mountain slope, in a wilderness, in a hill-cave, in a cemetery, in a forest haunt, in the open or on a heap of straw.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd34' href='#dd34'>Dhdas-bh 34</a><span class='add'>[24]</span> He, returning from alms-gathering after his meal, sits down cross-legged holding the back erect, having made mindfulness rise up in front of him. <span class='add'>[25-1]</span> He, having got rid of covetousness for the world, lives with a mind devoid of coveting, he purifies the mind of coveting. <span class='add'>[25-2]</span> By getting rid of the taint of ill-will, he lives benevolent in mind; and compassionate for the welfare of all creatures and beings, he purifies the mind of the taint of ill-will. <span class='add'>[25-3]</span> By getting rid of sloth and torpor, he lives devoid of sloth and torpor; perceiving the light, mindful and clearly conscious, he purifies the mind of sloth and torpor. <span class='add'>[25-4]</span> By getting rid of restlessness and worry, he lives calmly, the mind subjectively tranquillised, he purifies the mind of restlessness and worry. <span class='add'>[25-5]</span> By getting rid of doubt, he lives doubt-crossed; unperplexed as to the states that are skilled, he purifies his mind of doubt.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd35' href='#dd35'>Dhdas-bh 35</a><span class='add'>[26-1]</span> He, by getting rid Of these five hindrances, defilements of a mind and weakening to intuitive wisdom, aloof from pleasurs of the senses, aloof from unskilled states of mind, enters and abides in the first meditation, which is accompanied by initial thought and discursive thought, is born of aloofness and is rapturous and joyful. If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli522' href='#pts-vp-pli522'>PTS vp Pali 522</a>an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and, living it, could gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd36' href='#dd36'>Dhdas-bh 36</a><span class='add'>[26-2]</span> And again, Sandaka, a monk, by allaying initial and discursive thought, his mind subjectively tranquillised and fixed on one point, enters on and abides in the second meditation which is devoid of initial and discursive thought, is born of concentration and is rapturous and joyful. If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher, an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and, living it, could gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd37' href='#dd37'>Dhdas-bh 37</a><span class='add'>[26-3]</span> And again, Sandaka, a monk, by the fading out of rapture, dwells with equanimity, attentive and clearly conscious, and experiences in his person that joy of which the ariyans say: ‘Joyful lives he who has equanimity and is mindful,’ and he enters on and abides in the third meditation. If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher, an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and, living it, could gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd38' href='#dd38'>Dhdas-bh 38</a><span class='add'>[26-4]</span> And again, Sandaka, a monk by getting rid of joy, by getting rid of anguish, by the going down of his former pleasures and sorrows, enters on and abides in the fourth meditation which has neither anguish nor joy, and which is entirely purified by equanimity and mindfulness. If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher, an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and, living it, could gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd39' href='#dd39'>Dhdas-bh 39</a><span class='add'>[27-1]</span> Thus with the mind composed, quite purified, quite clarified, without blemish, without defilement, grown soft and workable, stable, immovable, he directs his mind to the knowledge and recollection of former habitations. He recollects a variety of former habitations, thus: One birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, and many an eon of integration and many an eon of disintegration and many an eon of integration-disintegration: ‘Such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so I was nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I came to be in another state where I was such a one by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so I was nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I arose here.’ Thus he recollects divers former habitations in all their modes and detail.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd40' href='#dd40'>Dhdas-bh 40</a><span class='add'>[27-2]</span> With the mind composed thus, quite purified, quite clarified, without blemish, without defilement, grown soft and workable, stable, immovable, he directs his mind to the knowledge of the passing hence and the arising of beings. With the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, he sees beings as they pass hence or come to be; he comprehends that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going, according to the consequences of deeds, and thinks: ‘Indeed these worthy beings who were possessed of wrong conduct in body, speech and thought, scoffers at the ariyans, holding a wrong view, incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body, speech and thought, who did not scoff at the ariyans, holding a right view, incurring deeds consequent on a right view, these at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world.’ Thus with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men does he see beings as they pass hence, as they arise; he comprehends that beings are mean, excellent, comely, ugly, well-going, ill-going according to the consequences of deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd41' href='#dd41'>Dhdas-bh 41</a><span class='add'>[27-3]</span> With the mind composed thus, quite purified, quite clarified, without blemish, without defilement, grown soft and workable, stable, immovable, he directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the cankers. He comprehends as it really is: ‘This is anguish’, ‘this is the arising of anguish’, ‘this is the stopping of anguish’, ‘this is the course leading to the stopping of anguish’. He comprehends as it really is: ‘These are the cankers’, ‘this is the arising of the cankers’, ‘this is the stopping of the cankers’, ‘this is the course leading to the stopping of the cankers’. Knowing thus, seeing thus, his mind is freed from the canker of sense-pleasures and his mind is freed from the canker of becoming and his mind is freed from the canker of ignorance.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd42' href='#dd42'>Dhdas-bh 42</a><span class='add'>[28]</span> In freedom the knowledge comes to be: ‘I am freed’; and he comprehends: ‘Destroyed is birth, brought to a close the Brahma-faring, done is what was to be done, there is no more of being such or so.’ If a disciple attains such lofty eminence under this Teacher, an intelligent person could certainly live that Brahma-faring and, living it, could gain success in the right path, in Dhamma, in what is skilled.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd43' href='#dd43'>Dhdas-bh 43</a>“But, good Ānanda, could that monk who is a perfected one, the cankers destroyed, who has lived the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed, freed by perfect profound knowledge, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli523' href='#pts-vp-pli523'>PTS vp Pali 523</a>could he enjoy pleasures of the senses?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd44' href='#dd44'>Dhdas-bh 44</a>“Whatever monk, Sandaka, is a perfected one the cankers destroyed, who has lived the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed, freed by perfect profound knowledge, he cannot become one to transgress five points: <span class='add'>[1]</span> a monk whose cankers are destroyed cannot become one intentionally to deprive a living creature of life; <span class='add'>[2]</span> a monk whose cankers are destroyed cannot become one to take what has not been given, as it were by theft; <span class='add'>[3]</span> a monk whose cankers are destroyed cannot become one to indulge in sexual intercourse; <span class='add'>[4]</span> a monk whose cankers are destroyed cannot become one to speak a deliberate lie; <span class='add'>[5]</span> a monk whose cankers are destroyed cannot become one to enjoy pleasures of the senses in <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en202' href='#pts-vp-en202'>PTS vp En 202</a> regard to what was stored as he did formerly when in the household state. Sandaka, whatever is a perfected one the cankers destroyed, who has lived the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed, freed by perfect profound knowledge, he cannot become one to transgress these five points.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd45' href='#dd45'>Dhdas-bh 45</a>“But, good Ānanda, if a monk is one perfected the cankers destroyed, who has lived the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed, freed by perfect profound knowledge, then, whether he is walking or standing still or asleep or awake is the knowledge-and-vision constantly and perpetually present that his cankers are destroyed?” “Well then, Sandaka, I will make you a simile, for by a simile some intelligent persons here understand the meaning of what has been said.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd46' href='#dd46'>Dhdas-bh 46</a>Sandaka, it is like a man whose hands and feet have been cut off; whether he is walking or standing still or asleep or awake, constantly and perpetually are his hands and feet as though cut off; and moreover while he is reflecting on it, he knows: ‘My hands and feet have been cut off.’ Even so, Sandaka, whatever monk is a perfected one, the cankers destroyed, who has lived the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, attained his own goal, the fetters of becoming utterly destroyed, freed by perfect profound knowledge, for him whether he is walking or standing still or asleep or awake, the cankers are as though destroyed; and moreover while he is reflecting on it, he knows: ‘My cankers are destroyed.’”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd47' href='#dd47'>Dhdas-bh 47</a>“How many great leaders, good Ānanda, are there in this Dhamma and discipline?” “Not merely a hundred, nor two, three, four or five hundred, but far more are those who are great leaders in this Dhamma and discipline.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd48' href='#dd48'>Dhdas-bh 48</a>“Wonderful, good Ānanda, marvellous, good Ānanda; there can be no extolling of their own dhamma, nor disparaging of the dhamma of others; but both the teaching of Dhamma in its (whole) extent and so <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli524' href='#pts-vp-pli524'>PTS vp Pali 524</a>many great leaders can be seen. On the other hand, these Naked Ascetics are children of a childless mother, they both extol themselves and disparage others, and they show only three great leaders, namely Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca and Makkhali Gosāla”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd49' href='#dd49'>Dhdas-bh 49</a>Then the wanderer Sandaka addressed his own company, saying: “Let the good sirs fare forth; the living of the Brahma-faring is <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en203' href='#pts-vp-en203'>PTS vp En 203</a> under the recluse Gotama, although it is not easy for us now to give up gains, honours, fame.” It was in this way that the wanderer Sandaka sent his own company into the Lord's Brahma-faring.</p>
