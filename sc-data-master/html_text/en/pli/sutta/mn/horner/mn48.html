<h1>48. Discourse at Kosambī</h1>
</header>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> At one time the Lord was staying near Kosambī in Ghosita's monastery. Now at that time, the monks of Kosambī, disputatious, quarrelsome, contentious, lived wounding another with the weapons of the tongue. They neither convinced one another nor came to be convinced themselves, nor did they win one another over or come to be won over themselves. Then a certain monk approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, that monk spoke thus to the Lord: “Now, Lord, the monks of Kosambī, disputatious, quarrelsome, contentious, live wounding another with the weapons of the tongue. They neither convinced one another nor came to be convinced themselves, nor did they win one another over or come to be won over themselves.” Then the Lord addressed a certain monk, saying: “Come you, monk, summon these monks in my name, saying: ‘The Teacher is summoning you.’” “Yes, Lord,” and this monk, having answered the Lord in assent, approached those monks; having approached, he spoke thus to those monks: “The Teacher is summoning the venerable ones.” “Yes, your reverence,” and those monks having answered that monk in assent, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, they sat down at a respectful distance. The Lord spoke thus to those monks as they were sitting down at a respectful distance:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>“Is it true, as is said, that you, monks, are disputatious, quarrelsome, contentious, and live wounding another with the weapons of the tongue. That you neither convince one another nor came to be convinced yourselves, that you neither win one another over nor are won over yourselves?” <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en384' href='#pts-vp-en384'>PTS vp En 384</a> “Yes, Lord.” “What do you think about this, monks? At the time when you, disputatious, quarrelsome, contentious, live wounding one another with the weapon of the tongue, is a friendly act of body offered your fellow Brahma-farers, both in public and in private? Is a friendly act of speech offered your fellow Brahma-farers, both in public and in private? Is a friendly act of thought offered your fellow Brahma-farers, both in public and in private?” “No, Lord.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>“Then it is to be said, monks, that at that time when you, disputatious, quarrelsome, contentious, live wounding one another with the weapons of the tongue, at that time no friendly act of body is offered your fellow Brahma-farers, both in public and in private no friendly act of speech is offered your fellow Brahma-farers, both in public and in private no friendly act of thought is offered your fellow Brahma-farers, either in public or in private. Therefore, knowing what, seeing what, is it that you, foolish men, disputatious, quarrelsome, contentious, live wounding one another with the weapons of the tongue? You neither convince one another nor are convinced yourselves, neither do you win one another over nor are won over yourselves. So this, foolish men, will be for a long time for your woe and sorrow.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: “Monks, these six things are to be remembered; making for affection, making for respect, they conduce to concord, to lack of contention, to harmony and unity. What six? <span class='add'>(1)</span> Herein, monks, a monk should offer his fellow Brahma-farers a friendly act of body both in public and in private. This is a thing to be remembered, making for affection, making for respect, which conduces to concord, to lack of contention, harmony and unity. <span class='add'>(2)</span> And again, monks, a monk should offer a friendly act of speech both in public and in private. This is a thing to be remembered, making for affection, making for respect, which conduces to concord, to lack of contention, harmony and unity. <span class='add'>(3)</span> And again, monks, a monk should offer a friendly act of thought both in public and in private. This is a thing to be remembered, making for affection, making for respect, which conduces to concord, to lack of contention, harmony and unity. <span class='add'>(4)</span> And again, monks, whatever those lawful acquisitions, lawfully acquired, if they be even but what is put into the begging bowl, a monk should be one to enjoy sharing such acquisitions, to enjoy them in common with his virtuous fellow Brahma-farers. This too is a thing to be remembered, making for affection, making for respect, which conduces to concord, to lack of contention, harmony and unity. <span class='add'>(5)</span> And again, monks, whatever those moral habits that are faultless, without flaw, spotless, without blemish, freeing, praised by wise men, untarnished, conducive to concentration, a monk should dwell united in virtues such as <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en385' href='#pts-vp-en385'>PTS vp En 385</a> these with his fellow Brahma-farers, both in public and in private. This too is a thing to be remembered, making for affection, making for respect, which conduces to concord, to lack of contention, harmony and unity. <span class='add'>(6)</span> And again, monks, whatever view is ariyan, leading onwards, leading him who acts according to it to the complete destruction of anguish, a monk should dwell united in a view such as this with his fellow Brahma-farers, both in public and in private. This too is a thing to be remembered, making for affection, making for respect, which conduces to concord, to lack of contention, harmony and unity.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Monks, these are the six things to be remembered, making for affection, making for respect, which conduce to concord, to lack of contention, to harmony and unity. And, monks, of these six things to be remembered, this is the topmost, this the roof-plate, this the dome, that is to say whatever view is ariyan, leading onwards, leading him who acts according to it to the complete destruction of anguish. As, monks, in a house with a peaked roof, this is the topmost, the roof-plate, the dome, that is to say the peak, even so, monks, of these six things to be remembered, this is the topmost, this the roof-plate, this the dome, that is to say whatever view is ariyan, leading onwards, leading him who acts according to it to the complete destruction of anguish.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>And what, monks, is that view which is ariyan, leading onwards, and which leads him who acts according to it to the complete destruction of anguish? Herein, monks, a monk who is forest-gone or gone to the root of a tree or gone to an empty place, reflects like this; ‘Now, have I a subjective obsession, not got rid of, owing to which I, if my mind were obsessed by it, could not know, could not see (things) as they really are? <span class='add'>(1)</span> If, monks, a monk is obsessed by addiction to sense-pleasures, to this extent is his mind obsessed. <span class='add'>(2)</span> If, monks, a monk is obsessed by malevolence, to this extent is his mind obsessed. <span class='add'>(3)</span> If, monks, a monk is obsessed by sloth and torpor, to this extent is his mind obsessed. <span class='add'>(4)</span> If, monks, a monk is obsessed by restlessness and worry, to this extent is his mind obsessed. <span class='add'>(5)</span> If, monks, a monk is obsessed by doubt, to this extent is his mind obsessed, to this extent is his mind obsessed. <span class='add'>(6)</span> If, monks, a monk centres his thought on this world, to this extent is his mind obsessed. <span class='add'>(7)</span> If, monks, a monk centres his thought on the world beyond, to this extent is his mind obsessed. <span class='add'>(8)</span> If, monks, a monk, disputatious, quarrelsome, contentious, lives wounding with the weapons of his tongue, to this extent is his mind obsessed. He comprehends thus: ‘I have no subjective obsession, not got rid of, owing to which I, if my mind were obsessed by it, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en386' href='#pts-vp-en386'>PTS vp En 386</a> could not know, could not see (things) as they really are; my thought is well directed towards awakening as to the truths.’ This is the first knowledge won by him, ariyan, transcendental, not in common with average men.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>And again, monks, the ariyan disciple reflects thus: ‘While I am following, developing, maturing this view, I gain calm for myself, I gain quenchedness for myself.’ He comprehends thus: ‘While I am following, developing, maturing this view, I gain calm for myself, I gain quenchedness for myself.’ This is the second knowledge won by him, ariyan, transcendental, not in common with average men.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>And again, monks, an ariyan disciple reflects thus: ‘Is there another recluse or brahman, outside here, who is possessed of a view such as I am possessed of?’ He comprehends thus: ‘There is no other recluse or brahman, outside here, who is possessed of a view such as I am possessed of.’ This is the third knowledge won by him, ariyan, transcendental, not in common with average men.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>And again, monks, the ariyan disciple reflects thus: ‘Am I too possessed of the kind of propriety a man is possessed of who is endowed with right view?’ And what kind of propriety, monks, is a man possessed of who is endowed with (right) view? This is propriety, monks, for a man endowed with (right) view: Whatever kind of offence he falls into he makes known the removal of such an offence, for he confesses it, discloses it, declares it quickly to the Teacher or to intelligent fellow Brahma-farers; having confessed, disclosed and declared it, he comes to restraint in the future.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>Just as an innocent little baby lying on its back quickly draws back its hand or foot if it has touched a live ember, even so, monks, this is propriety for a man endowed with (right) view: Whatever kind of offence he falls into he makes known the removal of such an offence, for he confesses it, discloses it, declares it quickly to the Teacher or to intelligent fellow Brahma-farers; having confessed, disclosed and declared it, he comes to restraint in the future. He comprehends thus: ‘I too am possessed of the kind of propriety which a man is possessed of who is endowed with (right) view.’ This is the fourth knowledge won by him, ariyan, transcendental, not in common with average men.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en387' href='#pts-vp-en387'>PTS vp En 387</a> And again, monks, the ariyan disciple reflects thus: ‘Am I too possessed of the kind of propriety a man is possessed of who is endowed with (right) view?’ And what kind of propriety, monks, is a man possessed of who is endowed with (right) view? This is propriety, monks, for a man endowed with (right) view: If he is zealous concerning those manifold things which are to be done for fellow Brahma-farers, he then becomes of strong aspiration for training in the higher moral habit, for training in the higher thought, for training in the higher intuitive wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>Just as a cow with a young calf, while she is pulling the grass keeps an eye on the calf, even so, monks, this is propriety for a man endowed with (right) view: If he is zealous concerning those manifold things which are to be done for fellow Brahma-farers, he then becomes of strong aspiration for training in the higher moral habit, for training in the higher thought, for training in the higher intuitive wisdom. He comprehends thus: ‘I too am possessed of the kind of propriety a man is possessed of who is endowed with (right) view.’ This is the fifth knowledge won by him, ariyan, transcendental, not in common with average men.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>And again, monks, the ariyan disciple reflects thus: ‘Am I too possessed of the kind of strength a man is possessed of who is endowed with (right) view?’ And what kind of strength, monks, is a man possessed of who is endowed with (right) view? This is strength, monks, for a man endowed with (right) view: While Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata are being taught, having applied himself, paying attention, concentrating with all the mind, he listens to Dhamma with ready ear. He comprehends thus: ‘I too am possessed of the kind of strength a man is possessed of who is endowed with (right) view.’ This is the sixth knowledge won by him, ariyan, transcendental, not in common with average men.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a>And again, monks, the ariyan disciple reflects thus: ‘Am I too possessed of the kind of strength a man is possessed of who is endowed with (right) view?’ And what kind of strength, monks, is a man possessed of who is endowed with (right) view? This is strength, monks, for a man endowed with (right) view: While Dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata are being taught, he acquires knowledge of the goal, he acquires knowledge of Dhamma, he acquires the rapture that is connected with <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en388' href='#pts-vp-en388'>PTS vp En 388</a> Dhamma. He comprehends thus: ‘I too am possessed of the kind of strength a man is possessed of who is endowed with (right) view.’ This monks, is the seventh knowledge won by him, ariyan, transcendental, not in common with average men.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>Thus, monks, propriety has come to be well sought by an ariyan disciple who is possessed of seven factors for realising the fruit of stream-attainment. Possessed of seven factors thus, monks, an ariyan disciple is possessed of the fruit of stream-attainment.”</p>
<p>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced m what the Lord had said.</p>
