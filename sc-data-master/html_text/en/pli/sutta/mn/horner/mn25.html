<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Revered One,” these monks answered the Lord in assent.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>“Monks, a sower does not sow a crop for herds of deer, thinking:</p>
<p>‘Let the herds of deer, enjoying this crop sown by me, flourish in good condition for many a long day.’</p>
<p>Monks, the sower sows the crop for herds of deer thinking:</p>
<p>‘The herds of deer will eat fodder encroaching entranced on this crop sown by me; encroaching entranced and eating the fodder, they will get elated;<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en195' href='#pts-vp-en195'>PTS vp En 195</a> being elated they will get careless; being careless they will become those to be done to as one wills amid this crop.’</p>
<h2><span class='add'>The First Herd of Deer</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Then, monks, the first herd of deer ate fodder encroaching entranced on this crop sown by the sower; encroaching entranced and eating the fodder these got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, this first herd of deer did not escape from the sower's mastery.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>The Second Herd of Deer</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then, monks, the second herd of deer realised:</p>
<p>‘The first herd of deer has eaten fodder encroaching entranced on that crop sown by the sower; these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thus this first herd of deer did not escape from the sower's mastery.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Suppose that we should all refrain from eating the crops; and refraining from enjoyment where there is fear, having plunged into a stretch of forest, should stay there?’</p>
<p>So all these refrained from eating the crops; and refraining from enjoyment where there was fear, having plunged into a stretch of forest, they stayed there.</p>
<p>In the last month of the hot weather the grass and water gave out, and their bodies became extremely emaciated so that their strength and energy diminished, and with diminished strength and energy they came back again to those crops sown by the sower; encroaching entranced they ate the fodder there; encroaching entranced and eating the fodder there, they got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless, they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, neither did the second herd of deer escape from the sower's mastery.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>The Third Herd of Deer</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>Then, monks, the third herd of deer realised:</p>
<p>‘The first herd of deer has eaten fodder encroaching entranced on that crop sown by the sower; these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thus this first herd of deer did not escape from the sower's mastery.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>Then that second herd of deer realised thus:</p>
<p>“The first herd of deer has eaten fodder encroaching entranced on that crop sown by the sower; these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thus this first herd of deer did not escape from the sower's mastery.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>Suppose that we should all refrain from eating the crops; and refraining from enjoyment where there is fear, having plunged into a stretch of forest, should stay there?”</p>
<p>So all these refrained from eating the crops; and refraining from enjoyment where there was fear, having plunged into a stretch of forest, stayed there.</p>
<p>In the last month of the hot weather the grass and water gave out, and their bodies became extremely emaciated so that their strength and energy diminished, and with diminished strength and energy they came back again to those crops sown by the sower; encroaching entranced they ate the fodder there; encroaching entranced and eating the fodder there, they got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless, they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>Suppose that we should make a lair near those crops sown by the sower, so that we can eat fodder not encroaching entranced on those crops sown by the sower; and then, having made the lair and not encroaching entranced on the crops sown by the sower, we will not get elated; not being elated we will not get careless; not being careless, we will not become those to be done to as the sower wills amid that crop.’</p>
<p>These made a lair near that crop sown by the sower; having made the lair, they ate fodder not encroaching entranced on the crops sown by the sower; these, eating fodder not encroaching entranced there, did not get elated; not being elated, they did not get careless; not being careless, they did not become those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>Thereupon, monks, it occurred to the sower and his companions:</p>
<p>‘This third herd of deer must be crafty and wily; this third herd of deer must have potency and be demons; they eat this crop that was sown, but we do not know of their comings or goings.</p>
<p>Suppose that we were to enclose this crop that was sown with large stakes and snares on all sides?</p>
<p>Then we might see the lair of the third herd of deer, where they might go to take it.’</p>
<p>So these enclosed that crop that was sown with large stakes and snares on all sides.</p>
<p>Then, monks, the sower and his companions saw the lair of the third herd of deer, where they went to take it.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, neither did this third herd of deer escape from the sower's mastery.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>The Fourth Herd of Deer</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>Thereupon, monks, the fourth herd of deer realised thus:</p>
<p>‘The first herd of deer has eaten fodder encroaching entranced on that crop sown by the sower; these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thus this first herd of deer did not escape from the sower's mastery.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>Then that second herd of deer realised thus:</p>
<p>“The first herd of deer has eaten fodder encroaching entranced on that crop sown by the sower; these, eating fodder encroaching entranced there got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thus this first herd of deer did not escape from the sower's mastery.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>Suppose that we should all refrain from eating the crops; and refraining from enjoyment where there is fear, having plunged into a stretch of forest, should stay there?”</p>
<p>So all these refrained from eating the crops; and refraining from enjoyment where there was fear, having plunged into a stretch of forest, they stayed there.</p>
<p>In the last month of the hot weather the grass and water gave out, and their bodies became extremely emaciated so that their strength and energy diminished, and with diminished strength and energy they came back again to those crops sown by the sower; encroaching entranced they ate the fodder there; encroaching entranced and eating the fodder there, they got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless, they became those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a>Suppose that we should make a lair near those crops sown by the sower, so that we can eat fodder not encroaching entranced on those crops sown by the sower; and then, having made the lair and not encroaching entranced on the crops sown by the sower, we will not get elated; not being elated we will not get careless; not being careless, we will not become those to be done to as the sower wills amid that crop.”</p>
<p>These made a lair near that crop sown by the sower; having made the lair, they ate fodder not encroaching entranced on the crops sown by the sower; these, eating fodder not encroaching entranced there, did not get elated; not being elated, they did not get careless; not being careless, they did not become those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thereupon, it occurred to the sower and his companions:</p>
<p>“This third herd of deer must be crafty and wily; this third herd of deer must have potency and be demons; they eat this crop that was sown, but we do not know of their comings or goings.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>Suppose that we were to enclose this crop that was sown with large stakes and snares on all sides?</p>
<p>Then we might see the lair of the third herd of deer, where they might go to take it.”</p>
<p>So these enclosed that crop that was sown with large stakes and snares on all sides.</p>
<p>Then the sower and his companions saw the lair of the third herd of deer, where they went to take it.</p>
<p>Thus neither did this third herd of deer escape from the sower's mastery.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd16' href='#dd16'>Dhdas-bh 16</a>Suppose that we were to make a lair somewhere where the sower and his companions do not come?</p>
<p>Having made our lair there, we might eat fodder not encroaching entranced on that crop sown by the sower; eating fodder not encroaching entranced, we will not get elated; not being elated, we will not get careless; not being careless, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en198' href='#pts-vp-en198'>PTS vp En 198</a> we will not become those to be done to as the sower wills amid that crop.’</p>
<p>These made a lair somewhere where the sower and his companions did not come; having made a lair there, they ate fodder not encroaching entranced on that crop sown by the sower; these eating fodder not encroaching entranced there, did not get elated; not being elated, they did not get careless; not being careless, they did not become those to be done to as the sower willed amid that crop.</p>
<p>Thereupon, monks, it occurred to the sower and his companions:</p>
<p>‘This fourth herd of deer must be crafty and wily; this fourth herd of deer must have potency and be demons; they eat this crop that was sown, but we do not know of their comings or goings.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd17' href='#dd17'>Dhdas-bh 17</a>Suppose that we were to enclose this crop that was sown with large stakes and snares on all sides?</p>
<p>Then we might see the lair of the fourth herd of deer, where they might go to take it.’</p>
<p>So these enclosed that crop that was sown with large stakes and snares on all sides.</p>
<p>But, monks, neither the sower nor his companions saw the lair of this fourth herd of deer, where they might go to take it.</p>
<p>Thereupon, monks, it occurred to the sower and his companions:</p>
<p>‘If we beat up this fourth herd of deer, these, beaten up, will beat up others; these, beaten up, will beat up others, and so all the deer will neglect this crop that was sown.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd18' href='#dd18'>Dhdas-bh 18</a>Suppose that we were not to interfere with the fourth herd of deer?’</p>
<p>So, monks, neither the sower nor his companions interfered with the fourth herd of deer.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, this fourth herd of deer escaped the sower's mastery.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd19' href='#dd19'>Dhdas-bh 19</a>Monks, this parable was made by me to illustrate the meaning.</p>
<p>And just this is the meaning here:</p>
<p>‘The crop,’ monks, this is a synonym for the five strands of sense-pleasures.</p>
<p>‘The sower,’ monks, this is a name for Māra the Evil One.</p>
<p>‘The sower's companions,’ monks, this is a synonym for Māra's companions.</p>
<p>‘The herds of deer,’ monks,</p>
<p>this is a synonym for recluses and brahmans.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>The First Kind of Recluse and Brahman</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd20' href='#dd20'>Dhdas-bh 20</a>Where, monks, the first kind of recluse and brahman ate fodder encroaching entranced on that crop sown by Māra—material things of the world—these, eating the fodder and encroaching entranced there, got elated; being elated, they got careless; being careless, they became those to be done to by Māra as he willed amid that crop—material things of the world.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, the first kind of recluses and brahmans did not escape from Māra's mastery.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en199' href='#pts-vp-en199'>PTS vp En 199</a> I, monks, say that this first kind of recluse and brahman is like that first herd of deer in the parable.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>The Second Kind of Recluse and Brahman</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd21' href='#dd21'>Dhdas-bh 21</a>Then, monks, the second kind of recluse and brahman realised:</p>
<p>‘That first kind of recluses and brahmans ate fodder encroaching entranced on a crop sown by Māra—material things of the world; these, eating the fodder and encroaching entranced there, got elated; being elated, they got careless; being careless, they became those to be done to by Māra as he willed amid that crop—material things of the world.’</p>
<p>Suppose that we should all refrain from eating the crop—material things of the world; and refraining from enjoyment where there is fear, having plunged into a stretch of forest, should stay there?’</p>
<p>All these refrained from eating the crop—material things of the world; refraining from enjoyment where there was fear, having plunged into a stretch of forest, they stayed there.</p>
<p>There these became those feeding on potherbs; they became those feeding on millet; they became those feeding on rice; they became those feeding on snippets of leather; they became those feeding on water-plants; they became those feeding on the red powder of rice husks; they became those feeding on the discarded scum of rice on the boil; they became those feeding on the flour of oil-seeds; they became those feeding on grass; they became those feeding on cowdung; they became those who subsisted on forest roots and fruits, eating the fruits that had fallen.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd22' href='#dd22'>Dhdas-bh 22</a>In the last month of the hot weather, when the grass and water dried up, their bodies became extremely emaciated; because their bodies were extremely emaciated their strength and energy diminished; because their strength and energy diminished, freedom of mind diminished; because freedom of mind diminished, they went back again to that very crop sown by Māra—material things of the world.</p>
<p>They ate fodder encroaching entranced there; eating fodder encroaching entranced there, they got elated; being elated they got careless; being careless, they became those to be done to by Māra as he willed amid that crop—those material things of the world.</p>
<p>Thus, monks, neither did this second kind of recluse and brahman escape from Māra's mastery.</p>

<p>Nevertheless they came to be of views like this: that the world is eternal, also that the world is not eternal; and that the world is an ending thing, also that the world is not an ending thing; and that the life principle and the body are the same, also that the life principle and the body are different; and that the Tathāgata becomes after dying, also that the Tathāgata does not become after dying, also that the Tathāgata both becomes and does not become after dying, also that the Tathāgata neither becomes nor does not become after dying.</p>
