<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Savatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. There the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Revered One,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>“Monks, by whatever monk five mental barrennesses are not got rid of, five mental bondages are not rooted out, that he should come to growth, expansion, maturity in this <i>Dhamma</i> and discipline, such a situation does not occur. Which are the five mental barrennesses that are not got rid of by him?</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a><span class='add'>(1)</span> Herein, monks, the monk has doubts about the Teacher, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure. Monks, whatever monk has doubts about the Teacher, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the first mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a><span class='add'>(2)</span> And again, monks, the monk has doubts about <i>Dhamma</i>, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the second mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a><span class='add'>(3)</span> And again, monks, the monk has doubts about the Order, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the third mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a><span class='add'>(4)</span> And again, monks, the monk has doubts about the training, is perplexed, is not convinced, is not sure, his mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving. This is the fourth mental barrenness that thus comes not to be got rid of by him whose mind does not incline to ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a><span class='add'>(5)</span> And again, monks, a monk comes to be angry, displeased with his fellow Brahma-farers, the mind worsened, barren. Monks, whatever monk comes to be angry, displeased with his fellow Brahma-farers, his mind worsened, barren, his mind does not incline to <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en133' href='#pts-vp-en133'>PTS vp En 133</a> ardour, to continual application, to perseverance, to striving.

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd28' href='#dd28'>Dhdas-bh 28</a>He cultivates the basis of psychic power that is possessed of concentration of intention with activities of striving; he cultivates the basis of psychic power that is possessed of concentration of energy with activities of striving; he cultivates the basis of psychic power that is possessed of concentration of consciousness with activities of striving; he cultivates the basis of psychic power that is possessed of concentration of investigation with activities of striving, with exertion as the fifth. Monks, if a monk is thus possessed of fifteen factors including exertion<a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.104' href='#pts-vp-pli1.104'>PTS vp Pali 1.104</a> he becomes one for successful breaking through, he becomes one for awakening, he becomes one for winning the incomparable security from the bonds.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd29' href='#dd29'>Dhdas-bh 29</a>Monks, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en136' href='#pts-vp-en136'>PTS vp En 136</a> it is as if there were eight or ten or a dozen hen's eggs properly sat on, properly incubated, properly hatched by that hen; such a wish as this would not arise in that hen: ‘O may my chicks, having pierced through the egg-shells with the point of the claw on their feet or with their beaks, break forth safely.’ for these chicks were ones who were able to break forth safely having pierced through the egg-shells with the point of the claw on their feet or with their beaks. Even so, monks, is it that a monk who is thus possessed of the fifteen factors including exertion becomes one for successful breaking through, he becomes one for awakening, he becomes one for winning the incomparable security from the bonds.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd30' href='#dd30'>Dhdas-bh 30</a>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
