<p>At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. While he was there the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.”</p>
<p>“Revered one,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>“Fare along, monks, possessed of moral habit, possessed of the Obligations, fare along controlled by the control of the Obligations, possessed of right conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults; undertaking them rightly, train yourselves in the rules of training.</p>

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I be one who receives the requisites of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines for the sick,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd17' href='#dd17'>Dhdas-bh 17</a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘May I recollect (my) manifold former habitations, that is to say, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many an eon of integration, many an eon of disintegration, many an eon of integration-disintegration; such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this, I came to be in another state where such a one was I by name, having such and such a clan, such and such a colour, so was I nourished, such and such pleasant and painful experiences were mine, so did the span of life end. Passing from this I arose here. Thus may I remember (my) divers former habitations in all their modes and detail,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd18' href='#dd18'>Dhdas-bh 18</a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘With the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men, may I behold beings as they pass hence or come to be, mean, excellent, fair, foul, in a good bourn, in a bad bourn, according to the consequences of their deeds; may I comprehend: Indeed these worthy beings were possessed of wrong conduct in body, speech and thought, they were scoffers at the ariyans, holding a wrong view, incurring deeds consequent on a wrong view, these, at the breaking up of the body after dying, have arisen in a sorrowful state, a bad bourn, the abyss, Niraya Hell. But these worthy beings who were possessed of good conduct in body, speech and thought, who were not scoffers at the ariyans, holding a right view, incurring deeds consequent on a right view, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en45' href='#pts-vp-en45'>PTS vp En 45</a> these at the breaking up of the body after dying have arisen in a good bourn, a heaven world. Thus, with the purified deva-vision surpassing that of men may I behold beings as they pass hence, as they arise, mean, excellent, fair, foul, in a good bourn, in a bad bourn, according to the consequences of their deeds,’ he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd19' href='#dd19'>Dhdas-bh 19</a>Monks, if a monk should wish: ‘By the destruction of the cankers, having realised by my own super-knowledge here and now the freedom of mind, and freedom through wisdom that are cankerless, entering thereon, may I abide therein,’ <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.36' href='#pts-vp-pli1.36'>PTS vp Pali 1.36</a>he should be one who fulfils the moral habits, who is intent on mental tranquillity within, whose meditation is uninterrupted, who is endowed with vision, a cultivator of empty places.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd20' href='#dd20'>Dhdas-bh 20</a>That of which I have spoken thus was spoken in relation to this: Fare along, monks, possessed of moral habit, possessed of the Obligations, fare along controlled by the control of the Obligations, possessed of right conduct and resort, seeing danger in the slightest faults; undertaking them rightly, train yourselves in the rules of training.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd21' href='#dd21'>Dhdas-bh 21</a>Thus spoke the Lord. Delighted, these monks rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
