<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span> At one time the Lord, walking on tour among the Kurus together with a large Order of monks arrived at the market <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en251' href='#pts-vp-en251'>PTS vp En 251</a> town of the Kurus called Thullakoṭṭhita. The brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard: “Indeed the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans, gone forth from the Sakyan family, walking on tour among the Kurus together with a large Order of monks has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita. A lovely report about the revered Gotama has gone forth thus: ‘This Lord is perfected, wholly Self-Awakened, endowed with (right) knowledge and conduct, well-farer, knower of the worlds, incomparable charioteer of men to be tamed, teacher of devas and men, the Awakened One, the Lord. He makes known this world with the devas, with Māra, with Brahma, creation with its recluses and brahmans, its devas and men, having realised them by his own super-knowledge. With the meaning and the spirit he teaches Dhamma that is lovely in the beginning, lovely in the middle, lovely at the ending; he proclaims the Brahma-faring wholly fulfilled, quite purified. It were good to see perfected ones like this.’"</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>Then the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita approached the Lord; having approached, some, having greeted the Lord, sat down at a respectful distance; some exchanged greetings with the Lord, and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way, sat down at a respectful distance; some, having saluted the Lord with joined palms, sat down at a respectful distance; some, having made known their names and clans in the Lord's presence, sat down at a respectful distance; some, becoming silent, sat down at a respectful distance. As the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita were sitting down at a respectful distance, the Lord gladdened, roused, incited and delighted them with a talk on Dhamma.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>Now at that time a young man of family named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of a leading family in that very Thullakoṭṭhita, was sitting down in this assembly. Then it occurred to Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family: “In so far as I understand Dhamma taught by the Lord, it is no easy matter for one living in a house to fare the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled, completely pure and polished like a conch-shell. Suppose that I, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, should go forth from home into homelessness?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Then the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita, gladdened, roused, incited and delighted by the Lord's talk on Dhamma, rejoicing <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en252' href='#pts-vp-en252'>PTS vp En 252</a> in what the Lord had said and giving thanks for it, rising from their seats and greeting the Lord, departed keeping their right sides towards him. And not long after the brahmans and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita had departed, Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance; sitting down at a respectful distance, he spoke thus to the Lord: “In so far as I, revered sir, understand Dhamma taught by the Lord, it is no easy matter for one living in a house to fare the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled, completely pure and polished like a conch-shell. I wish, revered sir, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, to go forth from home into homelessness. May I, revered sir, receive the going forth in the Lord's presence, may I receive ordination.” “But have you, Raṭṭhapāla, your parents' consent for going forth from home into homelessness?” “I have not, revered sir, the consent of my parents for going forth from home into homelessness.” “Raṭṭhapāla, Tathāgatas do not allow (one) to go forth without the consent of the parents.” “I, revered sir, will do whatever is necessary so that my parents will consent to my going forth from home into homelessness.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Then Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, having greeted the Lord keeping his right side towards him, rising from his seat approached his parents; having approached, he spoke thus to his parents: “Mother and father, in so far as I understand Dhamma taught by the Lord, it is no easy matter for one living in a home to fare the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled, completely pure, and polished like a conch-shell. I wish, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, to go forth from home into homelessness. Consent to my going forth from home into homelessness.” When this had been said, the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to him: “You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. We do not consent <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en253' href='#pts-vp-en253'>PTS vp En 253</a> that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die we should be desolate without you. How could we, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>And a second time Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to his parents: “Mother and father, in so far as I understand Dhamma taught by the Lord, it is no easy matter for one living in a home to fare the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled, completely pure, and polished like a conch-shell. I wish, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, to go forth from home into homelessness. Consent to my going forth from home into homelessness.” And a second time, when this had been said, the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to him: “You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. We do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die we should be desolate without you. How could we, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>And a third time Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to his parents: “Mother and father, in so far as I understand Dhamma taught by the Lord, it is no easy matter for one living in a home to fare the Brahma-faring completely fulfilled, completely pure, and polished like a conch-shell. I wish, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, to go forth from home into homelessness. Consent to my going forth from home into homelessness.” And a third time, when this had been said, the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to him: “You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. We do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die we should be desolate without you. How could we, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>Then Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, not receiving his parents' consent, lay down there on the bare ground and said: “Here will there be death for me or going forth.” Then the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to him: “You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Get up, dear Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking, amusing yourself you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. We do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die we should be desolate without you. How could we, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?” When this had been said, Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>And a second time the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to him: “You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Get up, dear Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking, amusing yourself you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. We do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die we should be desolate without you. How could we, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?” And a second time, when this had been said, Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>And a third time the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to him: “You, dear Raṭṭhapāla, are our only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Get up, dear Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking, amusing yourself you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. We do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die we should be desolate without you. How could we, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?” And a third time, when this had been said, Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>Then the parents of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, approached his friends; having approached, they spoke thus to them; “This Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, is lying down on the bare ground, dears, and saying: ‘Here will there be death for me or going forth.’ Come, dears, approach Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family; having approached, speak thus to him: ‘You, good Raṭṭhapāla, are your parents' only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, good Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Get up, good Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en254' href='#pts-vp-en254'>PTS vp En 254</a> amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. Your parents do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die your parents would be desolate without you. How can they, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?’"</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>Then the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, having answered his parents in assent, approached Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family; and having approached, they spoke thus to him: “You, good Raṭṭhapāla, are your parents' only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, good Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Get up, good Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. Your parents do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die your parents would be desolate without you. How can they, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?’” When this had been said, Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>And a second time the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to him: “You, good Raṭṭhapāla, are your parents' only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, good Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Get up, good Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. Your parents do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die your parents would be desolate without you. How can they, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?’” And a second time, Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a>And a third time did the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, speak thus to him: “You, good Raṭṭhapāla, are your parents' only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, good Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Get up, good Raṭṭhapāla, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing meritorious things. Your parents do not consent that you should go forth from home into homelessness. If you were to die your parents would be desolate without you. How can they, while you are living, consent to your going forth from home into homelessness?’” And a third time, Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, was silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>Then the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, approached his parents; and having approached, they spoke thus to them: “Mother and father, this Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, is lying on the bare pound there saying: ‘Here will there be death for me or going forth.’ If you do not consent that Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, should go forth from home into homelessness, he will die there. But if you consent to his going forth from home into homelessness, after he has gone forth you may see him again. If Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, does not enjoy the going forth from home into homelessness, what alternative will there be for him? He will come back here. Consent to the going forth from home into homelessness of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family.” “We consent, dears, to the going forth from home into homelessness of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family. But after he has gone forth, he must come and see us.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd16' href='#dd16'>Dhdas-bh 16</a>Then the friends of Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, approached him; and having approached, they spoke thus to him: “You, good Raṭṭhapāla, are your parents' only child, dear and beloved, you live in comfort and are well cared for; you, good Raṭṭhapāla, do not know anything of suffering. Get up, eat and drink and amuse yourself; eating, drinking and amusing yourself, you can enjoy diverting yourself with sense-pleasures and doing <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en255' href='#pts-vp-en255'>PTS vp En 255</a> meritorious things. Your parents have consented to your going forth from home into homelessness, but after you have gone forth you must see your parents.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd17' href='#dd17'>Dhdas-bh 17</a>Then Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, having got up and regained his strength, approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, spoke thus to the Lord: “I, revered sir, have my parents' consent for the going forth from home into homelessness. May the Lord let me go forth.” Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, received the going forth in the Lord's presence, he received ordination.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd18' href='#dd18'>Dhdas-bh 18</a>Not long after the venerable Raṭṭhapāla had been ordained, half a month after he had been ordained, the Lord, having stayed for as long as he found suitable in Thullakoṭṭhita, set out on tour for Sāvatthī; and in due course, walking on tour, he arrived at Sāvatthī. While he was there the Lord stayed near Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, dwelling alone, aloof, diligent, ardent, self-resolute, having soon realised here and now by his own super-knowledge that incomparable goal of the Brahma-faring for the sake of which young men of family rightly go forth from home into homelessness, entering on it, he abided in it. And he knew: “Destroyed is birth, brought to a close the Brahma-faring, done is what was to be done, there is no more of being such or so.” And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla was one of the perfected ones.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd19' href='#dd19'>Dhdas-bh 19</a>Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla spoke thus to the Lord: “I want, revered sir, to see my parents, if the Lord allows me.” Then the Lord with his mind carefully reflected on the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's reasoning of mind. When the Lord knew that it was impossible for the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, throwing off the training, to return to the secular life, then the Lord spoke thus to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla: “Do now, Raṭṭhapāla, that for which you think it is the right time.” Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, rising from his seat, having greeted the Lord keeping his right side towards him, having packed away his bedding, set out on tour for Thullakoṭṭhita taking his bowl and robe; and in due course, walking on tour, he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita. <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en256' href='#pts-vp-en256'>PTS vp En 256</a> While he was there, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla stayed near Thullakoṭṭhita in the deer-park of the Kuru king.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd20' href='#dd20'>Dhdas-bh 20</a>Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, dressing in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, entered Thullakoṭṭhita for almsfood; while he was walking on an uninterrupted round for almsfood, he approached his own parents' house. Now at that time the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father was having his hair combed in the middle hall which had a door. He saw the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, coming in the distance, and seeing him, he spoke thus: “Our only son, dear and beloved, has gone forth among these shaveling recluses.” And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, received neither alms nor a refusal at his own father's house; all he received was abuse.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd21' href='#dd21'>Dhdas-bh 21</a>Now at that time the woman slave of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations wanted to throw away the previous evening's barley-gruel. But the venerable Raṭṭhapāla spoke thus to her: “If that, sister, is to be thrown away, put it here in my bowl.” Then as the woman slave of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations was putting the previous evening's barley-gruel into his bowl she recognised his hands and feet and voice. So the woman slave of the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's relations approached his mother, and having approached, she spoke thus to her: “If it please you, madam, you should know that the young master Raṭṭhapāla is back.” “Now then, if you speak the truth, you are a freed woman.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd22' href='#dd22'>Dhdas-bh 22</a>Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's mother approached his father; and having approached, she spoke thus to his father: “If it please you, householder, you should know that Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, is indeed back.” Now at that time the venerable Raṭṭhapāla was eating the previous evening's barley-gruel in a room provided for the purpose. Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father approached him; having approached, he spoke thus to him: “Can it be, dear Raṭṭhapāla, <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en257' href='#pts-vp-en257'>PTS vp En 257</a> that you are eating last evening's barley-gruel? Surely, dear Raṭṭhapāla, you should come into your own home?” “Where, householder, is there a home for us who have gone forth from home into homelessness? We are houseless ones, householder. I did come to your home, householder; but I received neither alms there nor a refusal; all I received was abuse.” “Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla, we will go to the house.” “No, householder, I have done with eating for today.” “Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla, consent to a meal on the morrow.” The venerable Raṭṭhapāla consented by becoming silent.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd23' href='#dd23'>Dhdas-bh 23</a>And when the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father had understood that he had consented, he went up to his own dwelling; and having gone there, he had a great heap made of gold coins and gold, and having had them hidden with screens, he summoned the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's former wives, and said: “Come you, daughters-in-law, adorn yourselves with the adornments adorned with which you used to be dear to Raṭṭhapāla, the young man of family, and beloved by him.” And towards the end of that night the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father, having had sumptuous foods, solid and soft, prepared in his own dwelling, had the time announced to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying: “It is time, dear Raṭṭhapāla, the meal is ready.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd24' href='#dd24'>Dhdas-bh 24</a>Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla, having dressed in the morning, taking his bowl and robe, approached his own father's dwelling; having approached, he sat down on the seat made ready. And the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father, having had that heap of gold coins and gold uncovered, spoke thus to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla: “This, dear Raṭṭhapāla, is your mother's wealth, the other is your father's, the other your paternal grandfather's. It is possible, dear Raṭṭhapāla, both to enjoy riches and do meritorious things. Come you, dear Raṭṭhapāla, throwing off the training and returning to the secular life, enjoy riches and do meritorious things.” “If you, householder, would do my bidding, having loaded this heap of gold coins and gold into wagons, and then having had it brought down, you would have it dropped in the middle stream of the river Ganges. What is the reason for this? It is from that source, householder, that there will arise for you grief, sorrow, suffering, lamentation and despair.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd25' href='#dd25'>Dhdas-bh 25</a>Taking hold of his feet, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's former wives <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en258' href='#pts-vp-en258'>PTS vp En 258</a> then spoke thus to him: “How, young master, of what kind are those nymphs for whose sake you fare the Brahma-faring?” “We, sisters, do not fare the Brahma-faring for the sake of nymphs.” Saying, “The young master Raṭṭhapāla addresses us with the word ‘sisters,’” they fell down fainting just there.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd26' href='#dd26'>Dhdas-bh 26</a>Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla spoke thus to his father: “If you would give food, householder, give it; but do not annoy us.” “Eat, dear Raṭṭhapāla, the meal is ready.” Then the venerable Raṭṭhapāla's father with his own hand served and satisfied the venerable Raṭṭhapāla with sumptuous food, solid and soft. And when the venerable Raṭṭhapāla had eaten and had withdrawn his hand from the bowl, standing he spoke these verses:</p>

<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd34' href='#dd34'>Dhdas-bh 34</a>Then the Kuru king addressed a trapper, saying: “Clear a pleasure-ground, good trapper, in the deer-park; we will go to see the lovely ground.” “Yes, sire,” and when the trapper had answered the Kuru king in assent, he saw, while he was clearing the deer-park, the venerable Raṭṭhapāla sitting down for the day-sojourn at the root of a tree; on seeing him, he approached the Kuru king, and having approached, he spoke thus to him: “Sire, the deer-park is cleared; but there is the young man of family, Raṭṭhapāla, the son of a leading family near this very Thullakoṭṭhita, and whom yon have constantly praised, sitting at the root of a tree for the day-sojourn.” “Well then, good trapper, no more now today of the pleasure-ground, but we will now at once pay respects to the revered Raṭṭhapāla.” And when he had said: “Give away all the solid and soft food that has been prepared,” he had many lovely vehicles harnessed, and having mounted a lovely vehicle, he set forth from Thullakoṭṭhita in great royal pomp with the many lovely vehicles so as to see the venerable Raṭṭhapāla.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd35' href='#dd35'>Dhdas-bh 35</a>Having gone by vehicle for as far as the ground was passable, and having then descended from the vehicle, with his princely train he approached the venerable Raṭṭhapāla on foot; having approached, he exchanged greetings with the venerable Raṭṭhapāla; and having conversed in a friendly and courteous way, he stood at a respectful distance. As he was standing at a respectful distance, the Kuru king spoke thus to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla: “Let the revered Raṭṭhapāla sit down here on the elephant-rug.” <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en260' href='#pts-vp-en260'>PTS vp En 260</a> “No, sire; you sit down, I am sitting on a seat of my own.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd36' href='#dd36'>Dhdas-bh 36</a>The Kura king sat down on the prepared seat; while he was sitting down the Kuru king spoke thus to the venerable Raṭṭhapāla: “Good Raṭṭhapāla, there are these four kinds of loss followed by which some (men) here, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, go forth from home into homelessness. What are the four? Loss through old age, loss through illness, loss of wealth, loss of relations. And what, good Raṭṭhapāla, is loss through old age? As to this, good Raṭṭhapāla, someone is worn, old, full of years, has lived his span and is at the close of his life. He reflects thus: ‘I am now worn, old, full of years, I have lived my span and am at the close of my life, so it is not easy for me to acquire wealth not already acquired or to use to advantage the wealth already acquired. Suppose that I, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, should go forth from home into homelessness? So he, following <span class='note' hidden=''>Woodward here has “So he that is followed by this loss through old age…", but the idea is, as above that it is following these losses that some persons give up the world.</span> this loss through old age, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, goes forth from home into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd37' href='#dd37'>Dhdas-bh 37</a>Good Raṭṭhapāla, this is called loss through old age. But the revered Raṭṭhapāla is still young, endowed with the coal-black hair of radiant youth, in his early prime, and there is none of this loss through old age for the revered Raṭṭhapāla. What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from home into homelessness?</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd38' href='#dd38'>Dhdas-bh 38</a>And what, good Raṭṭhapāla, is loss through illness? As to this, good Raṭṭhapāla, someone is ill, in pain, grievously ill. He reflects thus: ‘I am now ill, in pain, grievously ill, so it is not easy for me to acquire wealth not already acquired or to use to advantage the wealth already acquired. Suppose that I, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, should go forth from home into homelessness? So he, following this loss through illness, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, goes forth from home into homelessness. Good Raṭṭhapāla, this is called loss through illness. But the revered Raṭṭhapāla is still free from illness, not ailing, possessed of a good digestion that is neither too cold nor too hot, and there is none of this loss through illness for the revered Raṭṭhapāla. What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from home into homelessness?</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd39' href='#dd39'>Dhdas-bh 39</a>And what, good Raṭṭhapāla, is loss of wealth? As to this, good <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en261' href='#pts-vp-en261'>PTS vp En 261</a> Raṭṭhapāla, someone is rich, of great possessions, very wealthy, but gradually these riches of his diminish. He reflects thus: ‘Formerly I was rich, of great possessions, very wealthy, but gradually these riches of mine have diminished, so it is not easy for me to acquire wealth not already acquired or to use to advantage the wealth already acquired. Suppose that I, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, should go forth from home into homelessness? So he, following this loss through wealth, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, goes forth from home into homelessness. Good Raṭṭhapāla, this is called loss of wealth. But the revered Raṭṭhapāla is the son of a leading family in this very Thullakoṭṭhita, and there is none of this loss of wealth for the revered Raṭṭhapāla. What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from home into homelessness?</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd40' href='#dd40'>Dhdas-bh 40</a>And what, good Raṭṭhapāla, is loss of relations? As to this, good Raṭṭhapāla, someone has many friends and acquaintances, kith and kin, but gradually these relations of his diminish. He reflects thus: ‘Formerly I had many friends and acquaintances, kith and kin, but gradually these relations of mine have diminished, so it is not easy for me to acquire wealth not already acquired or to use to advantage the wealth already acquired. Suppose that I, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, should go forth from home into homelessness? So he, following this loss through relations, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, goes forth from home into homelessness. Good Raṭṭhapāla, this is called loss of relations. But the revered Raṭṭhapāla has many friends and acquaintances, kith and kin, in this very Thullakoṭṭhita, and there is none of this loss of relations for the revered Raṭṭhapāla. What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from home into homelessness?</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd41' href='#dd41'>Dhdas-bh 41</a>These, good Raṭṭhapāla, are the four kinds of loss followed by which some (men) here, having cut off hair and beard, having donned saffron garments, go forth from home into homelessness. But there are none of these for the revered Raṭṭhapāla. What has the good Raṭṭhapāla known or seen or heard that he has gone forth from home into homelessness?”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd42' href='#dd42'>Dhdas-bh 42</a>“There are, sire, four expoundings of Dhamma expounded by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One; because I have known and seen and heard these I have gone forth from home into homelessness. What are the four? The first expounding of Dhamma expounded by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One is that: ‘The instable world is brought to an end.’ Because I have known and seen and heard this I have gone forth <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en262' href='#pts-vp-en262'>PTS vp En 262</a> from home into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd43' href='#dd43'>Dhdas-bh 43</a>The second expounding of Dhamma expounded by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One is that: ‘The world is no refuge, no guard.’ Because I have known and seen and heard this I have gone forth from home into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd44' href='#dd44'>Dhdas-bh 44</a>The third expounding of Dhamma expounded by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One is that: ‘The world is not one's own, one must go leaving everything.’ Because I have known and seen and heard this I have gone forth from home into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd45' href='#dd45'>Dhdas-bh 45</a>The fourth expounding of Dhamma expounded by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One is that: ‘The world lacks and is unsatisfied, a slave to craving.’ Because I have known and seen and heard this I have gone forth from home into homelessness.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd46' href='#dd46'>Dhdas-bh 46</a>These, sire, are the four expoundings of Dhamma expounded by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One; because I have known and seen and heard these I have gone forth from home into homelessness.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd47' href='#dd47'>Dhdas-bh 47</a>“The good Raṭṭhapāla says: ‘The instable world is brought to an end.’ But how is the meaning of this saying to be understood, good Raṭṭhapāla?” “What do you think about this, sire? Were you, at the age of twenty or twenty-five, expert in (handling) an elephant and a horse and a chariot and a bow and a sword, strong of leg and arm, able and proficient in warfare?” “I, good Raṭṭhapāla, at the age of twenty or twenty-five, was expert in (handling) an elephant and a horse and a chariot and a bow and a sword, I was strong of leg and arm, able and proficient in warfare; methinks I was sometimes inspired; I saw none equal to myself in strength.”</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd48' href='#dd48'>Dhdas-bh 48</a>“What do you think about this, sire? Are you still so strong in leg and arm, able and proficient in warfare?” “No, good Raṭṭhapāla, I am now worn, old, full of years, I have lived my span and am at the close of my life, round eighty years of age. Sometimes, good Raṭṭhapāla, when I want to take a step in one direction I step in another.” “It was in reference to this, sire, that the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, said: ‘The instable world <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en263' href='#pts-vp-en263'>PTS vp En 263</a> is brought to an end.’ Because I have known and seen and heard this I have gone forth from home into homelessness.” “It is wonderful, good Raṭṭhapāla, it is marvellous, good Raṭṭhapāla, that this was so well spoken by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, that: ‘The instable world is brought to an end.’ For, good Raṭṭhapāla, the instable world is brought to an end.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd49' href='#dd49'>Dhdas-bh 49</a>Now, good Raṭṭhapāla, in this royal family are squadrons of elephants and squadrons of horses and squadrons of chariots and squadrons of infantry which, if we were in distress, would defend us. The good Raṭṭhapāla says: ‘The world is no refuge, no guard.’ But how is the meaning of this saying to be understood, good Raṭṭhapāla?” “What do you think about this, sire? Have you any chronic illness?” “I have a chronic illness of wind, good Raṭṭhapāla. Sometimes friends and acquaintances, kith and kin stand round me, saying: ‘Now the Kuru king will pass away, now the Kuru king will pass away.’” “What do you think about this, sire? Would you be able to say to friends and acquaintances, kith and kin: ‘Let the good friends and acquaintances, kith and kin, ease my pain, let them all share this feeling so that I could experience a more buoyant feeling? Or do you have to experience that feeling alone?” “I, good Raṭṭhapāla, am not able to say to friends and acquaintances, kith and kin: ‘Let the good friends and acquaintances, kith and kin, ease my pain, let them all share this feeling so that I could experience a more buoyant feeling. So I have to experience that feeling alone.” “It was in reference to this, sire, that the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, said: ‘The world is no refuge, no guard.’ Because I have known and seen and heard this I have gone forth from home into homelessness.” “It is wonderful, good Raṭṭhapāla, it is marvellous, good Raṭṭhapāla, that this was so well spoken by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, that: ‘The world is no refuge, no guard.’ For, good Raṭṭhapāla, the world is no refuge, no guard.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd50' href='#dd50'>Dhdas-bh 50</a>Now, Raṭṭhapāla, in this royal family is an abundance of gold coins and gold, both in the ground and above it. The good <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en264' href='#pts-vp-en264'>PTS vp En 264</a> Raṭṭhapāla says: ‘The world is not one's own, one must go leaving everything.’ But how is the meaning of this saying to be understood, good Raṭṭhapāla?” “What do you think about this, sire? Although you at present divert yourself endowed with and possessed of the five strands of sense-pleasures, will you hereafter be able to say: ‘Even so am I diverting myself endowed with and possessed of these same five strands of sense-pleasures?’ Or will others come into this wealth while you go on according to kamma?” “Although I at present, dear Raṭṭhapāla, divert myself endowed with and possessed of the five strands of sense-pleasures, I will not hereafter be able to say: ‘Even so am I diverting myself endowed with and possessed of these same five strands of sense-pleasures.’ So others will come into this wealth while I go on according to kamma.” “It was in reference to this, sire, that the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, said: ‘The world is not one's own, one must go leaving everything.’ Because I have known and seen and heard this I have gone forth from home into homelessness.” “It is wonderful, good Raṭṭhapāla, it is marvellous, good Raṭṭhapāla, that this was so well spoken by the Lord who knows, who sees, perfected one, fully Self-Awakened One, that: ‘The world is not one's own, one must go leaving everything.’ For, good Raṭṭhapāla, the world is not one's own, one must go leaving everything.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd51' href='#dd51'>Dhdas-bh 51</a>Now, the good Raṭṭhapāla says: ‘The world lacks and is unsatisfied, a slave to craving.’ But how is the meaning of this saying to be understood, good Raṭṭhapāla?” “What do you think about this, sire? Is the Kuru you dwell in as master, prosperous?” “Yes, good Raṭṭhapāla, the Kuru I dwell in as master is prosperous.” “What do you think about this, sire? If a trustworthy, reliable man were to come to you here from the east and having approached you should say: ‘If it please you, sire, you should know that I am coming from the east, and have seen a great country there, rich, prosperous, thronged with people; there were many squadrons of elephants there, squadrons of horses, squadrons of chariots, squadrons of infantry; there is much ivory there, much gold both unwrought <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en265' href='#pts-vp-en265'>PTS vp En 265</a> and wrought, many women are there. And it is possible to conquer it with such and such a force. Conquer it, sire.’ What would you do?” “When I had conquered it, good Raṭṭhapāla, I should dwell in it as master.”</p>
