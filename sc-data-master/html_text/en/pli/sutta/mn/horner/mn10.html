<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd1' href='#dd1'>Dhdas-bh 1</a><a class='ref nya' id='nya1' href='#nya1'>Nya 1</a><span class='evam'>Thus have I heard:</span></p>
<p>At one time the Lord was staying among the Kuru people in the township of the Kurus called Kammāssadhamma. While he was there, the Lord addressed the monks, saying:</p>
<p>“Monks.” <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en71' href='#pts-vp-en71'>PTS vp En 71</a> </p>
<p>“Revered one,” these monks answered the Lord in assent. The Lord spoke thus:</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd2' href='#dd2'>Dhdas-bh 2</a>“There is this one way, monks, for the purification of beings, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.56' href='#pts-vp-pli1.56'>PTS vp Pali 1.56</a>for the overcoming of sorrows and griefs, for the going down of sufferings and miseries, for winning the right path, for realising Nibbāna, that is to say, the four applications of mindfulness. What are the four? Herein, monks, a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body, ardent, clearly conscious (of it), mindful (of it) so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world; he fares along contemplating the feelings in the feelings, ardent, clearly conscious (of them), mindful (of them) so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world; he fares along contemplating the mind in the mind, ardent, clearly conscious (of it), mindful (of it) so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world; he fares along contemplating the mental objects in the mental objects, ardent, dearly conscious (of them), mindful (of them) so as to control the covetousness and dejection in the world.</p>
<h2><span class='add'>Contemplating the Body in the Body</span></h2>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd3' href='#dd3'>Dhdas-bh 3</a>And how, monks, does a monk fare along contemplating the body in the body? Herein, monks, a monk who is forest-gone or gone to the root of a tree or gone to an empty place, sits down cross-legged, holding his back erect, arousing mindfulness in front of him.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd4' href='#dd4'>Dhdas-bh 4</a>Mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out.</p>
<p>Whether he is breathing in a long (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing in <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en72' href='#pts-vp-en72'>PTS vp En 72</a> a long (breath)’; or whether he is breathing out a long (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing out a long (breath)’; or whether he is breathing in a short (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing in a short (breath)’; or whether he is breathing out a short (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing out a short (breath).’</p>
<p>He trains himself, thinking: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body. He trains himself, thinking: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.’</p>
<p>He trains himself, thinking: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the activity of the body.’ He trains himself, thinking: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the activity of the body.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd5' href='#dd5'>Dhdas-bh 5</a>Monks, it is like a clever turner or turner's apprentice who, making a long (turn), comprehends, ‘I am making a long (turn)’; or when making a short (turn) comprehends, ‘I am making a short (turn).’ Even so, monks, does a monk who is breathing in a long (breath) comprehend, ‘I am breathing in a long (breath)’; or when breathing out a long (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing out a long (breath)’; or when breathing in a short (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing in a short (breath)’; or when breathing out a short (breath) he comprehends, ‘I am breathing out a short (breath).’</p>
<p>He trains himself with the thought: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body.’</p>
<p>He trains himself with the thought: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.’</p>
<p>He trains himself with the thought: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the activity of the body.’</p>
<p>He trains himself with the thought: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the activity of the body.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd6' href='#dd6'>Dhdas-bh 6</a>In this way, monks, he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally; or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating dissolution-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating origination-and-dissolution things in the body; or, thinking, ‘There is the body,’ his mindfulness is established precisely to the extent necessary just for knowledge, just for remembrance, and he fares along independently of and not grasping anything in the world. It is thus too, monks, that a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd7' href='#dd7'>Dhdas-bh 7</a>And again, monks, a monk, when he is walking, comprehends, ‘I am walking’; or when he is standing still, comprehends, ‘I am <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en73' href='#pts-vp-en73'>PTS vp En 73</a> standing still’; or when he is sitting down, <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.57' href='#pts-vp-pli1.57'>PTS vp Pali 1.57</a>comprehends, ‘I am sitting down’; or when he is lying down, comprehends, ‘I am lying down.’ So that however his body is disposed he comprehends that it is like that.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd8' href='#dd8'>Dhdas-bh 8</a>Thus he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally; or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating dissolution-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating origination-and-dissolution things in the body; or, thinking, ‘There is the body,’ his mindfulness is established precisely to the extent necessary just for knowledge, just for remembrance, and he fares along independently of and not grasping anything in the world. It is thus too, monks, that a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd9' href='#dd9'>Dhdas-bh 9</a>And again, monks, a monk, when he is setting out or returning is one, acting in a clearly conscious way; when he is looking in front or looking around is one, acting in a clearly conscious way; when he has bent in or stretched out (his arm) is one, acting in a clearly conscious way; when he is carrying his outer cloak, bowl and robe is one, acting in a clearly conscious way; when he is eating, drinking, chewing, tasting is one, acting in a clearly conscious way; when he is obeying the calls of nature is one, acting in a clearly conscious way; when he is walking, standing, sitting, asleep, awake, talking, silent, he is one acting in a clearly conscious way. Thus he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally; or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating dissolution-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating origination-and-dissolution things in the body; or, thinking, ‘There is the body,’ his mindfulness is established precisely to the extent necessary just for knowledge, just for remembrance, and he fares along independently of and not grasping anything in the world. It is thus too, monks, that a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd10' href='#dd10'>Dhdas-bh 10</a>And again, monks, a monk reflects on precisely this body itself, encased in skin and full of various impurities, from the soles of the feet up and from the crown of the head down, that: ‘There is connected with this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver,<a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en74' href='#pts-vp-en74'>PTS vp En 74</a> membranes, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, serum, saliva, mucus, synovic fluid, urine.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd11' href='#dd11'>Dhdas-bh 11</a>Monks, it is like a double-mouthed provision bag that is full of various kinds of grain such as hill-paddy, paddy, kidney beans, peas, sesamum, rice; and a keen-eyed man, pouring them out, were to reflect: ‘That's hill-paddy, that's paddy, that's kidney beans, that's peas, that's sesamum, that's rice.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd12' href='#dd12'>Dhdas-bh 12</a>Even so, monks, does a monk reflect on precisely this body itself, encased in skin and full of various impurities, from the soles of the feet up and from the crown of the head down, that: ‘There is connected with this body hair of the head, hair of the body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, serum, saliva, mucus, synovic fluid, urine.’ Thus he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally.; or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating dissolution-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating origination-and-dissolution things in the body; or, thinking, ‘There is the body,’ his mindfulness is established precisely to the extent necessary just for knowledge, just for remembrance, and he fares along independently of and not grasping anything in the world. It is thus too, monks, that a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd13' href='#dd13'>Dhdas-bh 13</a>And again, monks, a monk reflects on this body according to how it is placed or disposed in respect of the elements, thinking: ‘In this body there is the element of extension, the element of cohesion, the element of heat, the element of motion.’</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd14' href='#dd14'>Dhdas-bh 14</a><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli1.58' href='#pts-vp-pli1.58'>PTS vp Pali 1.58</a>Monks, even as a skilled cattle-butcher, or his apprentice, having slaughtered a cow, might sit displaying its carcass at the cross-roads, even so, monks, does a monk reflect on this body itself according to how it is placed or disposed in respect of the elements, thinking: ‘In this body there is the element of extension, the element of cohesion, the element of heat, the element of motion.’ Thus he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally; or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating dissolution-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating origination-and-dissolution things in the body; or, thinking, ‘There is the body,’ his mindfulness is established precisely to the extent necessary just for knowledge, just for remembrance, and he fares along independently of and not grasping anything in the world. It is thus too, monks, that a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd15' href='#dd15'>Dhdas-bh 15</a>And again, monks, as a monk might see a body thrown aside in a cemetery, dead for one day or for two days or for three days, swollen, discoloured, decomposing; he focuses on this body itself, thinking: ‘This body, too, is of a similar nature a similar constitution, it has not got past that (state of things).’ Thus he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally; or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating dissolution-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating origination-and-dissolution things in the body; or, thinking, ‘There is the body,’ his mindfulness is established precisely to the extent necessary just for knowledge, just for remembrance, and he fares along independently of and not grasping anything in the <a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en75' href='#pts-vp-en75'>PTS vp En 75</a> world. It is thus too, monks, that a monk fares along contemplating the body in the body.</p>
<p><a class='ref dd' id='dd16' href='#dd16'>Dhdas-bh 16</a>And again, monks, a monk might see a body thrown aside in a cemetery, and being devoured by crows or ravens or vultures or wild dogs or jackals or by various small creatures; he focuses on this body itself, thinking: ‘This body too is of a similar nature a similar constitution, it has not got past that (state of things).’ Thus he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body externally, or he fares along contemplating the body in the body internally and externally; or he fares along contemplating origination-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating dissolution-things in the body, or he fares along contemplating origination-and-dissolution things in the body; or, thinking, ‘There is the body,’ his mindfulness is established precisely to the extent necessary just for knowledge, just for remembrance, and he fares along independently of and not grasping anything in the world.
