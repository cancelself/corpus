<h2>The <a class='ref pts-p' id='pts-p65' href='#pts-p65'>PTS p 65</a> Four Jhānas connected with Formless Existence (<i>cattāri arūpajjhānāni</i>)</h2>
<h3>1. The Sphere of Unbounded Space (<i>ākāsānañcā-yatanaṃ</i>)</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs265' href='#pts-cs265'>PTS cs 265</a> <strong>Which are the states that are good?</strong></p>
<p>When, that he may attain to the Formless heavens, he cultivates the way [thereto], and so, by passing wholly beyond all consciousness of form, by the dying out of the consciousness of sensory reaction, by turning the attention <a class='ref pts-p' id='pts-p66' href='#pts-p66'>PTS p 66</a> from any consciousness of the manifold, he enters into and abides in that rapt meditation which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere of unbounded space—even the Fourth Jhāna, to gain which all sense of ease has been put away, and all sense of ill has been put away, and there has been a dying out of the gladness and sorrow he was wont to feel—(the rapt meditation) <a class='ref pts-p' id='pts-p67' href='#pts-p67'>PTS p 67</a> which is imbued with indifference, and where no ease is felt nor any ill, but only the perfect purity that comes of mindfulness and indifference—then the contact, etc. … <span class='pe'>[cf. <a href='#pts-cs165'>§ 165</a>]</span> the balance that arises, these … are states that are good.</p>
<h3>2. The Sphere of Infinite Consciousness (<i>viññāṇañcāyatanaṃ</i>)</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs266' href='#pts-cs266'>PTS cs 266</a> <strong>Which are the states that are good?</strong></p>
<p>When, that he may attain to the Formless heavens, he cultivates the way [thereto], and, having passed wholly beyond the sphere of boundless space, enters into and abides in that rapt meditation which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere of infinite consciousness—even the Fourth Jhāna, to gain which all sense of ease has been put away, etc.</p>
<p class='pe'>[Continue as in previous section.]</p>
<h3>3. The Sphere of Nothingness (<i>ākiñcaññāyatanaṃ</i>)</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs267' href='#pts-cs267'>PTS cs 267</a> <strong>Which are the states that are good?</strong></p>
<p>When, that he may attain to the Formless heavens, he cultivates the way thereto, and, having passed wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness, enters into and abides in that rapt meditation which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere of nothingness—even the Fourth <a class='ref pts-p' id='pts-p68' href='#pts-p68'>PTS p 68</a> Jhāna, to gain which all sense of ease has been put away, etc.</p>
<p class='pe'>[Continue as in <a href='#pts-cs265'>§ 265</a>.]</p>
<h3>4. The Sphere of neither Perception nor Non-perception (<i>neva-saññā-nāsaññāyatanaṃ</i>)</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs268' href='#pts-cs268'>PTS cs 268</a> <strong>Which are the states that are good?</strong></p>
<p>When, that he may attain to the Formless heavens, he cultivates the way thereto, and, having passed wholly beyond the sphere of nothingness, enters into and abides in that rapt meditation which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere where there is neither perception nor non-perception—even the Fourth Jhāna, to gain which all sense of ease must have been put away, etc.</p>
<p class='pe'>[Continue as in <a href='#pts-cs265'>§ 265</a>.]</p>
<p>The Four Jhānas connected with Formless Existence may be developed in sixteen combinations.</p>
