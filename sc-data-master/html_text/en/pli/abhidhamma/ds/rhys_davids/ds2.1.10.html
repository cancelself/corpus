<p>When an element of representative intellection which is inoperative has arisen, which is neither good nor bad nor the result of karma, which is accompanied by gladness, and which has as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste,  something tangible, or what not, then there is</p>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs570' href='#pts-cs570'>PTS cs 570</a> <strong>What on that occasion is self-collectedness?</strong></p>
<p>The stability, solidity, absorbed steadfastness of thought which on that occasion is the absence of distraction, balance, imperturbed mental procedure, quiet, the faculty and the power of concentration—this is the self-collectedness that there then is.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs571' href='#pts-cs571'>PTS cs 571</a> <strong>What on that occasion is the faculty of energy … <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs572' href='#pts-cs572'>PTS cs 572</a> of concentration?</strong></p>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs576' href='#pts-cs576'>PTS cs 576</a> <strong>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When an element of representative intellection which is inoperative has arisen that is neither good, nor bad, nor the result of karma—(1.) which is accompanied by gladness and associated with knowledge … (2.) which is accompanied by gladness, associated with knowledge, and is instigated … (3.) which is accompanied by gladness and disconnected with knowledge … (4.) which is accompanied by gladness, disconnected with knowledge, and is instigated … (5.) which is accompanied by indifference and associated with knowledge  … (6.) which is accompanied by indifference, associated with knowledge, and is instigated … (7.) which is accompanied by indifference and disconnected with knowledge … (8.) which is accompanied by indifference, disconnected with knowledge, and is instigated—and which has as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, something tangible, <a class='ref pts-p' id='pts-p151' href='#pts-p151'>PTS p 151</a> or what not—then there is contact … balance. Now these … are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs576a' href='#pts-cs576a'>PTS cs 576a</a> That disinterestedness, the root of the indeterminate … that absence of hate, the root of the indeterminate … that absence of dullness, the root of the indeterminate … these are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<h2>B. In connexion with the Universe of Form</h2>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs577' href='#pts-cs577'>PTS cs 577</a> <strong>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When he cultivates rapt meditation in connexion with the universe of Form, which is inoperative, is neither good, nor bad, nor the result of karma, and which is concerned with easeful living under present conditions—and so, aloof from sensuous desires, aloof from evil ideas, by earth-gazing, enters into and abides in the First Jhāna … then there is contact … balance. Now these … are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class='pe'><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs578' href='#pts-cs578'>PTS cs 578</a> Repeat in the case of each remaining Jhāna of the Fourfold, and of those of the Fivefold System.</p>
<h2>C. In connexion with the Universe of the Formless (<i>arūpā-vacara-kiriyā</i>)</h2>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs579' href='#pts-cs579'>PTS cs 579</a> <strong>Which are the states that are indeterminate?</strong></p>
<p>When he cultivates rapt meditation in connexion with the universe of the Formless, which is inoperative, is neither good, nor bad, nor the result of karma, and is concerned with <a class='ref pts-p' id='pts-p152' href='#pts-p152'>PTS p 152</a> easeful living under present conditions—and when, by passing wholly beyond all consciousness of form, by the dying out of the consciousness of sensory reaction, by turning the attention from any consciousness of the manifold, he enters into and abides in that rapt meditation which is accompanied by the consciousness of a sphere of unbounded space—even the Fourth Jhāna, to gain which all sense of ease has been put away, etc. … then there is contact  … balance. Now these … are states that are indeterminate.</p>
<p class='pe'><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs580' href='#pts-cs580'>PTS cs 580–582</a> Here follow, with the same opening formula as in the foregoing answer, the three remaining “Jhānas connected with Formless Existence”. See <a href='#pts-cs266'>§§ 266</a>–<a href='#pts-cs268'>268</a>.</p>
