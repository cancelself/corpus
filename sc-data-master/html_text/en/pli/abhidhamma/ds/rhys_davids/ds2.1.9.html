<p>When, as the result of bad karma having been wrought, having been stored up, visual cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness and having as its object a sight  … auditory cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness and having as its object a sound … olfactory cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness and having as its object a smell … gustatory cognition has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness and having as its object a taste … cognition of body has arisen, accompanied by distress and having as its object something tangible, then there is</p>

<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs558' href='#pts-cs558'>PTS cs 558</a> <strong>What on that occasion is feeling?</strong></p>
<p>The bodily pain, the bodily distress which, on that occasion, is born of contact with the appropriate element of cognition of body; the painful, distressful sensation which is born of contact with the body; the painful, distressful feeling which is born of contact with the body—this is the feeling that there then is.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs559' href='#pts-cs559'>PTS cs 559</a> <strong>What on that occasion is distress?</strong></p>

<p>When, as the result of bad karma having been wrought, having been stored up, an element of ideation has arisen, accompanied by disinterestedness, and having as its object a sight, a sound, a smell, a taste, something tangible or what not, then there is</p>
<ul>
<li>contact,</li>
<li>feeling,</li>
<li>perception,</li>
<li>volition,</li>

<p>When, as the result of bad karma having been wrought, having been stored up, an element of representative intellection has arisen, accompanied by indifference, and having as its object a sight, etc., or what not, then there is</p>
