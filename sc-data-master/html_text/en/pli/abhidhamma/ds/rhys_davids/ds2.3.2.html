<p class='pe'>Answers to these three questions as in former groups. See <a href='#pts-cs1226'>§§ 1226</a>–<a href='#pts-cs1228'>1228</a>, <a href='#pts-cs1771'>§§ 1771</a>–<a href='#pts-cs1173'>1173</a>, etc..</p>
<p>In the first edition kilesā was rendered as “Corruptions”. “Vices” is not etymologically a better fit, but, as a stock term for wrong ways or states, it comes nearer in usage to kilesa. These stand, in all but the earliest Pāli (kilesā is hard to find in Vinaya or Dhamma), for the lower, unregenerate side of the average man's nature.</p>
