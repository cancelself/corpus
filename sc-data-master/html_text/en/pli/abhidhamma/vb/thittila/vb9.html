<h2>1. Analysis According to the Discourses</h2>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs431' href='#pts-cs431'>PTS cs 431</a><a class='ref ba' id='ba282' href='#ba282'>BA 282</a><a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli216' href='#pts-vp-pli216'>PTS vp 216</a> The four bases of accomplishment—Herein a bhikkhu develops the basis of accomplishment furnished with “wish-concentration, striving-activity”; develops the basis of accomplishment furnished with “energy-concentration, striving-activity”; develops the basis of accomplishment furnished with “consciousness-concentration, striving-activity”; develops the basis of accomplishment furnished with “reason-concentration, striving-activity”.</p>
<h3>1. Wish as the Basis of Accomplishment</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs432' href='#pts-cs432'>PTS cs 432</a>And how does a bhikkhu develop the basis of accomplishment furnished with “wish-concentration, striving-activity”? If a bhikkhu, having made wish dominant, gains concentration; gains one-pointedness of consciousness. This is called “wish-concentration”. He engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the non-arising of evil bad states that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the abandoning of evil bad states that have arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the arising of good states that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the stabilizing, for the collocation, for the increase, for the maturity, for the development, for the completion of good states that have arisen. These are called “striving-activity”. Thus this “wish-concentration” and this “striving-activity”, these taken together collectively and briefly go by the name “wish-concentration, striving-activity”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs433' href='#pts-cs433'>PTS cs 433</a>Therein what is <span class='term'>wish</span>? That which is wish, act of wishing, desire to do, good righteous wish. This is called wish. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli217' href='#pts-vp-pli217'>PTS vp 217</a></p>
<p>Therein <a class='ref ba' id='ba283' href='#ba283'>BA 283</a>what is <span class='term'>concentration</span>? That which is stability, steadfastness, firmness of consciousness; non-distraction, non-wavering, mental imperturbability, calmness, controlling faculty of concentration, power of concentration, right concentration. This is called concentration.</p>
<p>Therein what is <span class='term'>“striving-activity”</span>? That which is the arousing of mental energy, toiling, endeavour, aspiring, effort, zeal, perseverance, vigour, stability, unfaltering endeavour, not relinquishing wish, not relinquishing the task, firm hold of the task, energy, controlling faculty of energy, power of energy, right effort. This is called “striving-activity”. Thus of this wish, of this concentration and of this “striving-activity” he is possessed, well possessed,  attained, well attained, endowed, well endowed, furnished. Therefore this is called “furnished with `wish-concentration, striving-activity”'.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs434' href='#pts-cs434'>PTS cs 434</a><span class='term'>“Accomplishment”</span> means: That which of these states is accomplishment, full accomplishment, act of accomplishing, act of accomplishing fully, gaining, gaining repeatedly, acquiring, acquiring well, contacting, realization, achievement.</p>
<p>“The <span class='term'>basis of accomplishment”</span> means: The aggregate of feeling, aggregate of perception, aggregate of mental concomitants, aggregate of consciousness of one (in whom the accomplishments have) come to be in the aforesaid manner.</p>
<span class='term'>“Develops the basis of accomplishment”</span> means: These states he pursues, develops, repeats. Therefore this is called “develops the basis of accomplishment”.
<h3>2. Energy as the Basis of Accomplishment</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs435' href='#pts-cs435'>PTS cs 435</a>And how does a bhikkhu develop the basis of accomplishment furnished with “energy-concentration, striving-activity”?

He engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the non-arising of evil bad states that have not arisen;* for the abandoning of evil bad states that have arisen;* for the arising of good states that have not arisen; engenders wish, makes effort, arouses energy, exerts the mind, strives for the stabilizing, for the collocation, for the increase, for <a class='ref ba' id='ba284' href='#ba284'>BA 284</a><span class='add'>|</span> the maturity, for the development, for the completion of good states that have arisen.

<h3>3. Consciousness as the Basis of Accomplishment</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs438' href='#pts-cs438'>PTS cs 438</a>And how does a bhikkhu develop the basis of accomplishment furnished with “consciousness-concentration, striving-activity”?
