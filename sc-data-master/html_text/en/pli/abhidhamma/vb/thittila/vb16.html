Herein the Tathāgata comprehends the inclination of beings; he comprehends the latent  tendency; he comprehends characteristic action; he comprehends disposition; he comprehends beings with little dust in their eyes, with much dust in their eyes, with sharp controlling faculties, with weak controlling faculties, of good qualities, of bad qualities, easy to instruct, hard to instruct, fit or not fit.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs815' href='#pts-cs815'>PTS cs 815</a>And what is the <span class='term'>inclination (of thought) of beings</span>? “The world is eternal” or “the world is not eternal”, “the world is finite” or “the world is infinite”, “vital principle and the body are the same” or “vital principle and the body are different”, “a being (text = tathāgata) exists after death” or “a being does not exist after death” or “a being exists and does not exist after death” or “a being neither exists nor does not exist after death”, thus there are beings depending on becoming views, depending on non-becoming views.

That which in the world is a lovely thing, pleasant thing, the tendency of beings to lust for that lies latent; that which in the world is an unlovely thing, unpleasant thing, the tendency of beings to repulsion for that lies latent. Thus in these two states it should be understood that ignorance continuously occurs, and coupled therewith, conceit, wrong view and doubt. This is latent tendency of beings.</p>

These are those beings who are not fit. <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli342' href='#pts-vp-pli342'>PTS vp 342</a></p>
