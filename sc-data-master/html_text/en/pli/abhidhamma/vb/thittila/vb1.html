<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1' href='#pts-cs1'>PTS cs 1</a><a class='ref ba' id='ba1' href='#ba1'>BA 1</a>The five aggregates are: The aggregate of material quality, aggregate of feeling, aggregate of perception, aggregate of mental concomitants, aggregate of consciousness.</p>
<h3>1. The Aggregate of Material Quality</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2' href='#pts-cs2'>PTS cs 2</a>Therein what is the <span class='term'>aggregate of material quality</span>? Whatever material quality is past, future or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, distant or proximate; (taking) these together collectively and briefly, this is called the aggregate of material quality.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3' href='#pts-cs3'>PTS cs 3</a>Therein what is <span class='term'>past material quality</span>? That material quality which is past, ceased, dissolved, changed, terminated, disappeared, or which having arisen has dissolved, has passed and is classed <a class='ref ba' id='ba2' href='#ba2'>BA 2</a><span class='add'>|</span> among the things that are past, (i.e.,) the four great essentials and the material qualities derived from the four great essentials. This is called past material quality.</p>
<p>Therein what is <span class='term'>future material quality</span>? That material quality which is not born, not become, not begotten, non-existent, fully non-existent, not apparent, not risen, not well risen, not uprisen, not well uprisen, which is future and is classed among the things that are future, (i.e.,) the four great essentials and the material qualities derived from the four great essentials.
