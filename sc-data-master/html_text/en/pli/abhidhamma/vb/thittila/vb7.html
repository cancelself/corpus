He dwells contemplating feeling in feelings internally; dwells contemplating feeling in feelings externally; dwells contemplating feeling in feelings both internally and externally, ardent, aware, mindful; removing covetousness and mental pain in the world. He dwells contemplating consciousness in consciousness internally; dwells contemplating consciousness in consciousness externally; dwells contemplating consciousness in consciousness both internally and externally, ardent, aware, mindful; removing covetousness and mental pain in the world. He dwells contemplating mental state in mental states internally; dwells contemplating mental state in mental states externally; dwells contemplating mental state in mental states both internally and externally, ardent, aware, mindful; removing covetousness and mental pain in the world.</p>
<h3>1. Exposition of Contemplation on the Body</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs356' href='#pts-cs356'>PTS cs 356</a>And how does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating body in the body internally? Herein a bhikkhu reflects on the body internally, upward from the soles of the feet, downward from the tips of the hair, enclosed in skin, full of divers impurities, thus, “There is in this body head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, sinews, bone, bone marrow, kidneys; heart, liver, membraneous tissue, spleen, lungs; intestines, mesentery, undigested food, excrement; bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat; tears, lymph, saliva, nasal mucus, <a class='ref ba' id='ba252' href='#ba252'>BA 252</a><span class='add'>|</span> synovial fluid, urine”. He pursues, develops, repeats, fixes that object well; having pursued, having developed, having repeated, having fixed that object well, he applies (his) consciousness externally on the body (of others). <a class='ref pts-vp-pli' id='pts-vp-pli194' href='#pts-vp-pli194'>PTS vp 194</a></p>
<p>And how does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating body in the body externally? Herein a bhikkhu reflects on the body externally, upward from the soles of the feet, downward from the tips of the hair, enclosed in skin, full of divers impurities, thus, “There is in that one's body head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, sinews, bone, bone marrow, kidneys; heart, liver, membraneous tissue, spleen, lungs; intestines, mesentery, undigested food, excrement; bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat; tears, lymph, saliva, nasal mucus, synovial fluid, urine”. He pursues, develops, repeats, fixes that object well; having pursued, having developed, having repeated, having fixed that object well, he applies (his) consciousness both internally and externally on the body.</p>
<p>And how does a bhikkhu dwell contemplating body in the body both internally and externally?
