Knowledge of consequence is analytic insight of consequence; knowledge of origin is analytic  insight of origin; knowledge of the actual philological definition of these (i.e., 1 & 2) is analytic insight of philology; knowledge of (these) knowledges is analytic insight of knowledge. This is summary section.</p>

Knowledge of suffering is analytic insight of consequence; knowledge of the cause of suffering is analytic insight of origin; knowledge of the cessation of suffering is analytic insight of consequence; knowledge of the way leading to the cessation of suffering is analytic insight of origin; knowledge of the actual philological definition of these is analytic insight of philology; knowledge of (these) knowledges is analytic insight of knowledge.

<h3>6. Doctrine Section</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs724' href='#pts-cs724'>PTS cs 724</a>The four analytic insights are: The analytic insight of consequence, analytic insight of origin, analytic insight of philology, analytic insight of knowledge. </p>
<p>Therein what is <span class='term'>analytic insight of origin</span>? Herein a bhikkhu knows the Teaching; discourses in prose; discourses in prose and verse; expositions; verses; verses of joyous utterance; (quotations beginning) “thus it was said …”; birth stories; statements dealing with unique occurrences; miscellanies. This is called analytic insight of origin. He knows the meaning of this and that that is said thus, “this is the meaning of this that is said; this is the meaning of that that is said”. This is called analytic insight of consequence. Knowledge of the actual philological definition of these is analytic insight of philology; knowledge of (these) knowledges is analytic insight of knowledge. This is doctrine section.</p>
