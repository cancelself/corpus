<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs173' href='#pts-cs173'>PTS cs 173</a>Therein what is the <span class='term'>element of extension</span>? The element of extension is twofold: (It) Is internal; (it) is external. Therein what is internal element of extension? That which is personal, self-referable, hard, harsh, hardness, being hard, internal, grasped (by craving and false view). For example: head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin; flesh, sinews, bone, bone-marrow, kidneys; heart, liver, membraneous tissue, spleen, lungs; intestines, mesentery, undigested food, excrement; or whatever else there is, personal, self-referable, hard, harsh, hardness, being hard, internal, grasped. This is called internal element of extension.</p>
<p>Therein what is external element of extension? That which is external, hard, harsh, hardness, being hard, external, not grasped.
