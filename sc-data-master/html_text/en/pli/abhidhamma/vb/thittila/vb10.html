Herein a bhikkhu is mindful, furnished with excellent mindfulness-penetration, he remembers, remembers constantly, what has long been done and long been said (concerning release). This is called mindfulness-enlightenment-factor. (1)</p>
<p>He, dwelling mindful in the above manner, searches, investigates and reasons out thoroughly that same thing with wisdom. This is called truth investigation-enlightenment-factor. (2)</p>
<p>The energy of his searching, investigating and reasoning out thoroughly that same thing with wisdom, is strenuous, unshrinking. This is called energy-enlightenment-factor. (3)</p>
<p>For him of strenuous energy there arises zest that is not worldly. This is called zest-enlightenment-factor. (4)</p>
<p>For him of zestful mind the body (of mental aggregates) becomes calm, also consciousness becomes calm. This is called calmness-enlightenment-factor. (5)</p>
<p>For him of calm body (of mental aggregates) and mental pleasure, consciousness is concentrated. This is called concentration-enlightenment-factor. (6)</p>
<p>He, having consciousness concentrated in the above manner, is well balanced. This is called equanimity-enlightenment-factor. (7)</p>
