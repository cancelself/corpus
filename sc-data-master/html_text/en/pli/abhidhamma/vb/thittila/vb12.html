Abandoning illwill and antipathy he dwells having consciousness without illwill, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings; he cleanses his consciousness of illwill <a class='ref ba' id='ba320' href='#ba320'>BA 320</a><span class='add'>|</span> and antipathy.

Abandoning doubt, doubt overcome, he dwells without uncertainty as to good states; he cleanses his consciousness of doubt. Abandoning these five hindrances (that are) mental corruptions and attenuation of wisdom, he, aloof from sense pleasures, aloof from bad states, attains and dwells in the first jhāna accompanied by initial application, accompanied by sustained application, with zest and pleasure born of detachment; inhibiting initial application and sustained application he attains and dwells  in the second jhāna with internal refinement, exalted development of mind, without initial application, without sustained application, with zest and pleasure born of concentration; he, desireless of zest, dwells equable, mindful, aware, and he experiences pleasure by way of the body (of mental aggregates); this the Noble Ones declare, “The equable, mindful dweller in pleasure”; he attains and dwells in the third jhāna; by the abandoning of pleasure and by the abandoning of pain, then first terminating mental pleasure and mental pain he attains and dwells in the fourth jhāna (which is) neither-pain-nor-pleasure (but is) purity of mindfulness caused by equanimity; having wholly passed the perceptions of form by terminating perceptions of (sense) impingement, by not attending to diversity of perceptions, (concentrating) thus, “Infinite is space”, he attains and dwells in the state of infinity of space; having wholly passed the state of infinity of space, (concentrating) thus, “Infinite is consciousness”, he attains and dwells in the state of infinity of consciousness; having wholly passed the state of infinity of consciousness, (concentrating) thus, “There is nothing whatever”, he attains and dwells in the state of nothingness; having wholly passed the state of nothingness he attains and dwells in the state of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>
