<h1>16.5 Of Matter as a Moral Condition (<i>hetu</i>)</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc307' href='#pc307'></a>: That material qualities are moral conditions.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.5.1' href='#pts-cs16.5.1'>PTS cs 16.5.1</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Your view implies that (i.) material qualities must act as one or other of the six motives of moral or immoral conduct; (ii.) they have a mental object or idea, having the properties of mental adverting, adjustment, etc. From both of these implications you dissent, hence you cannot maintain your position.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.5.2-3' href='#pts-cs16.5.2-3'>PTS cs 16.5.2–3</a>Indeed, you are ready to maintain the contrary of (ii.), that proposition being quite true when applied to the six moral conditions, but untrue of material qualities.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.5.4' href='#pts-cs16.5.4'>PTS cs 16.5.4</a>But are not the four primary qualities conditions of the secondary material qualities that are derived from them? Of course you assent. Hence, the four being material, material qualities <em>are</em> conditions <span class='add'>however you understand “conditions”.</span></p>
