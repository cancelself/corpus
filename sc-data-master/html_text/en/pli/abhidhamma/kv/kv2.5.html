<h1>2.5 Of Articulate Utterance <span class='add'>During Ecstasy</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc120' href='#pc120'></a>: That there is articulate utterance on the part of one who has entered into <i>Jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.1' href='#pts-cs2.5.1'>PTS cs 2.5.1</a>You affirm this <span class='add'>in general</span>. Your statement should hold good for such an one everywhere, always, for all such persons, and for all such attainments in ecstatic meditation. But you do not admit all such cases. Then you cannot affirm it at all.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.2' href='#pts-cs2.5.2'>PTS cs 2.5.2</a>Does such an one make utterance by bodily movements? You deny that he does so, but why not, if your thesis is true? If he make no bodily expression, you should not affirm that he makes vocal expression.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.3' href='#pts-cs2.5.3'>PTS cs 2.5.3</a>If one during <i>Jhāna</i> having <span class='add'>the power of</span> speech, gives vocal expression, it follows that, having a body, he may also make bodily expression.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.4' href='#pts-cs2.5.4'>PTS cs 2.5.4</a>You affirm that, knowing the fact of Ill, he utters the word “Sorrow”, yet you deny that, knowing the fact of Cause <span class='add'>of Ill</span>, he utters the word “Cause”. But why? Why, again, deny that he, knowing the facts of “Cessation” <span class='add'>of Ill</span>, and “Path” <span class='add'>leading to that Cessation</span>, utters those words?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.5' href='#pts-cs2.5.5'>PTS cs 2.5.5</a>Or, taken negatively, why deny that he utters any of the last three terms, yet not deny that he utters the first?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.6' href='#pts-cs2.5.6'>PTS cs 2.5.6</a>You say that the object of such an one's insight is the <span class='add'>Ariyan</span> truth. But you deny that the object of <a class='pc' id='pc121' href='#pc121'></a> such an one's ear is truth. This, you say, is sound. But you deny that the object of his insight is sound.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.7' href='#pts-cs2.5.7'>PTS cs 2.5.7</a>No, you say, the truth is the object of his insight, sound the object of his ear. But if his insight has the truth as its object, and his ear has sound as its object, then, good sir, you should not affirm that such an one makes articulate utterance.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.7a' href='#pts-cs2.5.7a'>PTS cs 2.5.7a</a>If you say, that while his insight is concerned with the <span class='add'>first</span> truth and his ear with the sound, the attainer makes articulate utterance, you must admit a combination of two contacts, two feelings, two perceptions, two volitions, two consciousnesses <span class='add'>at a given moment</span>, (which is absurd).</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.8' href='#pts-cs2.5.8'>PTS cs 2.5.8</a>You affirm your thesis, yet you deny that it applies to one who has attained <i>Jhāna</i> by any one of the eight artifices, to wit, earth, water, fire, or air; blue-green, yellow, red, or white colour, or by <span class='add'>any of the four immaterial conceptual inductions, to wit,</span> infinity of space or of consciousness, “nothingness”, or “neither perception nor non-perception”. How is this intelligible? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.9' href='#pts-cs2.5.9'>PTS cs 2.5.9</a> If you deny each of these possibilities, you cannot affirm your proposition.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.10' href='#pts-cs2.5.10'>PTS cs 2.5.10</a>You deny, further, that one who practises <i>Jhāna</i> for merely mundane objects makes articulate expression, whether he attain any of the four stages. Neither then can you affirm your proposition. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.11' href='#pts-cs2.5.11'>PTS cs 2.5.11</a> If you deny the former, you must deny the latter.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.12' href='#pts-cs2.5.12'>PTS cs 2.5.12</a>You affirm your proposition only of one attaining the first supramundane <i>Jhāna</i>, not the second, third, or fourth. But if you affirm it of the first stage, what is there to make you deny it of the other three stages?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.14' href='#pts-cs2.5.14'>PTS cs 2.5.14</a>Is it wrong to say that there is articulate utterance on the part of one who has entered <i>Jhāna</i>?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One that initial <a class='pc' id='pc122' href='#pc122'></a> and sustained application of mind was vocal activity? And does not such application belong to one in first <i>Jhāna</i>? Surely then my proposition is true.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.15' href='#pts-cs2.5.15'>PTS cs 2.5.15</a>Granting that you quote correctly, and that one in first <i>Jhāna</i> is engaged in such application, I say, you have just denied that anyone attaining <i>Jhāna</i> by any of the eight artifices does make articulate utterance. How then can you also affirm your proposition?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.16' href='#pts-cs2.5.16'>PTS cs 2.5.16</a><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One that speech arises from initial application <span class='add'>or directing</span> of thought? And does not such movement of thought belong to one in first <i>Jhāna</i>?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.17' href='#pts-cs2.5.17'>PTS cs 2.5.17</a>That is no good reason. The Exalted One also said that speech is caused by perception. Now one in second, third, or fourth <i>Jhāna</i> has perception, but <span class='add'>we know that</span> he no longer applies or sustains thought. So also for the four more abstract <i>Jhāna</i> states (see <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs2.5.8'>PTS CS 2.5.8</a>).</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.18' href='#pts-cs2.5.18'>PTS cs 2.5.18</a>Moreover, is it not said in the Suttanta:</p>
<p>“In one who has entered first <i>Jhāna</i> speech has ceased”?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.19' href='#pts-cs2.5.19'>PTS cs 2.5.19</a>If you maintain your proposition in the teeth of this one, you must cease to hold <span class='add'>in accordance with the next words</span> in the Suttanta: that</p>
<p>“in one who has entered second <i>Jhāna</i>, thought initial and sustained has ceased”.</p>
<p>Similarly you must contradict the remaining words:</p>
<p>“in one who has entered third <i>Jhāna</i>, zest has ceased; in one who has induced fourth <i>Jhāna</i>, respiration has ceased; in one who has induced ecstasy of infinite space, perception of bodily qualities has ceased; in one who has induced ecstasy of infinite consciousness, perception of space infinity has ceased;<a class='pc' id='pc123' href='#pc123'></a> in one who has induced ecstasy of nothingness, perception of infinity of consciousness, has ceased; in one who has induced ecstasy wherein is neither perception nor non-perception, perception of nothingness has ceased; in one who has induced trance, both perception and feeling have ceased”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.20' href='#pts-cs2.5.20'>PTS cs 2.5.20</a>But if my proposition is wrong, why did the Exalted One say that</p>
<p>“for first <i>Jhāna</i> sound is obnoxious”?</p>
<p>Does not this show that one who has attained <i>Jhāna</i> can emit speech?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.21' href='#pts-cs2.5.21'>PTS cs 2.5.21</a>You accept both the Suttanta dictum and your proposition. But, by the same Sutta, that which is eliminated successively, as each further stage of <i>Jhāna</i> is reached, was pronounced to be obnoxious in its turn. Does that therefore indicate that one who attained each stage, practised each obstacle to that stage?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.5.22' href='#pts-cs2.5.22'>PTS cs 2.5.22</a>But did not the Exalted One say in the Suttanta:</p>
<p>“O Ānanda, Abhibhu, disciple of Sikhin, the Exalted One, Arahant Buddha Supreme, standing in the Brahma-world, lifted up his voice over ten thousand worlds, saying:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Arise and strive! go forth and give<br>
Yourselves unto the Buddha's Rule!<br>
Sweep ye away the hosts of Death<br>
As elephant a rush-built shed.<br>
Who in this Norm and Discipline<br>
Earnest and zealous shall abide,<br>
Casting away the round of births,<br>
He shall make utter end of Ill”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surely then an attainer does utter articulate sounds during ecstasy.</p>
