<h1>17.5 Of “save only the Ariyan Path”</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That save only the Ariyan Path, all other conditioned things may be called “Ill”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.5.1' href='#pts-cs17.5.1'>PTS cs 17.5.1</a>Then you call the Cause of Ill also Ill? If you deny, you cannot maintain your proposition. If you assent, do you mean that there are but three Truths? If you deny, your proposition falls. If you assent, do you not contradict the words of the Exalted One, that the Truths are four—Ill, Cause of Ill, Cessation of Ill, Way going to the Cessation of Ill?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.5.2' href='#pts-cs17.5.2'>PTS cs 17.5.2</a>If now you admit that the Cause of Ill is also Ill, in what sense do you judge it to be so?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Hetuvādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc318' href='#pc318'></a>In the sense of impermanence.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But the Ariyan Path, is that impermanent?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Hetuvādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Then is not that also Ill? … .</p>
<p>You say then that the Path is impermanent but not Ill, while the Cause of Ill is both impermanent and Ill. <span class='add'>It is impossible for you to maintain such a position</span>… .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Hetuvādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.5.3' href='#pts-cs17.5.3'>PTS cs 17.5.3</a>But if the Path be “a way going to the cessation of Ill”, I maintain that, when we speak of all other conditioned things as Ill, this Ariyan Path is excepted.</p>
