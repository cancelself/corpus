<h1>8.3 Of the Pleasures of Sense</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc214' href='#pc214'></a>: That the kāma-sphere means only the fivefold pleasures of sense.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.3.1' href='#pts-cs8.3.1'>PTS cs 8.3.1</a>You admit, do you not, that desire, intention, zest, and joy, and the passion or lust that is involved in each, are all bound up with the fivefold pleasures of sense? How then can you maintain that the kāma-life is only those pleasures?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.3.2' href='#pts-cs8.3.2'>PTS cs 8.3.2</a>Do you mean that human organs of sense are not co-extensive with kāma-life, the five organs of external sense and the co-ordinating sense, or mind? No, you say (meaning only the pleasures of sense in your proposition); but think again as to mind … Yes, you now say, mind is not kāma-life But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><span class='add'>Fivefold</span> <a class='pc' id='pc215' href='#pc215'></a> the world's sense-pleasures be,<br>
And mind as sixth, our lore doth rede.<br>
Whoso therein doth purge desire,<br>
Is thus from ill and sorrow freed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence it cannot be said that the Kāma-life does not include the mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.3.3' href='#pts-cs8.3.3'>PTS cs 8.3.3</a>Again, can you say that the pleasures of sense amount to a sphere of life, a destiny, a realm of beings, to renewed life, to a matrix, a station for consciousness, an acquiring of individuality? Is there <i>karma</i> leading to them? Are there beings to be reborn in them? Do beings get born, grow old, die, decease, get reborn “in” sense-pleasures? Are there the five aggregates in them? Are they a five-mode existence? Are Buddhas Supreme, Silent Buddhas, Chief Pairs of disciples reborn in them? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.3.4' href='#pts-cs8.3.4'>PTS cs 8.3.4</a> All these things you can predicate of the “kāma-element”, but not one of them of the pleasures of sense.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.3.5' href='#pts-cs8.3.5'>PTS cs 8.3.5</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, there are these fivefold <i>kāma</i>-pleasures—which are they? Objects desirable, sweet, agreeable, dear, connected with “<i>kāma</i>”, and seductive, are cognizable by sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch—these are the five kinds of <i>kāma</i>-pleasures”?</p>
<p>Hence surely the <i>kāma</i>-element is only those five.</p>
