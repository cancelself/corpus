<h1>6.3 Of the Four Truths</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the Four Truths are unconditioned.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.3.1' href='#pts-cs6.3.1'>PTS cs 6.3.1</a>Do you then also admit <span class='add'>not one, but</span> four <i>Nibbānas</i>? For if you do, is there among these four a boundary, division, line or interstice, different degrees as to loftiness, excellence or sublimity? … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.3.2' href='#pts-cs6.3.2'>PTS cs 6.3.2</a>You affirm, do you not, that each Truth is unconditioned. Take the first Truth on <span class='add'>the fact and nature of</span> Ill: is Ill itself unconditioned? You deny—that is, you mean that bodily ill, mental ill, grief, lamentation, melancholy or despair is conditioned? Or the second Truth on the cause of Ill—is that cause unconditioned? You deny … Then you must equally deny that desires of sense, desire for <span class='add'>after-</span> life, or desire to end life, is unconditioned? Or the fourth Truth of the Path to Cessation of <a class='pc' id='pc189' href='#pc189'></a> Ill—is the Path itself unconditioned? You deny … Then you do not mean that right views, right intentions … right concentration are unconditioned?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.3.3' href='#pts-cs6.3.3'>PTS cs 6.3.3</a>You admit then that Ill, its Cause, the Path are conditioned, and all the factors of those facts are conditioned, but deny that the <span class='add'>abstract</span> statement of each fact as a “Truth” is conditioned—which cannot be … .</p>
<p>Take<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.3.4' href='#pts-cs6.3.4'>PTS cs 6.3.4</a> now the Third Truth on the Cessation of Ill—is Cessation unconditioned? “Yes”, you say? Why then, if the First Truth is unconditioned, is not Ill unconditioned? Or the Cause? Or the Path? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.3.5' href='#pts-cs6.3.5'>PTS cs 6.3.5</a> In all but the Third Truth, you maintain that the true thing is conditioned—why not in the Third?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliyas:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.3.6' href='#pts-cs6.3.6'>PTS cs 6.3.6</a>But if I am wrong, why was it said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“These four things, <i>bhikkhus</i>, are stable, constant, immutable. Which are the four? `This is Ill!'—this, <i>bhikkhus</i>, is stable, constant, immutable. `This is the cause of Ill … the Cessation of Ill … the course leading to the Cessation of Ill!'—this, <i>bhikkhus</i>, is stable, constant, immutable. These are the four”?</p>
<p>Surely then the Four Truths are unconditioned.</p>
