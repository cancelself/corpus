<h1>12.8 Of Murder</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That a person who has attained to sound views may yet designedly commit murder.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12.8.1' href='#pts-cs12.8.1'>PTS cs 12.8.1</a>Then you imply that he may designedly commit <span class='add'>any murder, even the worst, to wit</span> matricide, parricide, Arahanticide, or with enmity at heart may wound a Tathāgata, or create schism in the Order … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12.8.2' href='#pts-cs12.8.2'>PTS cs 12.8.2</a>You imply, moreover, that <span class='add'>since he may commit such a deed</span> he can have no reverence for Master, Doctrine, Order, or Training, <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12.8.3' href='#pts-cs12.8.3'>PTS cs 12.8.3</a> while you know, on the other hand, that such a person feels just the opposite.</p>
<p>You<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12.8.4' href='#pts-cs12.8.4'>PTS cs 12.8.4</a> imply, moreover, that such a person may defile Buddha shrines, desecrate them, spit on them, behave as an infidel in presence of them?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12.8.5' href='#pts-cs12.8.5'>PTS cs 12.8.5</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Just as the ocean, <i>bhikkhus</i>, remains of the same nature, and passes not beyond the shore, just so is the body of precepts which I have established for those who are hearers of my word, and which they their lives long do not pass beyond”?</p>
<p>Hence it is not right to say that a person who has attained to sound views may designedly deprive a living creature of life.</p>
