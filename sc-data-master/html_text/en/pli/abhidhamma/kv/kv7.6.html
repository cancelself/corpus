<h1>7.6 Of the Effect of Gifts given in this Life</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That what is given here sustains elsewhere.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.6.1' href='#pts-cs7.6.1'>PTS cs 7.6.1</a>Your proposition commits you to the further statement that robes, alms-food, lodging, medical requisites for ailments, hard food, soft food, and drink, given in this life, are enjoyed in the after-life—which you deny … And it commits you further to this <span class='add'>heterodox position</span>, that one person is the agent for another; that the happiness or ill we feel is wrought by others; that one acts, another experiences the consequences—which you deny … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika, Siddhatthika:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc204' href='#pc204'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.6.2' href='#pts-cs7.6.2'>PTS cs 7.6.2</a>You deny our proposition. But do not the Petas thank him who gives a gift for their advantage, are not their hearts appeased, are they not interested, do they not obtain gladness? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.6.3' href='#pts-cs7.6.3'>PTS cs 7.6.3</a> Was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“As water rained upon high slope<br>
Doth ever down the hillside run,<br>
E'en so whate'er on earth is given<br>
Doth reach the hapless Peta shades.<br>
And as the brimming rivers run<br>
To keep the mighty ocean full.<br>
E'en so whate'er, etc.<br>
For where they dwell no husbandry<br>
Nor tending daily kine is there,<br>
No merchant traffic as with us,<br>
No goods to buy with precious coin.<br>
By what is given here below<br>
They share who, dead, 'mong Petas go”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore our proposition is right.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.6.4' href='#pts-cs7.6.4'>PTS cs 7.6.4</a></p>
<p>Again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, there are these five matters which parents, if wishing for a child to be born to them, contemplate. Which are the five? Cared for (they think) he will care for us; or, he will do our work; he will continue our family; he will inherit our property; he will institute offerings to the departed parent shades (<i>Petas</i>).</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Wise folk who fain a child would have<br>
Have five advantages in view:<br>
Us by his wages he will keep;<br>
His will it be our work to do;</p>
<p>Our <a class='pc' id='pc205' href='#pc205'></a> family will long endure;<br>
Our heritage to him we leave;<br>
And then again an offering<br>
To Peta-shades he'll institute.<br>
These matters five keep well in view<br>
The wise who fain a child would have.<br>
Wherefore the pious and the good,<br>
Children who know and grateful feel,<br>
Support their mother and their sire,<br>
Remembering all these did for them.<br>
Their tasks they take upon themselves,<br>
E'en as their parents toiled for them;<br>
Do their behests and them maintain,<br>
Nor suffer that their race decay.<br>
Praise to the child of filial heart,<br>
With piety and virtue dight”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was it not so said? Then is our proposition right.</p>
