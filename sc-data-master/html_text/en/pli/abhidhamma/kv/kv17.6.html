<h1>17.6 Of the Order and the Accepting of Gifts</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That it ought not to be said “The Order accepts gifts”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.6.1' href='#pts-cs17.6.1'>PTS cs 17.6.1</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But is not the Order worthy of offerings of hospitality, of gifts, of salutations, as the world's supreme field of merit? How then can it be wrong to say it accepts gifts? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.6.2' href='#pts-cs17.6.2'>PTS cs 17.6.2</a> Were not its four pairs of men, its eight classes of individuals declared by the Exalted One to be worthy of gifts? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.6.3' href='#pts-cs17.6.3'>PTS cs 17.6.3</a> And are there not they who give to it?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.6.4' href='#pts-cs17.6.4'>PTS cs 17.6.4</a>Finally, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“As doth the holy flame its offering,<br>
As doth the bounteous earth the summer rain,<br>
So doth the Order, in rapt thought expert,<br>
The Gift accept”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence surely the Order accepts gifts.</p>
