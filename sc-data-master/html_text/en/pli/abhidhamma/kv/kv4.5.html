<h1>4.5 Of the Arahant's Indifference in Sense-Cognition</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That an Arahant is endowed with six indifferences.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.5.1' href='#pts-cs4.5.1'>PTS cs 4.5.1</a>In affirming this proposition, you imply that the Arahant experiences <span class='add'>simultaneously</span> six contacts <span class='add'>between sense-organ (and sense-mind) and their objects</span>, six feelings, perceptions, volitions,… insights—which you deny; that <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.5.2' href='#pts-cs4.5.2'>PTS cs 4.5.2</a> he is using his five senses and mental co-ordination at <span class='add'>the same instant</span>; that <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.5.3' href='#pts-cs4.5.3'>PTS cs 4.5.3</a> he, being continually, constantly, uninterruptedly in possession of, and made intent with six indifferences, six indifferences are present to him—both of which you deny.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Opponent:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.5.4' href='#pts-cs4.5.4'>PTS cs 4.5.4</a>Yet you admit that an Arahant is gifted with sixfold indifference. Is this not admitting my proposition?</p>
