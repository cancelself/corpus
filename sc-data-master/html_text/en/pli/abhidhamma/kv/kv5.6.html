<h1>5.6 Of Popular Knowledge</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc180' href='#pc180'></a>: That it is wrong to say: Popular knowledge has only truth as its object and nothing else.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.6.1' href='#pts-cs5.6.1'>PTS cs 5.6.1</a>You admit, do you not, that one who attains <i>Jhāna</i> by way of the earth-artifice, has knowledge? Does not that earth-artifice come under popular truth?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> Then why exempt popular knowledge from the search for truth?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.6.2' href='#pts-cs5.6.2'>PTS cs 5.6.2</a>The same argument applies to the other artifices, and to gifts as stated above (<a class='cr' href='/kv5.5/en/aung-rhysdavids'>Kv 5.5</a>).</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.6.3' href='#pts-cs5.6.3'>PTS cs 5.6.3</a>Then according to you, popular knowledge <em>has</em> only Truth as its object. But is it the object of popular knowledge to understand the fact and nature of Ill, to put away the Cause, to realize the Cessation, to develop the Path thereto? You must deny. (Hence the need for a distinction between truths.)</p>
