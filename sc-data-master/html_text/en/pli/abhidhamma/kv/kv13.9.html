<h1>13.9 Of the Unmorality of a Natural Desire for Objects of the Mind</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That to crave for objects of the mind is unmoral.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.9.1' href='#pts-cs13.9.1'>PTS cs 13.9.1</a>If that be so, this craving must belong to one of the moral indeterminates—to wit, resultant or inoperative indeterminates—matter, <i>Nibbāna</i>, or the organs and objects of the five senses. But you must deny this <span class='add'>as not doctrinal.</span></p>
<p>Or what reason have you for dissociating this sixth form of <i>taṇhā</i> <span class='add'>natural desire or craving</span> from the rest? If you admit that a craving for objects of sight, sound, and so on is immoral, you must admit as much concerning the co-ordination of these.</p>
<p>Did<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.9.2' href='#pts-cs13.9.2'>PTS cs 13.9.2</a> not the Exalted One call craving immoral? Does not this condemn your proposition? Did he not call appetite (or greed) immoral? and is not craving for objects of the mind a kind of greed?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.9.3' href='#pts-cs13.9.3'>PTS cs 13.9.3</a>Your contention is that a craving for objects of the mind is an unmoral appetite, but you are not justified in using <i>lobha</i> with this qualification, when in the other five modes of sense it is called immoral.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.9.4' href='#pts-cs13.9.4'>PTS cs 13.9.4</a>Again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“This natural desire is concerned with rebirth, is accompanied by delight and lust, dallying here and there—to wit, desires of sense, desire for rebirth, desire not to live again”? … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.9.5' href='#pts-cs13.9.5'>PTS cs 13.9.5</a>But if I am wrong, is not this <span class='add'>threefold</span> craving a craving for certain ideas or mental objects?</p>
<p>Hence surely such a craving is as such immoral.</p>
