<h1>9.10 Of Action conforming to Thought</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That action does not accord with thought.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.10.1-3' href='#pts-cs9.10.1-3'>PTS cs 9.10.1–3</a><span class='pe'><em>(The argument is exactly similar to that in <a class='cr' href='/kv9.9/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs9.9.1'>Kv 9.9 PTS CS 9.9.1</a>–<a class='cr' href='/kv9.9/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs9.9.3'>PTS CS 9.9.3</a>.)</em></span></p>

<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.10.5' href='#pts-cs9.10.5'>PTS cs 9.10.5</a>You say, I am wrong, but does it not happen that some one, thinking “I shall go in one direction”, goes in another, or … thinking “I shall hold forth something”, holds forth another? Hence my proposition is tenable.</p>

<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
<li>Letter-spacing with fixed spaces was replaced with bold font.</li>
