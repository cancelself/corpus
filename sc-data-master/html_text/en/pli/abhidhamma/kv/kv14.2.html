<h1>14.2 Of the Development of Sense-Organs</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the sense-mechanism starts all at once to life in the womb.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.2.1' href='#pts-cs14.2.1'>PTS cs 14.2.1</a>Do you imply that the sense-mechanism enters the womb with all its main and minor parts complete, not deficient in any organ? You deny …<span class='add'>Then let us speak more in detail:</span> You admit that the organ of sight starts by consciousness seeking rebirth? Now, you would not claim, for that questing consciousness that <span class='add'>at its taking effect</span> hands, feet, head, ears, nostrils, mouth and teeth take their start? Why claim an exception in the case of the visual, or other sense-organs?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya, Aparaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.2.2' href='#pts-cs14.2.2'>PTS cs 14.2.2</a>Then you claim that four of the sense-organs—eye, ear, smell, taste—come later into being. Are you implying that, to bring this about, one makes <i>karma</i> in the mother's womb? You deny, but your position implies it.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But you say, do you not, that in the embryo hair, down, nails, teeth, bones, appear at a subsequent stage. Do you imply a special embryonic <i>karma</i> done to bring these to birth? You deny. Then why assail my position? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.2.3' href='#pts-cs14.2.3'>PTS cs 14.2.3</a> Or it may be you do not admit the subsequent appearance of hair, etc.? But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>At first the “<i>kalala</i>” takes birth, and thence<br>
The “<i>abbuda</i>”. Therefrom the “<i>pesī</i>” grows,<br>
Developing as “<i>ghana</i>” in its turn.<br>
Now in the “<i>ghana</i>” doth appear the hair,<br>
The down, the nails. And whatsoever food<br>
And <a class='pc' id='pc285' href='#pc285'></a> drink the mother of him takes, thereby<br>
The man in mother's womb doth live and grow?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence it is right to assign a later appearance to hair, and so forth.</p>
