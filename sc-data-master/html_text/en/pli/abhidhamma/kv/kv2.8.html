<h1>2.8 Of <span class='add'>the World as only a</span> Cinderheap</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That all conditioned things are absolutely cinderheaps.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.8.1' href='#pts-cs2.8.1'>PTS cs 2.8.1</a>You affirm this; but is there not such a thing as pleasurable feeling, bodily pleasure, mental pleasure, celestial happiness, human happiness, the pleasures of gain, of being honoured, of riding-and-driving, of resting, the pleasures of ruling, of administrating, of domestic-and-secular life, of the religious life, pleasures involved in the intoxicants and pleasures that are not, the happiness <span class='add'>of <i>Nibbāna</i></span>, both while stuff of life remains and when none remains, worldly and spiritual pleasures, happiness with <a class='pc' id='pc128' href='#pc128'></a> zest and without zest, <i>Jhāna</i>-happiness, the bliss of liberty, pleasures of sense-desire, and the happiness of renunciation, the bliss of solitude, of peace, of enlightenment? Of course. How then can you maintain your general affirmation?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Gokulika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.8.2' href='#pts-cs2.8.2'>PTS cs 2.8.2</a>My proposition then is wrong? But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“All is on fire, O <i>bhikkhus</i>! How is everything on fire? The eye is on fire; visible objects, visual consciousness, visual contact and the pleasure, the pain, the neutral feeling therefrom—all is on fire. On fire wherewithal? I tell you, on fire with the fires of passion, hate, and ignorance; with the fires of birth, decay, and death; with the fires of sorrow, lamentation, ill, grief, and despair. All the field of sense, all the field of mind, all the feeling therefrom is on fire with those fires”?</p>
<p>Surely then all conditioned things are mere cinderheaps absolutely.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.8.3' href='#pts-cs2.8.3'>PTS cs 2.8.3</a>But was it not also said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“There are these five pleasures of sense, <i>bhikkhus</i>—namely, visible objects seen through the eye as desirable, pleasing, delightful, lovely, adapted to sense-desire, seductive; audible objects, odorous, sapid, tangible objects, desirable, pleasing, delightful, lovely, adapted to sense-desire, seductive …”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Gokulika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.8.4' href='#pts-cs2.8.4'>PTS cs 2.8.4</a>But was it not also said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“A gain is yours, O <i>bhikkhus</i>! well have ye won, for ye have discerned the hour for living the religious life. Hells have I seen, <i>bhikkhus</i>, belonging to the six fields of contact. Hereof whatsoever object is seen by the eye is undesired only, not desired; whatsoever object is sensed by ear, smell, taste, touch, mind, is undesired only, not desired; is unpleasant only, not pleasant; is unlovely only, not lovely”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc129' href='#pc129'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.8.5' href='#pts-cs2.8.5'>PTS cs 2.8.5</a>But was it not also said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“A gain is yours, <i>bhikkhus</i>! well have ye won, for ye have discerned the hour for living the religious life. Heavens have I seen, <i>bhikkhus</i>, belonging to the six fields of contact. Hereof whatsoever object is seen by the eye, or otherwise sensed, is desired only, not undesired; is pleasing only, not unpleasing; is lovely only, not unlovely”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Gokulika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.8.6' href='#pts-cs2.8.6'>PTS cs 2.8.6</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“The impermanent involves Ill; all conditioned things are impermanent”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.8.7' href='#pts-cs2.8.7'>PTS cs 2.8.7</a>But take giving: does that bring forth fruit that is undesired, unpleasant, disagreeable, adulterated? Does it bear, and result in, sorrow? Or take virtue, the keeping of feastdays, religious training, and religious life: do they bring forth such fruit, etc.? Do they not rather have the opposite result? How then can you affirm your general proposition?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.8.8' href='#pts-cs2.8.8'>PTS cs 2.8.8</a>Finally, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Happy his solitude who, glad at heart,<br>
Hath learnt the Norm and doth the vision see!<br>
Happy is that benignity towards<br>
The world which on no creature worketh harm.<br>
Happy the freedom from all lust, th' ascent<br>
Past and beyond the needs of sense-desires.<br>
He who doth crush the great “I am”-conceit:<br>
This, even this, is happiness supreme.<br>
This happiness by happiness is won,<br>
Unending happiness is this alone.<br>
The Threefold Wisdom hath he made his own.<br>
This, even this, is happiness supreme”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You admit the Suttanta says this? How then can you maintain your proposition?</p>
