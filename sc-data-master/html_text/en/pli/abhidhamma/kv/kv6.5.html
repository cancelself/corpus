<h1>6.5 Of the attaining to Cessation</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the attainment of Cessation is unconditioned.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.5.1' href='#pts-cs6.5.1'>PTS cs 6.5.1</a>Does this mean that this state is <i>Nibbāna</i>, the Shelter, etc.? You deny. Then are both similarly described as unconditioned? You affirm? Then are there two unconditioneds … two <i>Nibbānas</i>? … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.5.2' href='#pts-cs6.5.2'>PTS cs 6.5.2</a>Are there any who attain to Cessation, acquire it, cause it to rise, to keep rising, set up, induce, produce, bring to pass, make to be born, to happen? If so, can you so speak of the unconditioned? Of course not … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.5.3' href='#pts-cs6.5.3'>PTS cs 6.5.3</a>Is there apparent such a thing as a purging through, emerging from, Cessation? If so, is there the same from the unconditioned? Of course not … .</p>
<p>In attaining Cessation, first speech, then action, then consciousness ceases. Can you so speak of attaining the unconditioned?</p>
<p>In emerging from Cessation, first consciousness, then action, then speech occurs. Can you so speak of emerging from the unconditioned?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.5.4' href='#pts-cs6.5.4'>PTS cs 6.5.4</a>After emerging from Cessation, one is in touch with three contacts: that of the void, of the signless, of the unhankered-after. Can you so speak of emerging from the unconditioned? Or that, when one emerges from Cessation, consciousness is inclined for, tends to, takes shelter in solitude?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.5.5' href='#pts-cs6.5.5'>PTS cs 6.5.5</a>If we are wrong, we would just ask you, is Cessation conditioned? No, you say; then it must be unconditioned.</p>
