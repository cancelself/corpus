<h1>16.9 Of Matter as belonging to the Material and the Immaterial Heavens</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That matter belongs to (i.) the material heavens, (ii.) the immaterial heavens.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.9.1' href='#pts-cs16.9.1'>PTS cs 16.9.1</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Then you must describe matter <span class='add'>in terms descriptive of (i.) that is to say</span> as seeking attainment in <i>Jhāna</i>, as seeking rebirth on those planes, as living happily under present conditions, as accompanied by a mind that seeks that attainment and that rebirth, and that lives in that happiness; as coexistent with such a mind, associated, conjoined with it, one with it in genesis, in cessation, in physical basis, as having the same objects before it …<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.9.2' href='#pts-cs16.9.2'>PTS cs 16.9.2</a> and you must describe matter <span class='add'>in terms descriptive of (ii.) that is to say</span> in the same terms as we apply to (i.).
