<h1>17.3 Of Everything as due to <i>Karma</i></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc314' href='#pc314'></a>: That all this is from <i>karma</i>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.3.1' href='#pts-cs17.3.1'>PTS cs 17.3.1</a>Do you then include <i>karma</i> itself as due to <i>karma</i>? And do you imply that all this is simply the result of bygone causes? You are committed here to what you must deny.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.3.2' href='#pts-cs17.3.2'>PTS cs 17.3.2</a>Again, you imply, by your proposition, that all this is <span class='add'>not so much from <i>karma</i> as</span> from the result of <span class='add'>still earlier</span> <i>karma</i>. If you deny, you deny your first proposition. If you assent, you imply that one may commit murder through <span class='add'>not <i>karma</i>, but</span> the result of <i>karma</i>. You assent? Then murder, <span class='add'>though a result</span>, is itself <a class='pc' id='pc315' href='#pc315'></a> productive of <span class='add'>karmic</span> result? You assent? Then the result of <i>karma</i> is productive of result? You deny? Then it is barren of result, and murder must <i>a fortiori</i> be barren of <span class='add'>karmic</span> result … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.3.3' href='#pts-cs17.3.3'>PTS cs 17.3.3</a>This argument applies equally to other immoral acts—to theft, to wicked speech—lying, abuse, slander, and idle talk—to burglary, raiding, looting, highway robbery, adultery, destroying houses in village or town. It applies equally to moral acts: to giving gifts—<span class='add'>e.g.</span>, giving the four necessaries <span class='add'>to the religious</span>. If any of these is done as the result of <i>karma</i>, and themselves produce karmic result, then <span class='add'>you are on the horns of this dilemma: that</span> either result-of-<i>karma</i> can itself produce effects <span class='add'>which is heterodox</span>, or any good or bad deed has no karmic result <span class='add'>which is heterodox</span>… .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika, Siddhatthika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.3.4' href='#pts-cs17.3.4'>PTS cs 17.3.4</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“'Tis <i>karma</i> makes the world go round,<br>
<i>Karma</i> rolls on the lives of men.<br>
All beings are to <i>karma</i> bound<br>
As linch-pin is to chariot-wheel”.</p>
<p>“By <i>karma</i> praise and fame are won.<br>
By <i>karma</i> too, birth, death and bonds.<br>
Who that this <span class='add'><i>karma</i>'s</span> divers modes discerns,<br>
Can say “there is no <i>karma</i> in the world”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence surely all this is due to <i>karma</i>?</p>
