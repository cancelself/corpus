<h1>9.7 Of Initial Application of Mind and its Field of Operation</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That initial mental application “falls” on all consciousness.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.7.1' href='#pts-cs9.7.1'>PTS cs 9.7.1</a>If that is true, you must also be prepared to admit in detail that <span class='add'>other mental properties</span> sustained application, zest, pleasure, pain, gladness, melancholy, indifference, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, understanding, lust, hate … indiscretion fall on (or operate in) all consciousness. But you are not so prepared … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.7.3' href='#pts-cs9.7.3'>PTS cs 9.7.3</a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.7.4' href='#pts-cs9.7.4'>PTS cs 9.7.4</a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.7.2-4' href='#pts-cs9.7.2-4'>PTS cs 9.7.2–4</a>Contrariwise, is there not concentration with sustained application only, not initial application; also concentration wherein there is neither kind of application? Were not, in fact, three kinds of concentrative exercise distinguished by the Exalted One: (1) With both modes of application; (2) with the sustained mode only; (3) with neither?</p>
<p>Hence your proposition is wrong.</p>
