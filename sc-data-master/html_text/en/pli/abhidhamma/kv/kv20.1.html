<h1>20.1 Of Unintentional Crime</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc343' href='#pc343'></a>: That the five cardinal crimes, even when unintentionally committed, involve retribution immediately after death.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.1.1' href='#pts-cs20.1.1'>PTS cs 20.1.1</a>But you imply that if I accidentally take away life, I am a murderer, <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.1.2' href='#pts-cs20.1.2'>PTS cs 20.1.2</a> and <span class='add'>similarly as to the other four wicked deeds forbidden by morality</span> that if I accidentally take what is not given, I am a thief … if I utter untruths unintentionally, I am a liar. You deny. Yet you wish to make exceptions <span class='add'>to the relative innocence of such acts</span> in just those five serious cases … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.1.3' href='#pts-cs20.1.3'>PTS cs 20.1.3</a>Can you cite me a Sutta judging unintentional crime like that which says:</p>
<p>“He that intentionally takes his mother's life incurs immediate retribution”?</p>
<p>You cannot. Neither can you maintain your proposition.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.1.4' href='#pts-cs20.1.4'>PTS cs 20.1.4</a>But does not the fact remain that the mother's life is taken? Surely then the unintentional slayer also incurs immediate retribution. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.1.5-7' href='#pts-cs20.1.5-7'>PTS cs 20.1.5–7</a> Similarly, too, does <a class='pc' id='pc344' href='#pc344'></a> one who unintentionally kills father or Arahant, or sheds a Buddha's blood, incur a like doom.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.1.8' href='#pts-cs20.1.8'>PTS cs 20.1.8</a><span class='add'>Now as to the fifth of such crimes</span>: do you imply that all schismatics incur such a doom? You deny. But think again! You now assent. But does a schismatic who is conscious of right incur it? You deny. But think again! You now assent. But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“There is a kind of schismatic, Upāli, who incurs disaster, purgatory, misery for an æon on, who is incurable; there is a kind of schismatic, Upāli, who does not incur such a doom, who is not incurable”?</p>
<p>Hence it is not right to say that a schismatic who is conscious of <span class='add'>stating what is</span> right incurs such a doom.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.1.9' href='#pts-cs20.1.9'>PTS cs 20.1.9</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“He who breaks up the Order<br>
is doomed to remain for an æon on<br>
in states of suffering and woe?</p>
<p>“He who delights in party strife,<br>
and adheres not to the Dhamma,<br>
is cut off from Arahantship.<br>
Having broken up the Order when it was at peace,<br>
he must be cooked for an æon on in purgatory”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence surely a schismatic incurs retribution immediately after death.</p>
