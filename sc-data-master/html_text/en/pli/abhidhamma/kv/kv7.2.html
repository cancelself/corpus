<h1>7.2 Of Mental States as mutually connected</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That mental states are not connected with other mental states.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.2.1' href='#pts-cs7.2.1'>PTS cs 7.2.1</a>But you do not also deny that some things are concomitant, co-existent, compounded with other things, arise and cease together with them, have the same physical basis and the same object? Why then except the relation “connected with”?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.2.2' href='#pts-cs7.2.2'>PTS cs 7.2.2</a>One aggregate, for instance, may be co-existent with another: feeling with perception, mental coefficients, consciousness, and so on. Surely then it may be “connected with” that other.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika, Siddhatthika:</span> Then do you understand that one such state accompanies, pervades another state, just as oil pervades sesamum, or sugar pervades cane?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Nay, that cannot truly be said.</p>

<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by <span class='editor'>Manfred Wierich</span> and <span class='editor'>Ven. Vimala</span> and proofread by <span class='editor'>Josephine Tobin</span>. Some changes were introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbreviations, i.e., those of cited works and the participants in the controversies, were expanded.</li>
<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
<li>Letter-spacing with fixed spaces was replaced with bold font.</li>
<li>The corrigenda were merged into the text. Some could not be resolved, though.</li>
