<h1>8.9 Of Matter as ethically Good or Bad</h1>

<p><a class='pc' id='pc221' href='#pc221'></a><a class='pc' id='pc219' href='#pc219'></a></p>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That physical actions <span class='add'>involved in bodily and vocal intimations</span> proceeding from good or bad thoughts amount to a moral act of <i>karma</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.1' href='#pts-cs8.9.1'>PTS cs 8.9.1</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> If that be so—if <i>rūpa</i> involved in bodily action be of morally good import—then it must have a mental object, and the mental attributes of “adverting”, ideating, co-ordinated application, attending, willing, anticipating, <a class='pc' id='pc222' href='#pc222'></a> aiming, which you deny. But otherwise it is not good.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.2' href='#pts-cs8.9.2'>PTS cs 8.9.2</a>All these things you can predicate about the good contact proceeding from good consciousness, as well as about the good feeling, perception, volition, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, understanding, that proceed from good consciousness, and have an object of thought, but you cannot do so about <i>rūpa</i> involved in bodily action.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.3' href='#pts-cs8.9.3'>PTS cs 8.9.3</a>Or again, you would admit that, if <i>rūpa</i> of the kind you name has no mental object, it will have no mental adverting, ideating, and so on; but you would deny that contact, feeling, perception, and the rest, similarly proceeding from good thought—good, but without mental object—lacked mental adverting, ideating, and so on.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.4' href='#pts-cs8.9.4'>PTS cs 8.9.4</a>Now take the matter involved in the bodily action, resulting from good thought: Is all of it morally good? You deny. But then you cannot maintain your proposition as generally true. For instance, would you call visible object which was the consequence of good thought, “good” matter? Are audible, odorous, sapid, or tangible objects, or the four elements: extended, cohesive, hot, and mobile, <span class='add'>if they “happened” as</span> the result of good thought, “good” matter? You deny. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.5' href='#pts-cs8.9.5'>PTS cs 8.9.5</a> Then would you call any of them, under the circumstances, indeterminate matter (neither good nor bad)? “Yes” you say; yet you deny that the matter or material quality appearing, under the circumstances, as bodily action is indeterminate. That, you say, would be “good”… .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.6' href='#pts-cs8.9.6'>PTS cs 8.9.6</a>Let us then take your “good” bodily action which, as matter, has no mental object: must you not equally allow that visible or other sense-object, or those four elements which, as matter, have no mental object, are also, under the circumstances, “good”? But you deny …<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.7' href='#pts-cs8.9.7'>PTS cs 8.9.7</a> Similarly you refuse to see that, if you allow <a class='pc' id='pc223' href='#pc223'></a> any sense-object, or any element brought about by good thought, and having no mental object, to be indeterminate, you must equally allow the “matter” of bodily intimation resulting from good thought and with no mental object, to be indeterminate … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.8' href='#pts-cs8.9.8'>PTS cs 8.9.8</a>You call this bodily intimation, which is consequent on good thought, “good” matter <span class='add'>even though it is so unmental as</span> not to be conjoined with any <span class='add'>mental reaction or</span> “contact”. Yet you would deny the possibility of this if, for “bodily intimation”, you substitute any sense-object, or one of the elements.</p>
<p>Taken<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.9' href='#pts-cs8.9.9'>PTS cs 8.9.9</a> conversely, you allow that any object of sense or an element consequent on good thought, but not conjoined with any mental reaction, is indeterminate (neither good nor bad). Yet you would deny the indeterminateness if, for sense-object or element, you substitute matter of bodily action born of good thought.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.10-11' href='#pts-cs8.9.10-11'>PTS cs 8.9.10–11</a>And if to “not conjoined with mental reaction or contact” I add “not having a mental object”, your attitude is the same, in both alternatives (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs8.9.8'>PTS CS 8.9.8</a>).</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.12-15' href='#pts-cs8.9.12-15'>PTS cs 8.9.12–15</a><span class='pe'><em>The whole argument to be repeated for</em> “vocal” <em>instead of</em> “bodily intimation”.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.16' href='#pts-cs8.9.16'>PTS cs 8.9.16</a>Next with respect to bodily intimation proceeding from bad thought. You affirm similarly that this is “morally bad” matter. Then it too must have a mental object, and those mental attributes named above, which you deny. But otherwise it is not morally bad. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.17' href='#pts-cs8.9.17'>PTS cs 8.9.17</a> All these things you can predicate about the bad reaction, or “contact”, proceeding from bad consciousness, as well as about the bad feeling, perception, volition, lust, hate and dullness, pride, erroneous opinion, doubt, sloth, distraction, immodesty, and indiscretion, that proceed from bad consciousness, having a mental object, but you cannot do so about that bodily intimation, which is <i>rūpa</i>, or of material quality.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.18' href='#pts-cs8.9.18'>PTS cs 8.9.18</a>Or again, you will admit that, if bad <i>rūpa</i> of the kind you name has no mental object, it will have no mental adverting and other mental attributes named above; but <a class='pc' id='pc224' href='#pc224'></a> you will deny that contact, feeling, perception, volition, lust, hate, and so on, proceeding from bad thought, bad and having no mental object, lack mental adverting and those other attributes … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.19' href='#pts-cs8.9.19'>PTS cs 8.9.19</a>Now this that you call “morally bad” matter proceeding from bad consciousness: is all of it bad? Yes? Whether it be “bodily intimation”, or other material quality? This you deny, so your proposition amounts to this: that some material qualities resulting from bad consciousness are bad, some not.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.20-23' href='#pts-cs8.9.20-23'>PTS cs 8.9.20–23</a>And all that we have argued as to “bodily intimation” as “bad” matter applies to “vocal intimation”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.24' href='#pts-cs8.9.24'>PTS cs 8.9.24</a>For instance, would you call visible object which was the consequence of bad consciousness “bad” matter? Or audible, odorous, sapid, or tangible matter? Or any of the four elements? Or impure matter, tears, blood, sweat (if any of them happened as the result of bad consciousness)—would you call them “bad” matter? You deny. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.25' href='#pts-cs8.9.25'>PTS cs 8.9.25</a> Then would you call any of them, under the circumstances, indeterminate matter? “Yes”, you say. Yet you deny that the matter or material quality appearing, under the circumstances, as bodily or vocal action, is indeterminate. That, you say, would be “bad”…</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.26' href='#pts-cs8.9.26'>PTS cs 8.9.26</a>Let us then take your “bad” vocal action, which, as material, has no mental object: must you not equally allow that any sense-object, or any of the four elements, or impure matter, tears, blood, sweat, which have no mental object, are also, under the circumstances, “bad”? But you deny …<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.27' href='#pts-cs8.9.27'>PTS cs 8.9.27</a> Similarly you refuse to see that, if you allow any of these things, when brought about by thought, and having no mental object, to be indeterminate, you must equally allow the “matter”, bodily or vocal, of action resulting from bad thought, and with no mental object, to be indeterminate.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.28-31' href='#pts-cs8.9.28-31'>PTS cs 8.9.28–31</a><span class='pe'><em>These paragraphs are simply repetitions of <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs8.9.8'>PTS CS 8.9.8</a>, substituting</em> “bad” <em>for</em> “good”, “vocal” <em>for</em> “bodily”, <em>and adding</em> “impure matter, tears, blood, sweat” <em>to the sense-objects and four elements</em>.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahisāsaka, Sammitiya:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc225' href='#pc225'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.32' href='#pts-cs8.9.32'>PTS cs 8.9.32</a>But if we may not say that matter is good or bad, is not deed or word as an act good or bad? <span class='add'>This being quite orthodox,</span> our proposition must be right.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.33' href='#pts-cs8.9.33'>PTS cs 8.9.33</a>But if you maintain that matter is good or bad, you must not hesitate to say that all five organs and objects of sense, the four elements and impure matter, etc., are (intrinsically) good or bad—which you deny. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.34' href='#pts-cs8.9.34'>PTS cs 8.9.34</a> If body and bodily action be material, would you affirm that mind and mental action are so? If these, on the contrary, are both immaterial, would you affirm that both body and bodily action are immaterial? Or if body is material and bodily action immaterial, would you speak similarly of mind and mental action? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.35' href='#pts-cs8.9.35'>PTS cs 8.9.35</a> To say that bodily action as well as body is material, involves such statements as “sense-consciousness is material because the sense-organs are material”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.36' href='#pts-cs8.9.36'>PTS cs 8.9.36</a>You must not say that <i>rūpa</i>, or matter, is action (or <i>karma</i>). For was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“I say, <i>bhikkhus</i>, that volition is <i>karma</i>; when we have willed, then we make action (or <i>karma</i>) by deed, word, and thought”?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.37' href='#pts-cs8.9.37'>PTS cs 8.9.37</a>And again:</p>
<p>“When, Ānanda, there is action, subjective pleasure or pain arises because it is well determined by the deed. So also when there is speech or thought, subjective pleasure or pain arises because it is well determined by the action of speech or of thought”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.38' href='#pts-cs8.9.38'>PTS cs 8.9.38</a>And again:</p>
<p>“There are, <i>bhikkhus</i>, three modes of volitional acts of body, four modes of volitional acts of speech, and three modes of volitional acts of mind, all of which amount to immoral deeds, bringing forth ill and entailing it as result. And there are a like number of modes of volitional acts of body, <a class='pc' id='pc226' href='#pc226'></a> speech, and mind amounting to moral <i>karma</i>, bringing forth and entailing happiness as result”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.9.39' href='#pts-cs8.9.39'>PTS cs 8.9.39</a>Once more:</p>
<p>“If, Ānanda, this foolish man, Samiddhi, when asked by the Wanderer Pātaliputta, were to answer: `Brother Pātaliputta, it is when anyone has acted intentionally in deed, word, and thought that he comes to feel pleasant, or painful, or neutral feeling, felt as pleasure, as pain, or as neither': so answering he would make right answer”?</p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus? Then it is not right to say: Matter, or material quality, is <i>karma</i> (action).</p>
