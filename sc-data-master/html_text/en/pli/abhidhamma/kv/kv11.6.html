<h1>11.6 Of Concentration</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the continuity of consciousness is concentration of mind (<i>samādhi</i>).</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.6.1' href='#pts-cs11.6.1'>PTS cs 11.6.1</a>Your statement must include of course past and future states of consciousness in the series. You forgot that, and you must agree that the past having ceased and the future being unborn, it is not right to say that they form a <span class='add'>present</span> concentrated state of mind.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Sabbatthivādin, Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc261' href='#pc261'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.6.2' href='#pts-cs11.6.2'>PTS cs 11.6.2</a>Then is concentration confined to a momentary conscious unit?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Sabbatthivādin, Uttarāpathaka:</span> But if you could affirm that concentration is involved in each momentary unit of consciousness, you should say no less that one had won the ecstasy of <i>Jhāna</i> on the actual occasion of any sense-cognition, or at the very moment of thinking immoral thoughts, accompanied by lust, hate, dullness, or any of the ten corruptions … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.6.3' href='#pts-cs11.6.3'>PTS cs 11.6.3</a>If your proposition is true, it must also be true <i>a fortiori</i> that a series of <em>bad</em> conscious units is concentration, whether it is accompanied by lust, hate, or any of the ten corruptions. This you deny … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Sabbatthivādin, Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.6.4' href='#pts-cs11.6.4'>PTS cs 11.6.4</a>But if we are wrong, did not the Exalted One say:</p>
<p>“I, friend Jainas, am able, without moving the body or using the voice, to spend seven nights and days in the experience of absolute bliss”?</p>
<p>Surely then the flow of consciousness constitutes concentration of mind.</p>
