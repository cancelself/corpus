<h1>16.8 Of Matter as Result</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That material qualities are results <span class='add'>of <i>karma</i>.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.8.1' href='#pts-cs16.8.1'>PTS cs 16.8.1</a>Do you mean to imply that matter is of the nature of feeling, pleasurable, painful, or neutral, that it is conjoined with feeling, with mental reaction, and other phases of consciousness, that it has the properties of mental adverting, adjustment, etc.? Is not the contrary the case? If you assent, you cannot maintain your proposition.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.8.2' href='#pts-cs16.8.2'>PTS cs 16.8.2</a>All those things are mental characteristics, not material. But you wish to see in matter a “result” of <i>karma</i>, without the mental characters which are the properties of “result”… .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Sammitiya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.8.3' href='#pts-cs16.8.3'>PTS cs 16.8.3</a>But is not consciousness and its concomitant attributes, which arise through actions done, “result”? Surely then material qualities, which arise through actions done, are equally “result”?</p>
