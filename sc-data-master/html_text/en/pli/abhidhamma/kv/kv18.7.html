<h1>18.7 Of <i>Jhāna</i> and its Intervals</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That there is an intermediate stage between the First and Second Stages.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc330' href='#pc330'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.1' href='#pts-cs18.7.1'>PTS cs 18.7.1</a>But this is to imply intervening stages between contact or feeling, or perception …</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.2' href='#pts-cs18.7.2'>PTS cs 18.7.2</a>Again, why deny intermediate stages between Second and Third, or Third and Fourth <i>Jhāna</i>? If you deny them here, you must deny them between First and Second <i>Jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.3' href='#pts-cs18.7.3'>PTS cs 18.7.3</a>You cannot maintain the intermediate stages between First and Second <i>Jhāna</i> only, <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.4' href='#pts-cs18.7.4'>PTS cs 18.7.4</a> denying the existence of such stages between the others.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.5' href='#pts-cs18.7.5'>PTS cs 18.7.5</a>You say that concentration of mind accompanied by sustained thought only, without its initial application, constitutes the intermediate stage. But why make an exception in this way? Or why not include the other two forms, accompanied by both or by neither? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.6' href='#pts-cs18.7.6'>PTS cs 18.7.6</a> If you deny that concentration with or without initial and sustained application of thought is a Jhānic interval, why not deny it in the case of concentration without initial application, but with sustentation of thought?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.7' href='#pts-cs18.7.7'>PTS cs 18.7.7</a>You maintain that in the interval between the manifestation of two stages of <i>Jhāna</i> there is concentration in sustained thought only, without initial application of thought. But while such concentration is proceeding, is not the first <i>Jhāna</i> at an end and the second <i>Jhāna</i> manifested? You assent, but you contradict thus your proposition.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Sammitiya, Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.8' href='#pts-cs18.7.8'>PTS cs 18.7.8</a>If we are wrong, does concentration in sustained thought only, without initial application of thought, constitute any one of the Four <i>Jhāna</i>s? You say, no. Then it must constitute an interim state—which is what we affirm.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.7.9' href='#pts-cs18.7.9'>PTS cs 18.7.9</a>But did not the Exalted One declare three forms of concentration, namely, in both applied and sustained thought, in the latter only, and where there is neither? If so, you cannot single out the second form of concentration as a state intermediate between <i>Jhāna</i>s.</p>
