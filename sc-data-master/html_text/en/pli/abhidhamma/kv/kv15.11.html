<h1>15.11 Of <i>Karma</i> and its Accumulation</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That <i>karma</i> is one thing, its accumulation is another.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc301' href='#pc301'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.11.1' href='#pts-cs15.11.1'>PTS cs 15.11.1</a>Are you then prepared to admit that each mental phase—mental reaction, feeling, perception, volition, cognition, also faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, understanding, also the ten corruptions (<i>kilesas</i>)—is a different thing from its accumulation? Of course not. Then neither can you affirm your proposition.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.11.2' href='#pts-cs15.11.2'>PTS cs 15.11.2</a>Again, do you imply that karmic accumulation is coexistent with <i>karma</i>? You deny? But think! You assent. Then <i>a fortiori</i> meritorious (or good) <i>karma</i> is</p>
<p>coexistent with good karmic accumulation? No? Nay, you must admit it is. Then <span class='add'>it follows that</span> <i>karma</i>, <span class='add'>being inseparably</span> conjoined with feeling, is both coexistent with its accumulation, and also inseparably conjoined with corresponding feeling.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.11.3' href='#pts-cs15.11.3'>PTS cs 15.11.3</a>Similarly for demeritorious (or bad) <i>karma</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.11.4' href='#pts-cs15.11.4'>PTS cs 15.11.4</a>Again, you admit of course that <i>karma</i> is coexistent with consciousness and has a mental object, but you do not admit as much of its accumulation. That is to say, you agree that <i>karma</i>, being coexistent with consciousness, is broken off <span class='add'>as mental process</span> when consciousness is broken off. But, by your view of the different nature of karmic accumulation, you hold that when consciousness stops, karmic accumulation does not <span class='add'>necessarily</span> stop. So that we may get a cessation of <i>karma</i> as conscious process, and a continuation of karmic accumulation as</p>
<p>product!</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.11.5' href='#pts-cs15.11.5'>PTS cs 15.11.5</a>You admit, further, that karmic accumulation is where <i>karma</i> is. Surely this implies that an act (<i>kamma</i>) and its (accumulation or) conservation is one and the same thing … And that, the conservation of karmic energy being where <i>karma</i> is, result is produced from that conservation; and that you must conclude that there is no differ<a class='pc' id='pc302' href='#pc302'></a>ence in kind between <i>karma</i>, its conservation and its result. Yet this you deny.</p>
<p>Now you have admitted that <i>karma</i> has a mental object, and you also admit <span class='add'>of course</span> that result, which is produced from the conservation of <i>karma</i>, has a mental object. But you deny that the conservation is of this nature, even while you admit that where <i>karma</i> is, there, too, is its conservation, producing the result!… .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.11.6' href='#pts-cs15.11.6'>PTS cs 15.11.6</a>Finally, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Here, Puṇṇa, is one who plans activities in deed, word and thought, either malevolent or benevolent. In consequence hereof he is reborn in a world either of malevolence or of benevolence; and when his mental reaction to good and bad shall set in, his sensations are in accordance herewith, and his feelings are a mixture of pleasure and pain, as is the case with human beings, with certain of the devas, and with some of the fallen angels. Now thus, Puṇṇa, is the rebirth of creatures conspicuous and obscure: by that which he does is he reborn, and being reborn mental reactions affect him. And so I say, Puṇṇa, that beings are the heirs of their own actions (<i>karma</i>)”?</p>
<p>Hence it is not right to say that conservation of <i>karma</i> is a thing apart from <i>karma</i> itself.</p>
