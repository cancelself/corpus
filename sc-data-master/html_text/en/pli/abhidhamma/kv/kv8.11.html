<h1>8.11 Of a Result of <i>Karma</i></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That because of <i>karma</i> an Arahant may fall away from Arahantship.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.11.1-2' href='#pts-cs8.11.1-2'>PTS cs 8.11.1–2</a>How can you affirm this without also affirming—which you will not—that those in the three lower stages of fruition may fall away from their fruit?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.11.3' href='#pts-cs8.11.3'>PTS cs 8.11.3</a>And your claim is that he may fall away, not because of such <i>karma</i>, or prior action, as murder, theft, fornication, evil speech, matricide, parricide, Arahanticide, wounding a Buddha, or schism-making, but because of having calumniated Arahants. You affirm he may fall away because of having calumniated Arahants, but you deny that everyone who calumniates Arahants realizes Arahantship. Therefore your proposition that falling is due to calumniation is absurd.</p>
