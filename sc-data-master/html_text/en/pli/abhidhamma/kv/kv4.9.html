<h1>4.9 More about Endowment</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That a person who is practising in order to realize Arahantship possesses <span class='add'>as a persistent distinct endowment</span> the preceding three fruitions.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.1' href='#pts-cs4.9.1'>PTS cs 4.9.1</a>You say, in fact, that such a person is endowed with, or possesses four contacts, four feelings, four perceptions, volitions, thoughts, four faiths, energies, mindfulnesses, concentrations, understandings—which cannot be.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.2' href='#pts-cs4.9.2'>PTS cs 4.9.2</a>Do you make an analogous assertion as to one who is practising for the Third or Second Paths? An analo<a class='pc' id='pc171' href='#pc171'></a>gous paradox will apply in that case; and you must <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.3-4' href='#pts-cs4.9.3-4'>PTS cs 4.9.3–4</a> be able to describe such persons in terms of lower stages, <span class='add'>e.g.</span>, one practising for the topmost stage in terms of one who has only got to the first—which is anomalous.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.5' href='#pts-cs4.9.5'>PTS cs 4.9.5</a>But can a person who is a proximate candidate for Arahantship be described in terms of a Stream-Winner? Can he be both at the same time? Even if he be a Never-Returner, is he rightly so described when he is in process of becoming Arahant? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.6' href='#pts-cs4.9.6'>PTS cs 4.9.6</a> Similarly for a candidate for the Third and Second Fruitions.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.7' href='#pts-cs4.9.7'>PTS cs 4.9.7</a>Would you not rather maintain that a person practising in order to realize Arahantship had evolved past the fruition of Stream-Winning?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.8' href='#pts-cs4.9.8'>PTS cs 4.9.8</a>Or do you maintain that one so evolved was still holding that first Fruit <span class='add'>as a distinctive quality</span>? For then you must also hold that he also remains possessed of those evil qualities which as Stream-Winner he has evolved out of—which is absurd.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.9-18' href='#pts-cs4.9.9-18'>PTS cs 4.9.9–18</a>A similar argument applies to a proximate candidate for Arahantship (Fourth Fruit) and the Second Path and Fruit; to such a candidate and the Third Path and Fruit; to a proximate candidate for the Third Fruit and the First and Second Paths and Fruits; and to a proximate candidate for the Second Fruit, and the First Path and Fruit.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka, Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.19' href='#pts-cs4.9.19'>PTS cs 4.9.19</a>If our proposition is wrong, surely you would nevertheless say that a person who is a proximate candidate for realizing Arahantship had both won the preceding three Fruits, and had not fallen away from them?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Yes, that is true.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka, Andhaka:</span> Surely then he is still possessed of them. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.20-21' href='#pts-cs4.9.20-21'>PTS cs 4.9.20–21</a> And so for candidates in the Third, Second and First Paths.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Assuming<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.22' href='#pts-cs4.9.22'>PTS cs 4.9.22</a> that he is still possessed of the three Fruits, do you also admit that, having attained to all four Paths, he is still possessed of all the Paths? Of course you do not; <span class='add'>there at least you see my point</span><a class='pc' id='pc172' href='#pc172'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.9.23-24' href='#pts-cs4.9.23-24'>PTS cs 4.9.23–24</a>, neither do you admit a similar possession in other candidates.</p>
