<h1>3.10 Of Moral Restraint</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That there is self-control among devas.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc153' href='#pc153'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.10.1' href='#pts-cs3.10.1'>PTS cs 3.10.1</a>Since you affirm its existence, you imply also <span class='add'>that there may be</span> absence of it among devas. You deny this, meaning that there is no want of it among devas. Then you imply that there is no <span class='add'>need of</span> self-control among them—this again you deny, by your proposition.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.10.2' href='#pts-cs3.10.2'>PTS cs 3.10.2</a>Granting that virtue is restraint from absence of self-restraint, does this restraint exist among devas? “Yes”, you say, but you are hereby implying also the coexistence of absence of self-restraint. And this you deny.</p>
<p>Yet <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.10.3' href='#pts-cs3.10.3'>PTS cs 3.10.3</a> you admit the coexistence among humans. Why not among devas? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.10.4' href='#pts-cs3.10.4'>PTS cs 3.10.4</a> For instance, you say “devas abstain from taking life, from intoxicating drinks”. Yet you deny that these vices are found among them. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.10.5' href='#pts-cs3.10.5'>PTS cs 3.10.5</a> You contend they are not found among them, yet you will not allow that restraint from them is not found either, <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.10.6-7' href='#pts-cs3.10.6-7'>PTS cs 3.10.6–7</a> although you allow the coexistence of both among men.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Opponent:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.10.8' href='#pts-cs3.10.8'>PTS cs 3.10.8</a>But if moral restraint is absent among devas, surely you are implying that all devas are takers of life, thieves, etc. They are not, hence, etc.… .</p>
