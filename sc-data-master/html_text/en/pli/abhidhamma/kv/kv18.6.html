<h1>18.6 Of the Transition from One <i>Jhāna</i> to Another</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That we pass from one <i>Jhāna</i> to another <span class='add'>immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc329' href='#pc328'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.6.1' href='#pts-cs18.6.1'>PTS cs 18.6.1</a>Does this imply that one can pass over from First to Third, from Second to Fourth <i>Jhāna</i>? You deny <span class='add'>setting an arbitrary limit</span>… .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.6.2' href='#pts-cs18.6.2'>PTS cs 18.6.2</a>Or take only a passing over from First <i>Jhāna</i> attainment to that of Second—which you affirm to be possible—you are implying that the mental process—adverting, reflecting, co-ordinating, attending, willing, wishing, aiming—called up for First <i>Jhāna</i> is the same as that required for Second <i>Jhāna</i>. But you dissent. Do you mean that no <span class='add'>preliminary</span> mental process of adverting, etc., is required for Second <i>Jhāna</i>? On the contrary, you agree that Second <i>Jhāna</i> arises after a certain mental process—adverting, etc. Therefore one does <span class='add'>not</span> pass over directly from First <i>Jhāna</i> to the next.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.6.3' href='#pts-cs18.6.3'>PTS cs 18.6.3</a><span class='add'>Again, take the objects and characteristics of First <i>Jhāna</i>.</span> The First Stage, you admit, may come to pass while one is considering the harmfulness of sense-desires; moreover, it is accompanied by application and sustentation of thought. But neither that object nor these characteristics, you must admit, belong to the Second Stage. Yet your proposition really commits you to asserting identity between First and Second <i>Jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.6.4' href='#pts-cs18.6.4'>PTS cs 18.6.4</a>The same argument applies to transition from Second to Third <i>Jhāna</i>. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.6.5' href='#pts-cs18.6.5'>PTS cs 18.6.5</a> <span class='add'>Again, take the specific objects and characteristics of the Second Stage:</span> the Second Stage, you admit, may come to pass while one is considering the harmfulness of application and sustentation of thought; moreover, it is accompanied by zest. But neither that object nor these characteristics, you must admit, belong to the Third Stage. Yet your proposition really commits you to an assertion of identity between Second and Third <i>Jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.6.6' href='#pts-cs18.6.6'>PTS cs 18.6.6</a>The same argument applies to transition from Third to Fourth <i>Jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.6.7' href='#pts-cs18.6.7'>PTS cs 18.6.7</a><span class='add'>Again, take the specific objects and characteristics of the Third Stage:</span> the Third Stage, you admit, may come to pass while one is considering the harmfulness of zest; moreover, it is accompanied by happiness. But neither that object nor these characteristics, you must admit, belong to the Fourth Stage. Yet your proposition really commits you to an assertion of identity between Third and Fourth <i>Jhāna</i>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahiṁsāsaka, Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.6.8' href='#pts-cs18.6.8'>PTS cs 18.6.8</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Here, bkikkhus, when a <i>bhikkhu</i>, aloof from sense-desires, etc.… attains to and abides in First … Fourth <i>Jhāna</i>”?</p>
<p>According to that <span class='add'>formula</span> one does pass over immediately from <i>Jhāna</i> to <i>Jhāna</i>.</p>
