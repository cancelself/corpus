<h1>5.8 Of Insight into the Future</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc182' href='#pc182'></a>: That there is knowledge of the future.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.8.1' href='#pts-cs5.8.1'>PTS cs 5.8.1</a>If we can know about the future <span class='add'>in general</span>, it must be <span class='add'>as in other knowledge</span> through knowing its root, condition, cause, source, origin, upspringing, support, basis, correlation, genesis. But you deny that we know the future thus … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.8.2' href='#pts-cs5.8.2'>PTS cs 5.8.2</a>And it must be <span class='add'>as in other knowledge</span> through knowing how it will be correlated by condition, base, predominance, contiguity, and immediate contiguity. But you deny here again … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.8.3' href='#pts-cs5.8.3'>PTS cs 5.8.3</a>Again, if you are right, one in the stage of adoption has insight into the First Path, one in the First Path has insight into the First Fruition, and so on. But you deny here again … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.8.4' href='#pts-cs5.8.4'>PTS cs 5.8.4</a>If I am wrong, is there not a Suttanta in which the Exalted One said:</p>
<p>“To Patna, Ānanda, three disasters will happen: by fire or by water or by rupture of friendship”?</p>
<p>Surely then the future may be known.</p>
