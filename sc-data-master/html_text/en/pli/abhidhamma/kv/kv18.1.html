<h1>18.1 Of the Buddha and this World</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc323' href='#pc323'></a>: That it is not right to say “The Exalted Buddha lived in the world of mankind”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.1.1' href='#pts-cs18.1.1'>PTS cs 18.1.1</a>But are there not shrines, parks, settlements, villages, towns, kingdoms, countries mentioned by the Buddha? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.1.2' href='#pts-cs18.1.2'>PTS cs 18.1.2</a> And was he not born at Lumbinī, super-enlightened under the Bodhi tree? Was not the Norm-wheel set rolling by him at Benares? Did he not renounce the will to live at the Chāpāla shrine? Did he not complete existence at Kusinārā?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.1.3' href='#pts-cs18.1.3'>PTS cs 18.1.3</a>Moreover, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, I was once staying at Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga <a class='pc' id='pc324' href='#pc324'></a>Wood by the King's-Sāl Tree … I was once staying at Uruvelā by the Goatherds' Banyan before I was super-enlightened … I was once staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Wood at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground … I was once staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Wood, Anāthapiṇḍaka's Park … I was once staying at Vesālī in the Great Wood at the Gable House Hall”?</p>
<p>Surely then the Exalted Buddha lived among men.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Vetulyaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs18.1.4' href='#pts-cs18.1.4'>PTS cs 18.1.4</a>But did not the Exalted One say,</p>
<p>“born in the world, enlightened in the world, live, having overcome the world, undefiled by the world”?</p>
<p>Hence it is surely not right to say “The Exalted Buddha lived in the world of mankind”.</p>
