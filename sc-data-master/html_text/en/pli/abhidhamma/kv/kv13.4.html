<h1>13.4 Of One whose Salvation is Morally Certain<br>
(<i>niyata</i>)</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That one who is morally certain of salvation has entered the Path of Assurance.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc276' href='#pc276'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.4.1' href='#pts-cs13.4.1'>PTS cs 13.4.1</a>Do you imply that the so-called “Assured” enters upon the True Path of Assurance when assured of immediate retribution, and upon the False Path of Assurance when assured of final salvation? That having first practised the Path, he afterwards enters upon the Assurance; that having first practised the Stream-Winner's Path, he afterwards enters upon the Assurance of the Stream-Winner, and so on … That finally, entrance upon Assurance comes after practise of the applications in mindfulness and the rest of the Factors of Enlightenment?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya, Aparaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.4.2' href='#pts-cs13.4.2'>PTS cs 13.4.2</a>But in contradicting us, you imply that the Bodhisat was not fitted by that last birth to penetrate the Truths.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Nay, I say not so.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya, Aparaseliya:</span> Then he was <span class='add'>already</span> assured of entering upon the Path of Assurance.</p>
