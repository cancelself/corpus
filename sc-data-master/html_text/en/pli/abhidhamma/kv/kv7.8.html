<h1>7.8 Of Decay and Death and <i>Karma</i></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That old age and death are a result of action.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.8.1-2' href='#pts-cs7.8.1-2'>PTS cs 7.8.1–2</a><span class='pe'><em>The first two sections are verbatim as in the preceding discourse, save that instead of</em> “result of action” (<i>kamma-vipāka</i>), “result” (<i>vipāka</i>) <em>only is used</em>.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.8.3' href='#pts-cs7.8.3'>PTS cs 7.8.3</a>Again, you admit, do you not, that the decay and dying of bad states of mind is the result of previous bad states? But then you must also admit that the decay and dying of good states of mind is the result of previous good <a class='pc' id='pc208' href='#pc208'></a> states—which you deny … But in denying the latter, you imply denial of the former statement … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.8.4' href='#pts-cs7.8.4'>PTS cs 7.8.4</a>Or do you hold that the decay and dying of good states of mind is the result of previous bad states? You do, you say. Then you imply that the decay and dying of bad states is the result of previous good states—which you deny … But in denying this, you imply denial of the former statement … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.8.5' href='#pts-cs7.8.5'>PTS cs 7.8.5</a>Or do you affirm that the decay and dying of both good and bad states of mind are the result of bad states? You do, you say. Then you must say no less: “is the result of good states”—which you deny … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.8.6' href='#pts-cs7.8.6'>PTS cs 7.8.6</a>You say my proposition is false. But surely acts conduce to the deterioration and to the curtailment of life? If so, my proposition is true.</p>
