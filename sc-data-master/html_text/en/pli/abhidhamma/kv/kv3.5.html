<h1>3.5 Of the Eighth Man</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That for the person in the Eighth Stage, outbursts of wrong views and of doubt are put away.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.5.1' href='#pts-cs3.5.1'>PTS cs 3.5.1</a>Are you then also prepared to admit that the eighth man is a Stream-Winner, one who has won, obtained, arrived at, and realized the Fruit of Stream-Winning, and that, having achieved, he lives in personal contact therewith?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.5.2-3' href='#pts-cs3.5.2-3'>PTS cs 3.5.2–3</a>Are you further prepared to admit that he has put away the latent bias of doubt and wrong views? And if these, then also the infection of mere rule and ritual? For your proposition involves all this. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.5.4' href='#pts-cs3.5.4'>PTS cs 3.5.4</a> Conversely, if you deny that these are put away by him, you must also deny that he has put away wrong views and doubt.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.5.5' href='#pts-cs3.5.5'>PTS cs 3.5.5</a>How should he have already put away wrong views and doubt when he has not yet practised the Path wherein they get put away? And not only the Path (the Eightfold), but all the other factors of Enlightenment?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.5.6' href='#pts-cs3.5.6'>PTS cs 3.5.6</a>For if he have not put away wrong views and doubt by the Path, or the other factors, he can surely not have put them away by means that is not the Path, but is worldly, co-intoxicant, etc.… and corrupt.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Sammitiya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.5.7-8' href='#pts-cs3.5.7-8'>PTS cs 3.5.7–8</a>Since you deny that a person of the eighth rank has put away the <span class='add'>overt</span> outburst of wrong views and of doubt, I ask you, will these arise any more in him?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> They will not.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Sammitiya:</span> Surely then our proposition is true: they are put away.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.5.9-10' href='#pts-cs3.5.9-10'>PTS cs 3.5.9–10</a>Assuming that the outbursts will not again arise <span class='add'>i.e., become manifest in action</span>, you say they are put away. But is the latent bias of wrong opinions, doubt, and belief in mere rule and ritual equally put away simply because these do not arise? And this you are not prepared to admit.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs3.5.11' href='#pts-cs3.5.11'>PTS cs 3.5.11</a>Once more, you claim that the eighth man has put away wrong views and doubt. But you must then allow <a class='pc' id='pc148' href='#pc148'></a> that one who has reached the stage in <i>Jhāna</i>-meditation of “adoption” has put them away, and in this you do not concur.</p>
