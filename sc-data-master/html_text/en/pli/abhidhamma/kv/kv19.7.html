<h1>19.7 Of Assurance which is not Final</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc340' href='#pc340'></a>: That the average man may possess final assurance.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.7.1' href='#pts-cs19.7.1'>PTS cs 19.7.1</a>Do you mean that he has that assurance even if he commit the worst crimes—matricide, parricide, Arahanticide, wounding a Buddha, breaking up the Order? “Nay”, you say.</p>
<p>Again, could an average man holding that assurance feel doubt about it? “Yes”, you say. Then he cannot feel assured.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.7.2' href='#pts-cs19.7.2'>PTS cs 19.7.2</a>Surely you agree that, if he feel assured, he cannot feel doubt. Now has he put away doubt? “No”, you say. But think! You now assent. Then has he put away doubt by the First Path? or the Second, Third, or Fourth Path? How, then?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> By a bad path.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <span class='add'>Do you tell me that</span> a bad path leads aright, goes to the destruction <span class='add'>of lust, hate, etc.</span>, goes to enlightenment, is immune from intoxicants, is undefiled? Is it not the opposite of all this? … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.7.3' href='#pts-cs19.7.3'>PTS cs 19.7.3</a>Could the Annihilationist view be adopted by a person assured and convinced of the truth of the Eternalist <a class='pc' id='pc341' href='#pc341'></a> view? “Yes”, you say. Surely then the assurance of the average man in his Annihilationist convictions is no “infinite assurance”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.7.4' href='#pts-cs19.7.4'>PTS cs 19.7.4</a>If you now deny in reply to my question, I ask again, has he put away <span class='add'>the Annihilationist view</span>? If so, by which of the Four Paths? You reply, as before, “By a bad path”. That is to say, by a bad path he puts away a bad view … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.7.5-6' href='#pts-cs19.7.5-6'>PTS cs 19.7.5–6</a>A similar argument may be put forward for an Annhilationist who adopts the Eternalist view.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.7.7' href='#pts-cs19.7.7'>PTS cs 19.7.7</a>If I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Take the case, <i>bhikkhus</i>, of a person whose mental states are entirely black-hearted and immoral—he it is who, once immersed, is so once for all”?</p>
<p>Surely then any average man can attain infinite assurance.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.7.8' href='#pts-cs19.7.8'>PTS cs 19.7.8</a>Is that which you have quoted your reason for maintaining your proposition? You admit it is. Now the Exalted One said further:</p>
<p>“Take the case, <i>bhikkhus</i>, of a person who, having come to the surface, is immersed.”</p>
<p>Now is this <span class='add'>supposed to be</span> happening all the time? Of course not …<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.7.9' href='#pts-cs19.7.9'>PTS cs 19.7.9</a> But again he said:</p>
<p>“Take the case, <i>bhikkhus</i>, of a person who, having emerged, so <span class='add'>remains</span>; of one who, having emerged, discerns, glances around; of one who, having emerged, swims across; of one who, having emerged, wins a footing on the shore.”</p>
<p>Now is each of these persons doing so all the time?</p>
<p>And does any of these cases furnish you with a reason for saying that any average person can have final assurance <span class='add'>in his convictions</span>?</p>
