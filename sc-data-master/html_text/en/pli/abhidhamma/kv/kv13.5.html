<h1>13.5 Of One in the Toils</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That a Hindrance is cast off by one who is entangled in it.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.5.1' href='#pts-cs13.5.1'>PTS cs 13.5.1</a>Equally then he who is infatuated abandons lust; he who is malign, stupid, corrupt, abandons hate, dullness, corruptions, respectively. Now, does he cast off lust by lust, hate by hate, and so on?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka: If this is not so, you are suggesting that the Hindrances are cast out by the Path.</span> Now you allow that lust, for instance, and the Path are both conscious experiences. But do you not hereby imply a combination of two rival mental procedures? Lust is immoral, the Path is moral—does not your position imply that good and bad, moral and immoral, radiant and sinister mental states <a class='pc' id='pc277' href='#pc277'></a> confront each other in the mind? And was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“These four things are very far apart: the sky and the earth, the hither and the yonder shore of the ocean, whence the sun rises and where he sinks … Hence far is norm of good from that of evil”?</p>
<p>Hence it is also wrong to say good and bad states confront each other in the mind at the same moment.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.5.2' href='#pts-cs13.5.2'>PTS cs 13.5.2</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“With consciousness thus concentrated, made pure, translucent, cleared, void of defilement, made supple, wieldy, firm, imperturbable, he applies and bends over the mind to insight into the destruction of Intoxicants”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs13.5.3' href='#pts-cs13.5.3'>PTS cs 13.5.3</a>But was it not also said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“He thus knowing, thus seeing, his heart is set free from the Intoxicants—sense-desires, lust of becoming, error and nescience”?</p>
<p>Hence surely it is one who is entangled by the Hindrances who casts them off.</p>
