<h1>7.5 Of Utility</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That merit increases with utility.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.5.1' href='#pts-cs7.5.1'>PTS cs 7.5.1</a><a class='pc' id='pc201' href='#pc201'></a>By your thesis you imply <span class='add'>that other mental experiences are increasing quantities:</span> that contact, feeling, perception, volition, cognition, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, understanding, can each keep growing—which you deny … And that merit keeps growing just as a creeper, a liana, a tree, grass, or brushwood grows—which you deny … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.5.2' href='#pts-cs7.5.2'>PTS cs 7.5.2</a>Again, in affirming it, do you also admit that a giver acquires merit when, having given his gift, he does not consider it further? You do. But this is to imply, in other words, that merit accrues to one who does not consciously advert to, reflect upon, consider, attend to, deliberate, anticipate, aim. Is not the opposite the case? You assent. Then it is wrong to say that merit goes on growing with utility.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.5.3' href='#pts-cs7.5.3'>PTS cs 7.5.3</a>Again, in affirming your thesis, do you also admit that a giver may acquire merit who, on giving a gift, entertains sensual, malevolent, or cruel thoughts? “Yes”, you reply. Then have we here a combination of two contacts, feelings, perceptions, volitions, cognitions? No? Think! “Yes”, you now reply. Then you are maintaining that good and bad, guilty and innocent, base and noble, sinister and clear mental states, can co-exist side by side <span class='add'>at the same moment</span>. You deny. Think again! “Yes”, you now reply. But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“There are four things, <i>bhikkhus</i>, very far away one<a class='pc' id='pc202' href='#pc202'></a> from the other. What are the four? The sky and the earth, the hither and the yonder shore of the ocean, whence the sun rises and where he sinks, the Norm of the good and that of the wicked.</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>”Far is the sky and far from it the earth lies;<br>
Far too the further shore of ocean, say they;<br>
And whence the radiant sun at day-dawn rises,<br>
And where he goes, lightmaker, to his ending.<br>
Yet further than all these asunder, say they,<br>
The Norm of good men's lives and that of bad men.<br>
Co-operation of the good can never perish,<br>
True to its nature while it yet endureth.<br>
But swift dissolves the intercourse of bad men.<br>
Hence far is Norm of good from that of evil”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore it is wrong to say that good and bad, etc., mental states, co-exist side by side in anyone.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika, Siddhatthika, Sammitiya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.5.4' href='#pts-cs7.5.4'>PTS cs 7.5.4</a>But, if your rejection is right, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Planters of groves and shady woods,<br>
And they who build causeway and bridge,<br>
And wells construct and watering-sheds,<br>
And to the homeless dwellings give:<br>
Of such as these by day and night<br>
For ever doth the merit grow.<br>
In righteousness and virtue's might<br>
Such folk from earth to heaven go”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore merit goes on growing with utility.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.5.5' href='#pts-cs7.5.5'>PTS cs 7.5.5</a>Again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, there are these four streams of merit and of good, sources of happiness and blissful fate, resulting in happiness, conducive to heavenly life, conducive to that which is desirable, agreeable, and sweet, to welfare and happiness. What are the four? When a <i>bhikkhu</i>, enjoying the use of robes, or of alms-food, or of shelter, or of medical requisites <a class='pc' id='pc203' href='#pc203'></a> given him, is able to attain to and dwell in infinite concentration of mind, to the giver each of these four gifts is an infinite stream of merit and of good”?</p>
<p>Therefore merit goes on growing with utility.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.5.6' href='#pts-cs7.5.6'>PTS cs 7.5.6</a>You still affirm your proposition. Now, does a giver who has given a gift acquire merit when the acceptor, having accepted the gift, throws it away, abandons it? “Yes”, you reply. But you cannot possibly say of that giver's merit that it goes on growing.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.5.7' href='#pts-cs7.5.7'>PTS cs 7.5.7</a>Or if, when the gift is accepted, kings, or thieves, take it away again, or fire burns it, or water bears it away, or hostile heirs take it back? The same holds good. Hence merit is not dependent upon utility.</p>
