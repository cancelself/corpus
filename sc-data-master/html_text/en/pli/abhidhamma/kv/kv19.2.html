<h1>19.2 Of the Void</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That “the Void” is included in the aggregate of mental coefficients (<i>sankhārakkhandha</i>).</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.2.1' href='#pts-cs19.2.1'>PTS cs 19.2.1</a>Do you then imply that the “Signless”, that the “Not-hankered-after” is also so included? If not, “the <a class='pc' id='pc336' href='#pc336'></a> Void” cannot be, <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.2.2' href='#pts-cs19.2.2'>PTS cs 19.2.2</a> for you cannot predicate of the last that which you deny of the former two.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.2.3' href='#pts-cs19.2.3'>PTS cs 19.2.3</a>Again, if the fourth aggregate be made to include “the Void”, it must be not impermanent, not arisen through a cause, not liable to perish, nor to lose lust, nor to cease, nor to change!</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.2.4' href='#pts-cs19.2.4'>PTS cs 19.2.4</a>Moreover, is the “emptiness” of the material aggregate included under the fourth aggregate? Or the “emptiness” of the second, third, and fifth aggregates thereunder? Or is the “emptiness” of the fourth aggregate itself included under any of the other four? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs19.2.5' href='#pts-cs19.2.5'>PTS cs 19.2.5</a> If the one inclusion is wrong, so are all the other inclusions.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Empty is this, <i>bhikkhus</i>—the <i>sankhāra's</i>—either of soul or of what belongs to soul”?</p>
