<h1>17.9 Of the Order and the Fruit of Giving</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc320' href='#pc320'></a>: That it should not be said that “a thing given to the Order brings great reward”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>The reason and the adherents as above.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.9.1-2' href='#pts-cs17.9.1-2'>PTS cs 17.9.1–2</a><span class='pe'><em>Similar to <a class='cr' href='/kv17.6/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs17.6.1'>Kv 17.6 PTS CS 17.6.1</a>.</em></span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.9.3' href='#pts-cs17.9.3'>PTS cs 17.9.3</a>And was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Give, lady of the Gotamas, to the Order. In that giving thou shalt also render honour to me and to the Order”?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.9.4' href='#pts-cs17.9.4'>PTS cs 17.9.4</a>Again, was it not said to the Exalted One by Sakka, ruler of the gods:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Of men who bring their offerings,<br>
Of creatures who for merit seek,<br>
Makers of merit for fair doom:<br>
Where must they give to reap reward?</p>
<p>The four who practise in the Paths,<br>
The four established in the Fruits:<br>
Such is the Order upright, true,<br>
By wisdom and by virtue stayed.<br>
Of men who bring their offerings,<br>
Of creatures who for merit seek.<br>
Makers of merit for fair doom,<br>
Who to the Order make their gift:<br>
Theirs is't to reap a rich reward”.</p>
<p>“This Order sooth abounds and is grown great.<br>
In measure as the waters of the sea,<br>
These be the valiant students, best of men,<br>
Light-bringers they who do the Norm proclaim.<br>
They who because of them do give their gifts,<br>
Oblations fair, and seemly sacrifice,<br>
They to the Order loyal, firm in faith,<br>
Commended by the wise, win great reward.<br>
And mindful thenceforth of the offerings made,<br>
Joy is their heritage while in this world.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Thereafter,</span> <a class='pc' id='pc321' href='#pc321'></a>conquerors of selfishness<br>
And of the root thereof, free from all blame,<br>
Lo! to a brighter world they win their way?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence surely a thing given to the Order brings great reward.</p>
