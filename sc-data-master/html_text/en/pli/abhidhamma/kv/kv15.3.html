<h1>15.3 Of Duration</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That duration is predetermined.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.3.1' href='#pts-cs15.3.1'>PTS cs 15.3.1</a>Then must duration be one of the five aggregates, which of course it is not. This holds good whether you take past, <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.3.2' href='#pts-cs15.3.2'>PTS cs 15.3.2</a> future, or present duration. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.3.3' href='#pts-cs15.3.3'>PTS cs 15.3.3</a> Now, you say that any past aggregate, bodily or mental, constitutes past duration; any future, any present aggregate, future or present duration respectively. Then are there five past durations, five future, five present durations? …<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.3.4' href='#pts-cs15.3.4'>PTS cs 15.3.4</a> fifteen durations in all? Or, if they are regarded as twelve past, future, present organs-and-objects-of-sense, are there thirty-six durations in all? … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.3.5' href='#pts-cs15.3.5'>PTS cs 15.3.5</a>Or if we consider them as eighteen elements, are there fifty-four durations? or as controlling powers, are there sixty-six durations?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Opponent:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.3.6' href='#pts-cs15.3.6'>PTS cs 15.3.6</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“There are these three subjects of discourse, <i>bhikkhus</i>—which are the three? One may talk about past time: `Thus was it in times past'. Or about future time: `Thus will it be in future times'. Or about the present: `Thus is it now at present”'?</p>
<p>Hence surely duration is predetermined?</p>
