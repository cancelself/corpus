<h1>9.11 Of Past, Future, and Present</h1>

<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc242' href='#pc242'></a>: That a past or future experience is actually possessed.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.11.1' href='#pts-cs9.11.1'>PTS cs 9.11.1</a>But is not the past extinct, departed, changed, come to an end, finished? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.11.2' href='#pts-cs9.11.2'>PTS cs 9.11.2</a> And is not the future unborn, not yet become, not come into being, not produced, not brought to pass, not manifested? How then can you call either something that is actually possessed?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.11.3' href='#pts-cs9.11.3'>PTS cs 9.11.3</a>Is one who possesses a present material or bodily aggregate also in possession of a past and a future bodily aggregate? Then must you admit three bodily aggregates. Similarly, if he is actually in possession of five past and five future, as well as five present <span class='add'>bodily and mental</span> aggregates, you must admit fifteen aggregates … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.11.4-6' href='#pts-cs9.11.4-6'>PTS cs 9.11.4–6</a>A similar argument applies to the organs and objects of sense, to the eighteen elements, to the twenty-two controlling powers.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.11.7' href='#pts-cs9.11.7'>PTS cs 9.11.7</a>But are there not those who, meditating on the eight stages of emancipation, can induce the four <i>Jhāna</i>s at their pleasure, can acquire the four serial grades? Surely then it is right to say that one can have actual present possession of past and future things?</p>
