<h1>7.10 Of Results as again causing Results</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That “result” is itself a state entailing resultant states.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc210' href='#pc210'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.10.1' href='#pts-cs7.10.1'>PTS cs 7.10.1</a>If your proposition is true it is tantamount to saying that the result of <span class='add'>that</span> <span class='add'>result</span> entails <span class='add'>other</span> results—which you deny … Or, if you assent, then you are asserting that in a given series there is no making an end of ill, no cutting off the round of birth and death, no <i>Nibbāna</i> without residual stuff of life—which is contrary to doctrine.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.10.2' href='#pts-cs7.10.2'>PTS cs 7.10.2</a>Again, are you asserting that “result” and “state entailing resultant states” are identical, equivalent terms—of one import, the same, of the same content and origin?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.10.3' href='#pts-cs7.10.3'>PTS cs 7.10.3</a>That they are concomitant, co-existent, conjoined, connected, one in genesis, in cessation, in basis, and in mental object? All this you deny …</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.10.4' href='#pts-cs7.10.4'>PTS cs 7.10.4</a>Again, do you mean that a given bad mental state is its own result, a given good state its own result? That the consciousness with which we take life is the very consciousness with which we burn in purgatory? That the consciousness with which we give a gift of merit is the very consciousness with which we rejoice in heaven? … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.10.5' href='#pts-cs7.10.5'>PTS cs 7.10.5</a>You deny my proposition; but are not “results <span class='add'>of <i>karma</i></span>” the four immaterial aggregates in reciprocal relation? If so, surely it is right to say that a result is a mental state resulting from other mental states?</p>
