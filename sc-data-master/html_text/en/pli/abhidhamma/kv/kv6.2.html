<h1>6.2 Of Causal Genesis</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the causal elements in the law of causal genesis are unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.2.1' href='#pts-cs6.2.1'>PTS cs 6.2.1</a>This is exactly similar to the opening argument in <a class='cr' href='/kv6.1/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs6.1.1'>Kv 6.1 PTS CS 6.1.1</a>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc187' href='#pc187'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.2.2-3' href='#pts-cs6.2.2-3'>PTS cs 6.2.2–3</a>Would you say that any single term in each clause of the formula of causal genesis refers to something unconditioned, for instance, “ignorance”, or “<i>karma</i>”, in the clause “because of ignorance, <i>karma</i>”, etc.? No? Then how can you maintain your thesis?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.2.4' href='#pts-cs6.2.4'>PTS cs 6.2.4</a><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya, Mahiṁsāsaka:</span> If we are wrong, why did the Exalted One say as follows:</p>
<p>“`Because of birth, <i>bhikkhus</i>, comes decay and death'; whether Tathāgatas arise or not, this element stands as the establishing of things as effects, as the marking out of things as effects, as the cause of this or that. Concerning this element a Tathāgata becomes enlightened, and penetrates it. Thus enlightened and penetrating, he declares, teaches, makes known, lays it down, reveals, dispenses, makes manifest, and behold! he saith: `Because of birth, <i>bhikkhus</i>, comes decay and death'. `Because of the tendency to become comes birth. Because of … and so on, back to'. `Because of ignorance comes <i>karma</i>'. Thus, <i>bhikkhus</i>, this element, stable, constant, immutable, is called a causal term <span class='add'>in the law of causal genesis</span>”?</p>
<p>Surely then the causal element in that law is unconditioned.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.2.5' href='#pts-cs6.2.5'>PTS cs 6.2.5</a>In the clause “Because of ignorance <i>karma</i>”, the former is that which establishes, which marks out the latter as its effect. And <i>Nibbāna</i> is unconditioned—you affirm both of these? Yes? Then are there two unconditioneds? … two shelters … (as in <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs6.2.1'>PTS CS 6.2.1</a>)?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.2.6' href='#pts-cs6.2.6'>PTS cs 6.2.6</a>And if in the next clause: “Because of <i>karma</i>, con<a class='pc' id='pc188' href='#pc188'></a>sciousness”, you affirm that <i>karma</i> is unconditioned, are there then three unconditioneds? … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.2.7' href='#pts-cs6.2.7'>PTS cs 6.2.7</a>And so on, affirming that each of the remaining nine terms and <i>Nibbāna</i> are unconditioned: are there then twelve unconditioneds? … twelve shelters, twelve refuges, etc.?</p>
<p>Of course you deny, hence you cannot affirm that the causal term in the law of causal genesis is unconditioned.</p>
