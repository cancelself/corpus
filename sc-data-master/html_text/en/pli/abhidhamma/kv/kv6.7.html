<h1>6.7 Of Space as visible</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc193' href='#pc193'></a>: That space is visible.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.7.1' href='#pts-cs6.7.1'>PTS cs 6.7.1</a>If this is so, you commit yourself to saying that space is visible material, visible object and element, and therefore, as such, is either blue-green, yellow, red, or white, is cognizable by the eye, impinges on the eye or organ of vision, enters into the avenue of sight—which you deny … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.7.2' href='#pts-cs6.7.2'>PTS cs 6.7.2</a>Substituting “space” for “visible object”, you must affirm or deny that “because of eye and space visual consciousness arises”. If <em>not</em>, your proposition falls through. If you agree, you cannot quote any Suttanta to establish this. All that the Suttanta says is:</p>
<p>“Because of eye and visible object visual consciousness arises”.</p>
<p>as you agree. Hence you must either call space visible object (with its properties), or fail to maintain your position.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.7.3' href='#pts-cs6.7.3'>PTS cs 6.7.3</a>If I am wrong, you must nevertheless admit that you “see” the interval between two trees or two posts, the space in a keyhole or in a window. Surely then space is visible.</p>
