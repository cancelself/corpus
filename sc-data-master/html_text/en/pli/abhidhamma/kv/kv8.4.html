<h1>8.4 Of Sense-Desires</h1>

<p><a class='pc' id='pc215' href='#pc215'></a></p>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: Whether the subjective sense-desires or the objective five fields of sense constitute kāma's?</p>
<p>This <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.4.1' href='#pts-cs8.4.1'>PTS cs 8.4.1</a> paragraph is <em>verbatim</em> = <a class='cr' href='/kv8.3/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs8.3.1'>Kv 8.3 PTS CS 8.3.1</a>, and <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.4.2' href='#pts-cs8.4.2'>PTS cs 8.4.2</a> is <em>verbatim</em> = <a class='cr' href='/kv8.3/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs8.3.5'>Kv 8.3 PTS CS 8.3.5</a>, save for the substitution of “Hence sensuality consists in only the five fields of sense-object”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.4.3' href='#pts-cs8.4.3'>PTS cs 8.4.3</a>But was it not also said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“There are these fivefold pleasures of sense, <i>bhikkhus</i>: which are the five? Objects desirable,… adapted to sense-desires <i>(kāma)</i>, and seductive are cognizable by sight, hearing, etc.… five kinds of <span class='add'>objects associated with</span> sense-pleasure. Nevertheless, <i>bhikkhus</i>, these are not sense-desires; they are called in the Ariyan discipline <span class='add'>objects of</span> sense-pleasures <i>(kāmaguṇā)</i>. For <i>kāma</i> is a man's lustful intention”;</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“The manifold of objects in the world—<br>
This in itself is not `desires of sense.’<br>
Lustful intention is man's sense-desires.<br>
That manifold of objects doth endure;<br>
The will thereto the wise exterminate”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence it is wrong to say that just the five kinds of sense-objects constitute sense-desires.</p>
