<h1>8.5 Of the Rūpa-Element</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc217' href='#pc217'></a>: That the ultimate “datum or element of <i>rūpa</i>” is things <span class='add'>cognized as</span> material.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.5.1' href='#pts-cs8.5.1'>PTS cs 8.5.1</a>Is then <i>rūpa</i> a sphere of life, a destiny, a realm of beings, renewed life, a matrix, a station for rebirth-consciousness, an acquiring of individuality? Is there <i>karma</i> leading to it, beings to be reborn in it? Do they get born, grow old, die, decease, get rebirth there? Are the five aggregates “in” <i>rūpa</i>? Is it a five-mode existence? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.5.2' href='#pts-cs8.5.2'>PTS cs 8.5.2</a> Now all these you can predicate of the <i>Rūpa</i>-datum, but not of <i>rūpa</i>, or material quality. Hence the latter has not all that is implicated in the former.</p>
<p>Again, if the <i>Rūpa</i>-datum consists only of material qualities—and, as you will admit, there is material quality in the <i>Kāma</i>-datum—is this latter datum the same as <i>Rūpa</i>-datum? You say “no”. But think. <em>You</em> must admit it is. Then we get a man in two life-spheres at the same time … .</p>
