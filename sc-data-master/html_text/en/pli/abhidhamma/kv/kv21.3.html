<h1>21.3 Of Certain Fetters</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That Arahantship is won without a certain “Fetter”-quantity being cast off.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc353' href='#pc353'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21.3.1' href='#pts-cs21.3.1'>PTS cs 21.3.1</a>Do you imply that Arahantship is won without the extirpation of theory of soul, or doubt, or contagion of mere rule and ritual, or lust, or hate, or dullness, or indiscretion? You deny that you do, but your proposition cannot then be maintained.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21.3.2' href='#pts-cs21.3.2'>PTS cs 21.3.2</a>Or do you imply that the Arahant is prone to lust, hate, dullness, conceit, pride, despair, corruption? Is not the opposite true of him? How then can you say there are certain Fetters he has not cast off?</p>
