<h1>16.10 Of Desire for Life in the Higher Heavens</h1>
</header>
<p>Controverted Point: That lust for life in Rūpa or Arūpa spheres is included among the data thereof.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.10.1' href='#pts-cs16.10.1'>PTS cs 16.10.1</a><span class='pe'><em>Similar to <a class='cr' href='/kv16.9/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs16.9.1'>Kv 16.9 PTS CS 16.9.1</a>.</em></span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.10.2' href='#pts-cs16.10.2'>PTS cs 16.10.2</a>And you cannot maintain your view without admitting that a corresponding lust for the objects of hearing, smell<a class='pc' id='pc311' href='#pc311'></a>ing, taste and touch is one of the data in the sphere of each of these respectively.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.10.3' href='#pts-cs16.10.3'>PTS cs 16.10.3</a>If you cannot affirm the latter, you cannot make an exception of the former.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.10.4' href='#pts-cs16.10.4'>PTS cs 16.10.4</a>Next with regard to (ii.) lust for life on the Arūpa <span class='add'>immaterial</span> plane as a datum thereof—my first argument used above (<a class='cr' href='/kv16.9/en/aung-rhysdavids'>Kv 16.9</a>) holds good. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.10.5-6' href='#pts-cs16.10.5-6'>PTS cs 16.10.5–6</a>. So does my second used above (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs16.10.2'>PTS CS 16.10.2</a>). If your proposition is to stand, then a desire for each sense-object must be among the elemental data of the sphere of that particular object. You cannot make an exception of the desire for life in the immaterial sphere.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.10.7' href='#pts-cs16.10.7'>PTS cs 16.10.7</a>But is not desire for life in the plane of sense <span class='add'><i>kāmadhātu</i></span> among the elemental data of that plane? Then surely you cannot make an exception as to desire for life in the Rūpa and Arūpa spheres?</p>
