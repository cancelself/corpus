<h1>8.8 Of Matter in Arūpa-Sphere</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc220' href='#pc220'></a>: That there is matter among the Immaterials.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.8.1' href='#pts-cs8.8.1'>PTS cs 8.8.1</a>Is then “matter” (<i>rūpa</i>) a sphere of life, a destiny, a realm of beings, renewed life, a matrix, an acquiring of individuality? This you deny; but all this you can predicate truly of Arūpa. Hence you cannot maintain your proposition.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.8.2' href='#pts-cs8.8.2'>PTS cs 8.8.2</a>You cannot predicate them truly of a five-mode existence, one mode of which is material qualities. But you can do so respecting a four-mode existence, that is, with the material qualities omitted, as is the case with Arūpa … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.8.3' href='#pts-cs8.8.3'>PTS cs 8.8.3</a>You can predicate them truly of the Rūpa-sphere, where there yet is matter. But this sphere is not identical with the Arūpa-sphere. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.8.4' href='#pts-cs8.8.4'>PTS cs 8.8.4</a> And if you predicate matter of the Arūpa-sphere, you must show that matter agrees with the description you can truly give of the Arūpa-sphere as a state of existence, a destiny, etc.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.8.5' href='#pts-cs8.8.5'>PTS cs 8.8.5</a>Again, did not the Exalted One say that the Arūpa was a way of escape from visible or material things? If that is true, do you still maintain your proposition? Yes? Well, then, the Exalted One said that renunciation was a way of escape from sense-desires. Now, according to your reasoning (if there is matter in the Immaterial), there are sense-desires in renunciation, and there are intoxicants in <a class='pc' id='pc221' href='#pc221'></a> those who are freed from them, there are things “included” (in intoxicant-infested states of the three spheres) among the “unincluded” which is absurd.</p>
