<h1>9.6 Of Past Ideas</h1>

<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That consciousness of a past object is without object.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.6.1' href='#pts-cs9.6.1'>PTS cs 9.6.1</a>But you admit that there is such a thing as a mental object that is past? Then how can you make such a self-contradictory statement? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.6.2' href='#pts-cs9.6.2'>PTS cs 9.6.2</a> Again, is there not adverting of mind, ideation, co-ordinated application, attention, volition, anticipation, aim, concerning that which is past? … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That a consciousness, having an idea that is future, is without object.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.6.3-4' href='#pts-cs9.6.3-4'>PTS cs 9.6.3–4</a><span class='pe'><em>These paragraphs are verbatim as in <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs9.6.1'>PTS CS 9.6.1</a> and <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs9.6.2'>PTS CS 9.6.2</a></em>, “future” <em>substituted for</em> “past”.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc238' href='#pc238'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.6.5' href='#pts-cs9.6.5'>PTS cs 9.6.5</a>continues: You admit of course concerning what is present, that there can be adverting of mind, ideation, and so on (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs9.6.2'>PTS CS 9.6.2</a>), so that consciousness of a present idea has its mental object. And you admit that there can be adverting of mind and the rest about the past and also about the future. Yet in both these cases mind, you say, is without mental object. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.6.6' href='#pts-cs9.6.6'>PTS cs 9.6.6</a> Why not also say then that, while there can be adverting of mind, etc., about the present, mind occupied about a present object is mind without object?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.6.7' href='#pts-cs9.6.7'>PTS cs 9.6.7</a>But you admit that a “past object” does not exist <span class='add'>at the present moment</span>? Surely then a mind occupied with past object is occupied with no (that is, with a non-existent) object … .</p>

<p><cite class='book' translate='no'>The Points of Controversy</cite>, an English translation of the Pali Abhidhamma Kathāvatthu. Translated by <span class='author'>Shwe Zan Aung</span> and <span class='author'>C.A.F. Rhys Davids</span>. First published by Pali Text Society, <span class='publication-date'>1915</span>.</p>
<p>This SuttaCentral edition was prepared by <span class='editor'>Manfred Wierich</span> and <span class='editor'>Ven. Vimala</span> and proofread by <span class='editor'>Josephine Tobin</span>. Some changes were introduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbreviations, i.e., those of cited works and the participants in the controversies, were expanded.</li>
<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
<li>Letter-spacing with fixed spaces was replaced with bold font.</li>
<li>The corrigenda were merged into the text. Some could not be resolved, though.</li>

<p>Note by Bhante Sujato: In the original English translation, the second part from PTS CS 9.6.3 onwards was in a separate section, Kv.9.7. This appears to be a mistake, and I have followed the Mahāsaṅgīti edition in combining these. This means that all subsequent sections in this vagga are numbered one less than the original.</p>
