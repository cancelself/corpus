<h1>8.1 Of Divers Destinies</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc211' href='#pc211'></a>: That there are six spheres of destiny.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.1.1' href='#pts-cs8.1.1'>PTS cs 8.1.1</a>Did not the Exalted One name five destinies—purgatory, the animal kingdom, the Peta-realm, mankind, the devas? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.1.2' href='#pts-cs8.1.2'>PTS cs 8.1.2</a> And did not the Kālakañjaka Asuras, who resembled the Petas in <span class='add'>ugly or frightful</span> shape, sex-life, diet, and length of life, intermarry with them? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.1.3' href='#pts-cs8.1.3'>PTS cs 8.1.3</a> And did not Vepacitti's troop, who in the same respects resembled the devas, intermarry with devas? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.1.4' href='#pts-cs8.1.4'>PTS cs 8.1.4</a> And had not Vepacitti's troop been formerly devas?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs8.1.5' href='#pts-cs8.1.5'>PTS cs 8.1.5</a>But since there is an Asura-group, it is surely right to speak of it as a <span class='add'>possible</span> destiny?</p>

<ul>
<li>Abbreviations, i.e., those of cited works and the participants in the controversies, were expanded.</li>
<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
<li>Letter-spacing with fixed spaces was replaced with bold font.</li>
<li>The corrigenda were merged into the text. Some could not be resolved, though.</li>
