<h1>6.4 Of the Four Immaterial Spheres <span class='add'>of Life and Thought</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the sphere of infinite space is unconditioned.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.4.1' href='#pts-cs6.4.1'>PTS cs 6.4.1</a>Are you implying that it is in this respect identical with <i>Nibbāna</i>, the Shelter, the Cave, the Refuge, <a class='pc' id='pc190' href='#pc190'></a>the Goal, the Past-Decease, the Ambrosial? You deny … Then you cannot so class it. If you affirm, we may then have two Unconditioneds, two <i>Nibbānas</i> … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.4.2' href='#pts-cs6.4.2'>PTS cs 6.4.2</a>You admit, do you not, that the sphere of infinite space is a form of rebirth, a destination, an abode of beings, a sequel in living, a matrix of birth, a station for reborn consciousness, an acquiring of individuality? Then is the unconditioned to be so described? Of course not … .</p>
<p>Is there <i>karma</i> which brings us to rebirth in that sphere? “Yes”, you say. Then is there <i>karma</i> which brings about rebirth in the unconditioned? Of course you deny … There are beings who for their deserts are reborn in that sphere of infinite space, but are there any who for their deserts are reborn in the unconditioned? Of course you deny … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.4.3' href='#pts-cs6.4.3'>PTS cs 6.4.3</a>Do any beings become born, decay, die, decease, and spring up again in that sphere? Yes? But surely not in the unconditioned … .</p>
<p>Does mind in its four constituents exist in that sphere? Yes? But hardly in the unconditioned … You cannot call the latter a plane of life with four constituents, as is the former.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Opponent:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.4.4' href='#pts-cs6.4.4'>PTS cs 6.4.4</a>But did not the Exalted One say that the four Immaterial spheres are imperturbable? Surely then we may call them unconditioned.</p>
