<h1>15.2 Of Reciprocal Correlation</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That whereas actions are conditioned by ignorance, we may not say that ignorance is conditioned by actions.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.2.1' href='#pts-cs15.2.1'>PTS cs 15.2.1</a>But is not ignorance coexistent with action? If so, here is a reciprocal correlation <span class='add'>namely, of coexistence.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.2.2' href='#pts-cs15.2.2'>PTS cs 15.2.2</a>Again, “grasping is conditioned by craving”. Now, is it wrong to say that craving is conditioned by grasping? Yes, you say. But the argument above is valid here also.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahāsaṅghika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.2.3' href='#pts-cs15.2.3'>PTS cs 15.2.3</a>“Birth, <i>bhikkhus</i>, is conditioned by decay and death, the tendency to become is conditioned by birth”—is the Suttanta thus?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> No.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahāsaṅghika:</span> Neither is the reciprocal conditioning correlation between ignorance and activities reciprocal, nor that between craving and grasping.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs15.2.4' href='#pts-cs15.2.4'>PTS cs 15.2.4</a>“Mind and body, <i>bhikkhus</i>, are conditioned by rebirth-consciousness, and this by mind and body”—is the Suttanta thus?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahāsaṅghika:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Then the conditioning relation may be reciprocal.</p>
