<h1>9.1 Of Release through seeing the Good</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc230' href='#pc230'></a>: That the Fetters are put off for one who discerns a blessing (in store).</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.1.1' href='#pts-cs9.1.1'>PTS cs 9.1.1</a>But are not the Fetters also put off when the world is considered as impermanent? You admit this, of course. But <span class='add'>then you should not confine yourself to the optimistic side.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.1.2' href='#pts-cs9.1.2'>PTS cs 9.1.2</a>You admit, too, they are put off when the world is considered as full of Ill, as disease, as a canker, a piercing dart, as woe, as unbearable, as an enemy, as crumbling away, as a calamity, as oppression, as peril, as trouble, as fluctuating, as dissolving, as transient, as shelterless, as no retreat, as no refuge, as without protection, as empty, bare and void, as without soul, as full of danger, and mutable. <span class='add'>But your statement hereby becomes one-sided.</span></p>
<p>You<a class='pc' id='pc231' href='#pc231'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.1.3' href='#pts-cs9.1.3'>PTS cs 9.1.3</a> admit then that (at the same moment) a man can both consider the impermanence and so on of the world, and see the blessings in <i>Nibbāna</i>? No? But you have admitted that he loses the Fetters when he does both. You admit then that he can? But does this not involve us in two simultaneous mental reactions, two consciousnesses, and so on?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.1.4' href='#pts-cs9.1.4'>PTS cs 9.1.4</a>You reject my proposition. But did not the Exalted One say:</p>
<p>“Take, <i>bhikkhus</i>, the case of a <i>bhikkhu</i> who lives contemplating the happiness in <i>Nibbāna</i>, perceiving and feeling that happiness continually, constantly, and undiluted, convinced of it in his mind and permeated with it by insight …”?</p>
<p>Surely then it is for one who discerns the happy prospect that the Fetters are put off.</p>
