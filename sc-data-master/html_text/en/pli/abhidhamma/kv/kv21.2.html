<h1>21.2 Of Experience as Inseparable from Personality</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc352' href='#pc352'></a>: That an ordinary person is not exempt from experiencing the phenomena of all the three spheres of life.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21.2.1' href='#pts-cs21.2.1'>PTS cs 21.2.1</a>You imply that an ordinary person is inseparable from the contacts, the feelings, perceptions, volitions, cognitions, faiths, efforts, mindfulnesses, concentrations, understandings, belonging to all three spheres? You deny; but what else can you mean?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21.2.2' href='#pts-cs21.2.2'>PTS cs 21.2.2</a>Again, you imply that when he makes a gift, say, of raiment, etc., at that moment he is enjoying not only the giver's consciousness, but also the Rūpa-consciousness of the Four <i>Jhāna</i>s, the Arūpa-consciousness of the four Arūpa-Jhānas.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Opponent:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21.2.3' href='#pts-cs21.2.3'>PTS cs 21.2.3</a>But is an ordinary person capable of distinguishing whether his actions leading to a Rūpa-world or Arūpa-world? If not, then surely he cannot be separated from actions leading to all three spheres.</p>
