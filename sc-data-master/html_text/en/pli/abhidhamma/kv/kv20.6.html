<h1>20.6 Of Insight</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That insight into the twelve-fold base is spiritual.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.6.1' href='#pts-cs20.6.1'>PTS cs 20.6.1</a>Do you mean that there are twelve kinds of insight? You deny. I ask again. You admit. Then are there twelve <span class='add'>First or</span> Stream-winning Paths? Or Fruits thereof? Or twelve of any of the other Paths or Fruits? …</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.6.2' href='#pts-cs20.6.2'>PTS cs 20.6.2</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“(A, i.) That this Ariyan Truth concerning Ill, O <i>bhikkhus</i>, was not among the doctrines handed down, but there arose in me the vision, there arose in me the insight <i>(ñāṇaṃ)</i>, there arose in me the wisdom, there arose in me the understanding, there arose in me the light; (ii.) that this Ariyan fact of Ill must be comprehended; (iii.) that it was comprehended; (B, i.) that this was the Ariyan Truth concerning the Cause of Ill; (ii.) that the Cause of Ill was to be put away …; (iii.) was put away; (C, i.) that this was the Ariyan Truth concerning the Cessation of Ill; (ii.) that this Cessation was to be realized; (iii.) had been realized; (D, i.) that this was the Ariyan Truth concern<a class='pc' id='pc350' href='#pc350'></a>ing the Path going to the Cessation of Ill; (ii.) that that Path was to be developed; (iii.) that it had been developed”?</p>
<p>Hence surely the insight based on these twelve parts is spiritual.</p>
