<h1>10.4 Of Sensations as Moral and Immoral</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc247' href='#pc247'></a>: That the five kinds of sense-consciousness are good and bad (have positive moral quality).</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.4.1-3' href='#pts-cs10.4.1-3'>PTS cs 10.4.1–3</a><span class='pe'><em>(Verbatim similar to <a class='cr' href='/kv10.3/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs10.3.1'>Kv 10.3 PTS CS 10.3.1</a>–<a class='cr' href='/kv10.3/en/aung-rhysdavids#pts-cs10.3.3'>PTS CS 10.3.3</a>.) The argument being here, too, that the senses are limited to sense-objects, ethical and intellectual matters being the concerns of intellect, will, etc.</em></span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahāsaṅghika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.4.4' href='#pts-cs10.4.4'>PTS cs 10.4.4</a>Well, but was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Here, <i>bhikkhus</i>, when a <i>bhikkhu</i> sees an object with the eye, he grasps,… or again, does not grasp, at the general characters, or the details of it,… or hears a sound, etc. …”?</p>
<p>Surely then the five sorts of sense-consciousness are good and bad.</p>
