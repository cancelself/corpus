<h1>9.4 Of Bias as without Mental Object</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That latent (immoral) bias is without mental object.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.4.1' href='#pts-cs9.4.1'>PTS cs 9.4.1</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Then the forms of latent bias must be either material quality, or <i>Nibbāna</i>, or one of the five organs or five objects of sense, which you deny.</p>
<p>But <a class='pc' id='pc235' href='#pc235'></a> let us take the first form, the bias of sense-desire. If this is without mental object, must you not also affirm the same of all manifestations and notions of sense-desire—to wit, sense-desire as lust, as an outburst of lustful desire, as a Fetter, as a Flood, as a Bond, as an Obstacle? Would you not rather affirm just the opposite of these, that they are concomitant with mental object?</p>
<p>%There is no note 2 on p. 229 in the original text.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.4.2' href='#pts-cs9.4.2'>PTS cs 9.4.2</a>Or again, in what aggregate is latent bias included? The aggregate of mental coefficients, you say. But these are concomitant with object not less than the other mental aggregates: this you of course admit. How then can you maintain your proposition? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.4.3' href='#pts-cs9.4.3'>PTS cs 9.4.3</a> If you affirm that (a) the bias of sense-lust has the aggregate of mental coefficients involved with it, and yet is without mental object, you must say no less of (b) sense-lust in general. But you refuse (making of sense-lust as bias a thing apart).</p>
<p>Thus<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.4.4' href='#pts-cs9.4.4'>PTS cs 9.4.4</a> you get: (a) aggregate of mental coefficients without mental object; (b) aggregate of mental coefficients with mental object.</p>
<p>Then is that aggregate partly with, partly without, mental object? Then must you affirm the same of all the mental aggregates … which you may not … .</p>
<p>Or, <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.4.5' href='#pts-cs9.4.5'>PTS cs 9.4.5</a> passing over the next five latent biases—resentment, conceit, mere opinion, doubt, lust of rebirth—as disposed of by this same argument, take similarly the seventh—nescience—if this as latent bias is without object, it must be no less without mental object when figured as Flood, Bond, Outburst, Fetter, Obstacle—which you deny <span class='add'>keeping the latent bias a thing apart.</span></p>
<p>The<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.4.6-8' href='#pts-cs9.4.6-8'>PTS cs 9.4.6–8</a> argument about the aggregates applies no less to this form of bias.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Uttarāpathaka:</span> But<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.4.9' href='#pts-cs9.4.9'>PTS cs 9.4.9</a> is it not right to say that, when an average man of the world is thinking of something that is morally good or indeterminate, he may be described as <a class='pc' id='pc236' href='#pc236'></a> “having latent bias”? And are not <span class='add'>at that moment</span> those forms of bias <span class='add'>latent in him</span> without mental object?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.4.10' href='#pts-cs9.4.10'>PTS cs 9.4.10</a> you could equally well say of him at such a moment that he had lust in his heart, and you deny that lust is without mental object … .</p>
