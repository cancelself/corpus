<h1>17.2 Of Arahants and Untimely Death</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc313' href='#pc313'></a>: That an Arahant cannot have an untimely death.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.2.1' href='#pts-cs17.2.1'>PTS cs 17.2.1</a>Then are there no murderers of Arahants? You admit there are. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.2.2' href='#pts-cs17.2.2'>PTS cs 17.2.2</a> Now when anyone takes the life of an Arahant, does he take away the remainder of life from a living man, or from one who is not living? If the former, then you cannot maintain your proposition. If the latter, there is no murder, and your admission is wrong.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.2.3' href='#pts-cs17.2.3'>PTS cs 17.2.3</a>Again, you admit that poison, weapons, or fire may get access to the body of an Arahant. It is therefore clear that an Arahant may suffer sudden death. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.2.4' href='#pts-cs17.2.4'>PTS cs 17.2.4</a> But if you deny, then there can be no murderer.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika, Siddhatthika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs17.2.5' href='#pts-cs17.2.5'>PTS cs 17.2.5</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“I declare, <i>bhikkhus</i>, that there cannot be destruction <span class='add'>of <i>karmic</i> energy</span> ere the outcome of deeds that have been deliberately wrought and conserved has been experienced, whether that destruction be under present conditions, or in the next or in a subsequent series of conditions”?</p>
<p>Hence there is no untimely dying for an Arahant.</p>
