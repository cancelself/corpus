<h1>5.5 Of Analytic Insight</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc179' href='#pc179'></a>: That all knowledge is analytic.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.5.1' href='#pts-cs5.5.1'>PTS cs 5.5.1</a>Then you must admit that popular knowledge is analytic—which you deny. For if you assent, then all who have popular, conventional knowledge, have also acquired analytic insight—which you deny. The same argument holds good if “knowledge in discerning the thought of another” be substituted for “popular … knowledge”.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.5.2' href='#pts-cs5.5.2'>PTS cs 5.5.2</a>Again, if all knowledge is analytic, then <i>a fortiori</i> all discernment is analytic. Or, if you can assent to that, you must therewith admit that the discernment of one who attains <i>Jhāna</i> by any of the elemental, or colour “artifices”, who attains any of the four more abstract <i>Jhāna</i>s, who gives donations, who gives to the Order any of the four necessaries of life, is analytic. But this you deny.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> If<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.5.3' href='#pts-cs5.5.3'>PTS cs 5.5.3</a> I am wrong, you admit that there is such a thing as <span class='add'>spiritual or</span> supramundane discernment; is that not analytic?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> That I do not deny</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> Then my proposition is true.</p>
