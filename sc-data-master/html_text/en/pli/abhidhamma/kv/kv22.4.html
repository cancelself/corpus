<h1>22.4 Of Penetrating the Truth</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That an embryo is capable of penetrating the truth.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.4.1' href='#pts-cs22.4.1'>PTS cs 22.4.1</a>You are implying that an embryo can be instructed in, hear, and become familiar with the Doctrine, can be catechized, can take on himself the precepts, be <a class='pc' id='pc361' href='#pc361'></a> guarded as to the gates of sense, abstemious in diet, devoted to vigils early and late. Is not the opposite true?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.4.2' href='#pts-cs22.4.2'>PTS cs 22.4.2</a>Are there not two conditions for the genesis of right views—“another's voice and intelligent attention”?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.4.3' href='#pts-cs22.4.3'>PTS cs 22.4.3</a>And can there be penetration of the Truth by one who is asleep, or languid, or blurred in intelligence, or unreflective?</p>
