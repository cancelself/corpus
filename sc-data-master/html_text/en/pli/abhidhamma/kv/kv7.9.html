<h1>7.9 Of the Ariyan Mind and its Results</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That Ariyan states of mind have no <span class='add'>positive</span> result.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.9.1-3' href='#pts-cs7.9.1-3'>PTS cs 7.9.1–3</a>But you admit that the career of a recluse or religious student is productive of great rewards—to wit, the fruits of the Four Paths. How then can you deny positive result?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.9.3' href='#pts-cs7.9.3'>PTS cs 7.9.3</a>Or, if you deny that these four kinds of fruit are positive result—as you do—then you equally deny that <a class='pc' id='pc209' href='#pc209'></a> there is positive result in the fruit of giving or of moral conduct, or of religious exercises, which you maintain … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.9.4' href='#pts-cs7.9.4'>PTS cs 7.9.4</a>Now in maintaining these propositions, you must no less maintain that there is positive result in the fruits of the Paths … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.9.5' href='#pts-cs7.9.5'>PTS cs 7.9.5</a>Again, you will of course admit that good done in relation to life on earth or in the heavens, material or immaterial, entails result. Does this not commit you to admitting that good done in relation to path-graduating also entails result <span class='add'>though you deny this by your proposition</span>? Conversely, if you maintain that good done in relation to path-graduating entails no result, must you not also deny result to good done in relation to life on earth or in heaven?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.9.6' href='#pts-cs7.9.6'>PTS cs 7.9.6</a> <span class='add'>Well, but is not this a parallel case?</span> You will of course admit that good done in relation to life on earth or in the heavens, material or immaterial, entailing result, makes for accumulation of rebirth. Does this not commit you to admitting that good done in relation to path-graduating, entailing <span class='add'>as you say</span> result, makes also for accumulation of rebirth <span class='add'>though you of course deny this</span>?</p>
