<h1>9.2 Of the Ambrosial as an Object by which we are bound</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the Ambrosial as an object of thought is a “fetter”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc232' href='#pc232'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.2.1' href='#pts-cs9.2.1'>PTS cs 9.2.1</a>If you say that, are you prepared to admit that the Ambrosial is the object of consciousness accompanied by “Fetters”, “Ties”, “Floods”, “Bonds”, “Hindrances”, “Infections”, “Graspings”, “Corruptions”? Is it not rather an object accompanied by the very opposite?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.2.2-4' href='#pts-cs9.2.2-4'>PTS cs 9.2.2–4</a>You affirm that, on account of the Ambrosial occupying the mind, lust, hate, ignorance may spring up. But are you prepared to admit that the Ambrosial itself conduces to occasions for lusting, to lusting after, wishing for, being inebriated, and captivated by, languishing for? That it conduces to occasions for hatred, anger, and resentment? That it conduces to occasions for delusion, for depriving of knowledge, for blinding vision, for suspending insight, for siding with trouble, for failing to win <i>Nibbāna</i>? Is it not rather the opposite of all these? How then can you say that, on account of the Ambrosial occupying the mind, lust, hate, and ignorance spring up? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.2.5' href='#pts-cs9.2.5'>PTS cs 9.2.5</a> All these things you may truly predicate as springing up because of the occupation of the mind with material qualities (<i>rūpa</i>). But material qualities are not the Ambrosial.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.2.6' href='#pts-cs9.2.6'>PTS cs 9.2.6</a>You would not say that, whereas the Fetters spring up because of material qualities, the latter do <em>not</em> conduce to Fetters, Ties, Floods, and all such spiritual defects and dangers. How then can you affirm just the same of the Ambrosial: that, whereas the Fetters spring up because of it, it does not conduce to Fetters, and so forth? Or that, whereas lust, hate, and ignorance spring up because of the Ambrosial, nevertheless the Ambrosial is not an occasion for lusting and all the rest?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.2.7' href='#pts-cs9.2.7'>PTS cs 9.2.7</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“He perceives <i>Nibbāna</i> as such, and having perceived it he imagines things about <i>Nibbāna</i>, with respect to <i>Nibbāna</i>, <a class='pc' id='pc233' href='#pc233'></a> things as <i>Nibbāna</i>, that “<i>Nibbāna</i> is mine”, dallying with the idea”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore the Ambrosial is an object of thought not yet freed from bondage.</p>
