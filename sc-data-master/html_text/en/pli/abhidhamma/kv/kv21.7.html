<h1>21.7 Of Phenomena</h1>

<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That all things are by nature immutable.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21.7.1' href='#pts-cs21.7.1'>PTS cs 21.7.1</a>Do you mean that they all belong to that Order of things, by which the wrong-doer is assured of immediate retribution on rebirth, or to that other Order by which the Path-winner is assured of final salvation? Is there not a third congeries that is not fixed as one or the other? You deny. But think. Surely there is? You assent. Then you contradict your proposition. And you must do so, for did not the Exalted One speak of three congeries?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21.7.3' href='#pts-cs21.7.3'>PTS cs 21.7.3</a>You affirm <span class='add'>as your reason</span> that matter is fixed as matter, and that mind (or each mental aggregate) is fixed as mind. Well, then, under which of those three congeries do you find them fixed?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka, Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs21.7.4' href='#pts-cs21.7.4'>PTS cs 21.7.4</a>But if I may not say that matter, or mind is fixed as matter, or mind respectively, tell me, can body become mind, can become one of the four mental aggregates, or conversely? Of course not. Surely then I am right.</p>
