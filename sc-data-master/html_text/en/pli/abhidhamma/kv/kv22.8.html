<h1>22.8 Of Momentary Duration</h1>

<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That all things are momentary conscious units.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.8.1' href='#pts-cs22.8.1'>PTS cs 22.8.1</a>Do you imply that a mountain, the ocean, Sineru chief of mountains, the cohesive, fiery, and mobile elements, grass, twigs, trees, all last <span class='add'>only so long</span> in consciousness?
