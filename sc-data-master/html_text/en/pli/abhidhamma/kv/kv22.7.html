<h1>22.7 Of Correlation by Repetition</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That there is no correlation by way of repetition.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.7.1' href='#pts-cs22.7.1'>PTS cs 22.7.1</a>But was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“The taking of life, <i>bhikkhus</i>, when habitually practised and multiplied, is conducive to rebirth in purgatory, or among animals, or Petas. In its slightest form it results in, and is conducive to, a brief life among men”?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.7.2' href='#pts-cs22.7.2'>PTS cs 22.7.2</a>And again:</p>
<p>“Theft, <i>bhikkhus</i>, adultery, lying, slander, uttering harsh words, idle talk, intoxication, habitually practised and multiplied, are each and all conducive to rebirth in purgatory, among animals, or Petas. The slightest theft results in, conduces to destruction of property; the mildest offence against chastity gives rise to retaliatory measures among men; the lightest form of lying exposes the liar to false accusation among men; the mildest offence in slander leads to a rupture of friendship <a class='pc' id='pc363' href='#pc363'></a>among men; the lightest result of harsh words creates sounds jarring on the human ear; the slightest result of idle talk is speech commanding no respect among men; the mildest inebriety conduces to want of sanity among men”?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.7.3-4' href='#pts-cs22.7.3-4'>PTS cs 22.7.3–4</a>And again:</p>
<p>“Wrong views, <i>bhikkhus</i>, wrong aspiration, effort, speech, activity, livelihood, mindfulness, concentration—each and all, if habitually practised, developed, and multiplied, conduce to rebirth in purgatory, among animals, among Petas”?</p>
<p>And again:</p>
<p>“Right views, right purpose, etc., habitually practised, developed, and multiplied, have their base and their goal and their end in the Ambrosial”?</p>
