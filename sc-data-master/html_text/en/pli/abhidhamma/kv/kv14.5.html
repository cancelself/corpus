<h1>14.5 Of Latent Bias as Something Apart</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That latent bias, in any of the seven forms, is different in kind from a patent outbreak of the vice.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.5.1' href='#pts-cs14.5.1'>PTS cs 14.5.1</a>Do you equally maintain that the lusts of sense are different in kind from the lusts of sense openly manifested? You deny, but you cannot then maintain your proposition. You cannot maintain that the lusts of sense are the same as those lusts manifested, and yet deny <a class='pc' id='pc288' href='#pc288'></a> the identity in the case of the manifesting of them and the latent bias.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.5.2-7' href='#pts-cs14.5.2-7'>PTS cs 14.5.2–7</a>This argument holds good for the other six forms—enmity, conceit, erroneous opinion, doubt, lust of life, ignorance.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs14.5.8' href='#pts-cs14.5.8'>PTS cs 14.5.8</a>But if I am wrong, may not an average worldly man, while thinking what is good or unmoral, be said to have latent bias, but not to be openly manifesting any of its forms?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> If you conclude from this that your proposition is right, you must equally admit that, whereas such a person may also be said to have lust, though he be not openly manifesting it, lust is different in kind from open manifestation of it.</p>
