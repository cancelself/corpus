<h1>5.7 Of the Mental Object in Telepathy</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That insight into the thoughts of another has no object beyond bare other-consciousness as such.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.7.1' href='#pts-cs5.7.1'>PTS cs 5.7.1</a>You admit, do you not, that one may discern a “lust-ridden consciousness”, and so on as such? Then this disposes of your proposition.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.7.2' href='#pts-cs5.7.2'>PTS cs 5.7.2</a>Again, you cannot deny that, in thought-discerning, insight can have as its object contact, feeling, etc. <span class='add'>or any of the concomitants of consciousness</span>. Where then is bare consciousness as sole object?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.7.3' href='#pts-cs5.7.3'>PTS cs 5.7.3</a>Or do you dispute the statement that insight having contact, or feeling, or the rest as its object, comes into thought-discerning? “Yes” you say? But does not thought-discerning include discerning the course of contact, feeling, etc.? This you now deny.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.7.4' href='#pts-cs5.7.4'>PTS cs 5.7.4</a>You say my proposition is wrong. But is not this thought-discerning insight limited to a portion of the course of thought <span class='add'>in others</span>? Then surely I am right.</p>

<li>Cross-references were linked.</li>
<li>Some typographic changes were introduced, among others, i.e.: the phonetic symbol “ŋ” was changed to the Pāli diacritical letter “ṃ”, “ô” to “o”, single quotes to double quotes, and “:—” to “:”.</li>
