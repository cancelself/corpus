<h1>6.1 Of Assurance <span class='add'>of salvation</span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc185' href='#pc185'></a>: That “Assurance” is unconditioned.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.1.1' href='#pts-cs6.1.1'>PTS cs 6.1.1</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Then is Assurance <span class='add'>that other unconditioned called</span> <i>Nibbāna</i>, or the Shelter, the Cave, the Refuge, the Goal, the Past-Decease, the Ambrosial? You deny. Yet you would call both alike unconditioned. Are there then two kinds of unconditioned? If you deny, you cannot affirm; if you assent, then <span class='add'>for all we know</span> there are two Shelters … two Goals … two <i>Nibbānas</i>. If you deny, you cannot affirm your proposition; if you assent, then do you allow that of the two <i>Nibbānas</i> one is higher than the other, sublimer than the other, exalted more than the other? Is there a boundary, or a division, or a line, or an interstice between them? Of course you deny …</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.1.2' href='#pts-cs6.1.2'>PTS cs 6.1.2</a>Again, are there any who enter into and attain Assurance, cause it to arise, to keep arising, set it up, continue to set it up, bring it to pass, to come into being, produce it, continue to produce it? “Of course”, you say. <a class='pc' id='pc186' href='#pc186'></a> But are these terms that you can apply to what is unconditioned? Of course not … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.1.3' href='#pts-cs6.1.3'>PTS cs 6.1.3</a>Again, is the Path (the Fourfold) unconditioned? “Nay”, you say, “conditioned”. Yet you would make Assurance unconditioned; the Path of Stream-Winning, Once-Returning, Never-Returning, Arahantship, conditioned; but Assurance of Stream-Winning, etc., unconditioned!… .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.1.4' href='#pts-cs6.1.4'>PTS cs 6.1.4</a>If then these four stages of Assurance be unconditioned, and <i>Nibbāna</i> be unconditioned, are there five kinds of the unconditioned? If you assent, you are in the same difficulty as before (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs6.1.1'>PTS CS 6.1.1</a>).</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.1.5' href='#pts-cs6.1.5'>PTS cs 6.1.5</a>Finally, is false Assurance unconditioned? “No, conditioned”, you say. But has true Assurance the same quality? Here you must deny … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs6.1.6' href='#pts-cs6.1.6'>PTS cs 6.1.6</a>If I am wrong, would you say that, if Assurance having arisen for anyone and ceased, his work of making sure <span class='add'>his salvation</span> would be cancelled?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> No.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> Then Assurance must be unconditioned <span class='add'>that is, it cannot begin and cease.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> But your argument can be applied to false Assurance. You would not therefore call that unconditioned!</p>
