<h1>22.3 Of Imperturbable (Fourth <i>Jhāna</i>) Consciousness</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the Arahant completes existence in imperturbable absorption (<i>āneñje</i>).</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.3.1' href='#pts-cs22.3.1'>PTS cs 22.3.1</a>But does he not complete existence with ordinary (or normal) consciousness? You agree. How, then, do you reconcile this with your proposition?</p>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc360' href='#pc360'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.3.2' href='#pts-cs22.3.2'>PTS cs 22.3.2</a>You are implying that he passes away with an ethically inoperative consciousness. Is it not rather with a consciousness that is pure “result”? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.3.3' href='#pts-cs22.3.3'>PTS cs 22.3.3</a> Whereas according to you he passes away with a consciousness that is unmoral and purely inoperative, I suggest that it is with a consciousness that is unmoral and purely resultant.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs22.3.4' href='#pts-cs22.3.4'>PTS cs 22.3.4</a>And did not the Exalted One emerge from Fourth <i>Jhāna</i> before he passed utterly away immediately after?</p>
