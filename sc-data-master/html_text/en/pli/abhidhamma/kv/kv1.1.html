<h2>The Eight Refutations</h2>
<h3>The First Refutation</h3>
<h4>The Fivefold Affirmative Presentation</h4>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.1' href='#pts-cs1.1.1'>PTS cs 1.1.1</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Is “the person” known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Yes<a class='pc' id='pc9' href='#pc9'></a>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Is the person known <em>in the same way</em> as a real and ultimate fact is known?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Nay, that cannot truly be said.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Acknowledge your refutation:</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>If the person be known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, then indeed, good sir, you should also say, the person is known in the same way as <span class='add'>any other</span> real and ultimate fact <span class='add'>is known</span>.</li>
<li>That which you say here is wrong, namely, (1) that we ought to say, “the person is known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact”, but (2) we ought not to say, the person is known in the same way as <span class='add'>any other</span> real and ultimate fact <span class='add'>is known</span>.</li>
<li>If the latter statement (2) cannot be admitted, then indeed the former statement (1) should not be admitted.</li>
<li>In affirming the former statement (1), while</li>
<li>denying the latter (2), you are wrong.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Fourfold Rejoinder</h4>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.2' href='#pts-cs1.1.2'>PTS cs 1.1.2</a><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Is the “person” not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> No, it is not known.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Is it unknown in the same way as any real and ultimate fact is <span class='add'>known</span>?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Nay, that cannot truly be said.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Acknowledge the rejoinder: (1) If the person be not <a class='pc' id='pc10' href='#pc10'></a> known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, then indeed, good sir, you should also say: not known in the same way as any real and ultimate fact is known. (2) That which you say here is wrong, namely, that (1) we ought to say “the person is not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact”, and (2) we ought not to say: “not known in the same way as any real and ultimate fact is known”.</p>
<p>If the latter statement (2) cannot be admitted, then indeed the former statement (1) should not be admitted either.</p>
<p>In affirming (2), while denying (1), you are wrong.</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Refutation</h4>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.3' href='#pts-cs1.1.3'>PTS cs 1.1.3</a><span class='add'>Puggalavādin (continues):</span> But if you imagine we ought to affirm that (1) the person is not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, but we ought not also to affirm that (2) the “person” is not known in the same way as <span class='add'>any</span> real and ultimate fact <span class='add'>is known</span>, then you, who have actually assented to the very proposition contained in that negative question, must certainly be refuted in the following manner: let us then refute you, for you are well refuted!</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>If (1) the “person” is not known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, then indeed, good sir, you should have said <span class='add'>as well</span> that (2) the “person” is not known in the same way as any real and ultimate fact is known.</li>
<li>What you affirm is false, namely, that the former statement (1) should be affirmed, but that the latter (2) should not be affirmed.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the latter statement (2) is not to be affirmed, then neither truly can the former (1) be affirmed.</p>
<p>That which you say here—(1) should be affirmed, but not (2); this statement of yours is wrong.</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Application</h4>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.4' href='#pts-cs1.1.4'>PTS cs 1.1.4</a><span class='add'>Puggalavādin (continues):</span> If this be a faulty refutation, look at the parallel procedure in your own argument (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs1.1.1'>PTS CS 1.1.1</a>). Thus, according to us (1) was true (the person is known, etc.); but (2) was not true (… known in the same way, etc.). Now we, who admitted these propositions, do not consider ourselves to have been refuted. <span class='add'>You say</span> you have refuted us; anyway we are not well refuted. Your argument ran that if we affirmed (1), we must also affirm (2); that if we did not admit the truth of (2), neither could we admit the truth of (1); that we were wrong in assenting to (1), while denying (2).</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Conclusion</h4>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.5' href='#pts-cs1.1.5'>PTS cs 1.1.5</a><span class='add'>Puggalavādin (continues):</span> Nay (I repeat), we are not to be refuted thus,</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>namely, that my proposition compels me to assent to your “known in the same way”, etc.;</li>
<li>your pronouncement that my proposition (1) coupled with my rejection (2) is wrong;</li>
<li>that if I reject (2), I must also reject (1);</li>
<li>that I must affirm both or none.</li>
</ol>
<p>This refutation of yours is badly done. I maintain, on the other hand, that my rejoinder was well done, and that my sequel to the argument was well done.</p>
<h3>The Second Refutation</h3>
<h4>The Fivefold Adverse Controversy</h4>

<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.8' href='#pts-cs1.1.8'>PTS cs 1.1.8</a>But if you imagine we ought to affirm that “the person” is known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, but that we ought not to affirm as well that the person is known in the same way as <span class='add'>any other</span> real and ultimate fact <span class='add'>is known</span>, etc.…<span class='pe'><em>continue as in <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs1.1.3'>PTS CS 1.1.3</a>, reversing the speakers, and substituting</em> “known” <em>for</em> “not known”.</span></p>
<h4>The Fourfold Application</h4>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin (continues):</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.9' href='#pts-cs1.1.9'>PTS cs 1.1.9</a>If this be a faulty refutation, look at the parallel procedure in your own argument (<a class='cr' href='#pts-cs1.1.6'>PTS CS 1.1.6</a>). Thus, according to us (a) was true (a soul is not known, etc.); but (b) was not true (… not known in the same way, etc.). Now we, who admitted these propositions, do not consider ourselves to have been refuted, etc.</p>
<h4>The Fourfold Conclusion.</h4>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin: (continues):</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.10' href='#pts-cs1.1.10'>PTS cs 1.1.10</a>Nay, I repeat, we are not to be refuted as you claim to have refuted us … wherefore your refutation was ill done, etc.</p>
<h3>The Third Refutation</h3>

<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc13' href='#pc13'></a>It is.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Is the person known <em>everywhere</em> in that sense?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Nay, that cannot truly be said.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Acknowledge the refutation: If the person be known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, then indeed, good sir, you ought to admit that the person is known in that sense everywhere. You are wrong to admit the one proposition (A) and deny the other (C). If (C) is false, (A) is also false.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Refutation</h3>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.12' href='#pts-cs1.1.12'>PTS cs 1.1.12</a>Is the person known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> It is.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Is the person known <span class='add'>always</span> in that sense?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Nay, that cannot truly be said … <span class='pe'><em>continue as above, substituting</em> “always” <em>for</em> “everywhere”.</span></p>
<h3>The Fifth Refutation</h3>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.13' href='#pts-cs1.1.13'>PTS cs 1.1.13</a>Is the person known … <span class='pe'><em>as in <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs1.1.11'>PTS CS 1.1.11</a></em></span> …<em>in everything</em> in the sense of a real and ultimate fact? <span class='pe'><em>continue as in <a class='cr' href='#pts-cs1.1.11'>PTS CS 1.1.11</a>, substituting</em> “in everything” <em>for</em> “everywhere”.</span></p>

<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.15' href='#pts-cs1.1.15'>PTS cs 1.1.15</a>Is the person <em>not</em> known … always in that sense? …</p>

<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.16' href='#pts-cs1.1.16'>PTS cs 1.1.16</a>Is the person not known … in everything that sense? …</p>
<h2>Comparative Inquiry</h2>
<h3>Comparison with other Realities, simply treated</h3>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs1.1.17' href='#pts-cs1.1.17'>PTS cs 1.1.17</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Is the person known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact, and is material quality also known in the sense of a real and ultimate fact?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Is material quality one thing and the person another?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Nay, that cannot truly be said.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Acknowledge the refutation: If the person and material quality be each known in the sense of real and ultimate facts, then indeed, good sir, you should also have admitted that they are distinct things. You are wrong to <a class='pc' id='pc15' href='#pc15'></a> admit the former proposition and not the latter. If the latter cannot be admitted, neither should the former be affirmed. To say that the person and material quality are both known in the sense of real and ultimate facts, but that they are not mutually distinct things, is false.</p>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“`Being'? What dost thou fancy by that word?<br>
'Mong false opinions, Māra, art thou strayed.<br>
This a mere bundle of formations is.<br>
Therefrom no `being' mayest thou obtain.<br>
For e'en as, when the factors are arranged,<br>
The product by the name `chariot' is known,<br>
So doth our usage covenant to say:<br>
`A being', when the aggregates are there.</p>
<p>'Tis simply Ill that riseth, simply Ill<br>
That doth persist, and then fadeth away.<br>
Nought beside Ill there is that comes to be;<br>
Nought else but Ill there is that fades away”?</p>

<p>Is the Suttanta thus?</p>

<p>“It is said, lord, `the world is void, the world is void'. Now in what way, lord, is it meant that the world is void”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>and did not the Exalted One reply:</span></p>
<p>“Inasmuch, Ānanda, as it is void of soul and of what belongs to soul, therefore is the world called void. And wherein, Ānanda, is it void of soul and of what belongs to soul? The eye, Ānanda, is verily void of soul and of what belongs to soul, so is visible object and the sense and contact of sight. So are the other organs, and objects of the senses, and the other senses. So is the co-ordinating organ, cognizable objects, mental consciousness and contact. All are void of soul and of what belongs to soul. And whatever pleasurable, painful, or neutral feeling <a class='pc' id='pc62' href='#pc62'></a> arises, in relation to the senses, and the sense-co-ordinating mind that too is void of soul and of what belongs to soul. It is for this, Ānanda, that the world is said to be void”?</p>
<p>Is the Suttanta thus?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>

<p>“<i>Bhikkhus</i>, if there were soul, should I have that which belongs to a soul? Or if there were that which belongs to soul, should I have a soul? In both cases ye would reply: `Yea, lord'. But both soul and that which belongs to soul being in very truth and for ever impossible to be known, then this that is a stage of opinion, namely: `<em>that</em> is the world, <em>that</em> is the soul, this I shall hereafter become, permanent, constant, eternal, unchangeable—so shall I abide even like unto the Eternal'—is not this, <i>bhikkhus</i>, absolutely and entirely a doctrine of fools?” “Whatever it be not, lord, it surely is, absolutely and entirely a doctrine of fools”.</p>

<p>“There are these three teachers, Seniya, to be found in the world—who are the three? There is first, Seniya, that kind of teacher who declares that there is a real, persistent soul in the life that now is, and in that which is to come; then there is the kind of teacher, Seniya, who declares that there is a real, persistent soul in the life that now is, but not a soul in a future life; lastly, there is a certain teacher who does not declare that there is a soul either in the life that now is, nor in that which is to come. The first, Seniya, of these three is called an Eternalist, the second is called an Annihilationist; the third of these, he, Seniya, is called the teacher, who is Buddha supreme.

<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> … again, did the Exalted One speak of “a butter-jar”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Is there anyone who can make a jar out of butter?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Nay, that cannot truly be said … .</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> … finally, did the Exalted One speak of an oil-jar, a honey-jar, a molasses-jar, a milk-pail, a water-pot, a cup, flask, bowl of water, a “meal provided in perpetuity”, a “constant supply of congey”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Puggalavādin:</span> Yes.</p>
