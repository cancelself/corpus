<h1>23.5 Of the Undetermined</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That the aggregates, elements, controlling powers—all save Ill, is undetermined.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs23.5.1' href='#pts-cs23.5.1'>PTS cs 23.5.1</a>Do you then maintain that <span class='add'>the marks of the conditioned are lacking in, say, the material aggregate—that</span> matter is not impermanent, not conditioned, has not arisen because of something, is not liable to decay, to perish, to be devoid of passion, to cessation, to change? Is not the opposite true?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs23.5.2' href='#pts-cs23.5.2'>PTS cs 23.5.2</a>Do you imply that only Ill is caused? Yes? But did not the Exalted One say that whatever was impermanent was Ill? Hence, if this be so, and since matter is impermanent, you cannot maintain that only Ill is determined.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs23.5.3' href='#pts-cs23.5.3'>PTS cs 23.5.3</a>The same argument holds good for the other four aggregates (mental), for all the mechanism of sense, for all controlling powers.</p>
