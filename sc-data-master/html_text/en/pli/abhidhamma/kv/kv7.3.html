<h1>7.3 Of Mental Properties</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc197' href='#pc197'></a>: That they do not exist.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.3.1' href='#pts-cs7.3.1'>PTS cs 7.3.1</a>You surely do not also deny that some mental phenomena are concomitant, co-existent, conjoined with consciousness, have their genesis and cessation, physical basis and object in common with it? Why then exclude the “mental”? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.3.2' href='#pts-cs7.3.2'>PTS cs 7.3.2</a> Contact, for instance, is co-existent with consciousness; hence it is a “mental”, i.e., a property or concomitant of mind. So are feeling, perception, volition, faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, understanding, lust, hate, dullness,… indiscretion—all the “mentals”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Rājagirika, Siddhatthika:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.3.3' href='#pts-cs7.3.3'>PTS cs 7.3.3</a>You allow then that what is co-existent with consciousness is a “mental”. Do you equally admit that what is co-existent with contact is a “contactal”, or that what is co-existent with each of those mental phenomena is to be analogously regarded; for instance, that what is co-existent with indiscretion is an “indiscretional”?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> Certainly. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.3.4' href='#pts-cs7.3.4'>PTS cs 7.3.4</a> And if you assert that there are no mental phenomena corresponding to our term “mentals”,</p>
<p>was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Yea! verily this mind and mental states<br>
Are void of soul for one who understands.<br>
Whoso discerns the low and high in both,<br>
The seer, he knows that neither can endure”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc198' href='#pc198'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs7.3.5' href='#pts-cs7.3.5'>PTS cs 7.3.5</a>Or again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Suppose in this case, Kevaṭṭa, that a <i>bhikkhu</i> can make manifest the mind, and the mental <span class='add'>property</span>, and the direction and application of thought in other beings, other individuals, saying: Such is your mind. This is your mind. Thus and thus are you conscious”?</p>
<p>Hence there is such a thing as a “mental” <span class='add'>that is, a property, or concomitant, of consciousness or mind</span></p>
