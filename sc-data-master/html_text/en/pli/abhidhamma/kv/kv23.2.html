<h1>23.2 Of Bogus Arahants</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc366' href='#pc366'></a>: That infra-human beings, taking the shape of Arahants, follow sexual desires.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs23.2.1' href='#pts-cs23.2.1'>PTS cs 23.2.1</a>Would you also say that such beings, resembling Arahants, commit any or all such crimes as are stated above (<a class='cr' href='/kv23.1/en/aung-rhysdavids'>Kv 23.1</a>)? You deny; but why limit them to one only of those crimes?</p>
