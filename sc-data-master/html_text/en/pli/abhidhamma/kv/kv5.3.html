<h1>5.3 Of Perverted Perception or Hallucination (in <i>Jhāna</i>)</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That in one who has attained <i>Jhāna</i> through the earth-artifice, etc., knowledge <span class='add'>of what is seen</span> is perverted.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.3.1' href='#pts-cs5.3.1'>PTS cs 5.3.1</a>If your proposition is right, then do you imply that this “perversion” is the same as that involved in seeing the permanent in the impermanent, happiness in Ill, a soul in what is not soul, the beautiful in the ugly? Of course you deny.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.3.2' href='#pts-cs5.3.2'>PTS cs 5.3.2</a>Again, you imply that such a person's knowledge during <i>Jhāna</i> is not proficient. But you do not wish to imply this, but the opposite.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.3.3' href='#pts-cs5.3.3'>PTS cs 5.3.3</a>You admit that the reversal of judgment which sees permanence in impermanence is a bad judgment, and those other judgments above-stated also. Yet you will not admit that cognition during <i>Jhāna</i> is badly accomplished.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.3.4' href='#pts-cs5.3.4'>PTS cs 5.3.4</a>You hold on the contrary that it is well accomplished. Yet a similar perversion in the case of those other four judgments you consider bad.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.3.5' href='#pts-cs5.3.5'>PTS cs 5.3.5</a>If it were an Arahant who so accomplished <i>Jhāna</i>, would you claim a perverted cognition for him? You could not. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.3.6' href='#pts-cs5.3.6'>PTS cs 5.3.6</a> Or, if you could, you would have to make him liable to reversals of perception, consciousness, and views in general.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.3.7' href='#pts-cs5.3.7'>PTS cs 5.3.7</a>But if my proposition is wrong, do you hold that, when any one attains <i>Jhāna</i> by earth-cognition, everything becomes earth to him? No, you reply. Then surely his judgment is upset.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc177' href='#pc177'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs5.3.8' href='#pts-cs5.3.8'>PTS cs 5.3.8</a>But you will admit that the earth is there, and that the subject enters <i>Jhāna</i> by regarding earth as earth? Where then is the perversion of cognition?</p>
<p>You say that the earth is actually there, and that in entering <i>Jhāna</i> by the consciousness of earth as earth, perception is perverted. Substitute for earth <i>Nibbāna</i>: would you still say that perception was perverted? … .</p>
