<h1>16.7 Of Matter as Morally Good or Bad</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That material qualities are (i.) good or moral, (ii.) bad or immoral.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.7.1' href='#pts-cs16.7.1'>PTS cs 16.7.1</a>Do you mean to imply that material qualities have a mental object, and the properties of mental adverting, of adjustment, etc.? Surely you agree that the opposite is true? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.7.2' href='#pts-cs16.7.2'>PTS cs 16.7.2</a> And that, whereas you can predicate those things of the three moral motives or conditions, and of the five moral controlling powers, <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.7.3' href='#pts-cs16.7.3'>PTS cs 16.7.3</a> they do not fit the case of material qualities … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.7.4-6' href='#pts-cs16.7.4-6'>PTS cs 16.7.4–6</a>(ii.) The same argument holds good for material qualities as immoral.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahiṁsāsaka, Sammitiya:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc309' href='#pc309'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.7.7' href='#pts-cs16.7.7'>PTS cs 16.7.7</a>But is not <i>karma</i> (moral action) of body and of speech either good or bad? Surely then material qualities <span class='add'>engaged therein</span> are also either good or bad?</p>
