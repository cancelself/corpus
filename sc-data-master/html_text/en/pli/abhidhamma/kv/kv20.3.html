<h1>20.3 Of the Guards of Purgatory</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That in the purgatories there are no guards.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.3.1' href='#pts-cs20.3.1'>PTS cs 20.3.1</a>Do you imply that there are no punishments inflicted in the purgatories? You maintain the contrary? But you cannot maintain both propositions.</p>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc346' href='#pc346'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.3.2' href='#pts-cs20.3.2'>PTS cs 20.3.2</a>You admit that on earth there are both punishments and executioners? Yet you deny that the latter exist in purgatory … .</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.3.3' href='#pts-cs20.3.3'>PTS cs 20.3.3</a>Moreover, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Not Vessabhu nor yet the Petas' King,<br>
Soma, Yama, or King Vessavaṇa—<br>
The deeds that were his own do punish him<br>
Who ending here attains to other worlds”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence there are guards in purgatory.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.3.4' href='#pts-cs20.3.4'>PTS cs 20.3.4</a>Again, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Him, <i>bhikkhus</i>, hell's guards torture with the fivefold punishment; they thrust a hot iron stake through one hand, then another through the other hand, then one through the foot, then another through the other foot; they thrust a hot iron stake through the middle of the chest. And he thereupon feels painful, piercing, intolerable suffering, nor does he die till that evil deed of his is cancelled”?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs20.3.5' href='#pts-cs20.3.5'>PTS cs 20.3.5</a>Again, was it not said <span class='add'>further</span> by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“Him, <i>bhikkhus</i>, hell's guards make to lie down and flay him with hatchets … they place him head downwards and flay him with knives … they bind him to a chariot and drive him to and fro over burning, blazing, glowing ground … they lift him up on to a great hill of burning, blazing, white-hot coals and roll him down the fiery slope … they double him up and cast him into a hot brazen jar, burning, blazing, glowing, where he boils, coming up like a bubble of foam, then sinking, going now to this side, now to that. There he suffers fierce and bitter pain, nor does he die till that evil <i>karma</i> is cancelled. Him, <i>bhikkhus</i>, they cast into the Great Purgatory. Now this:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“<span class='add'>In</span> <a class='pc' id='pc347' href='#pc347'></a> districts measured out four-square, four-doored,<br>
Iron the ramparts bounding it, with iron roofed,<br>
Iron its soil welded by fiery heat,<br>
Spreading a hundred leagues it stands for aye”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence there surely are guards in purgatory.</p>
