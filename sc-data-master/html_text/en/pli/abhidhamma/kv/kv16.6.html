<h1>16.6 Matter and Concomitant Moral Conditions</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That material qualities are accompanied by moral conditions.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.6.1' href='#pts-cs16.6.1'>PTS cs 16.6.1</a>That is (i.) they must be accompanied by one or more of the six motives or moral conditions, either good or bad; (ii.) they have a mental object or idea, having the properties of mental adverting, adjustment, etc.…</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.6.2' href='#pts-cs16.6.2'>PTS cs 16.6.2</a>If you admit that disinterestedness, love, and the other four, moral conditions, have a mental object and involve mental adverting, adjustment, etc., then you must describe material qualities in the same terms. <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.6.3' href='#pts-cs16.6.3'>PTS cs 16.6.3</a> And if that be so, you cannot deny either attribute to material qualities without equally denying it to the moral conditions.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs16.6.4' href='#pts-cs16.6.4'>PTS cs 16.6.4</a>But is not matter in causal relations? You agree. Then it is surely right to say material qualities are accompanied by <span class='add'>moral conditions or</span> motives.</p>
