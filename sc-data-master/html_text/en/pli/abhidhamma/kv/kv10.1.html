<h1>10.1 Of Cessation</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc243' href='#pc243'></a>: That before five aggregates seeking rebirth have ceased, five operative aggregates arise.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.1.1' href='#pts-cs10.1.1'>PTS cs 10.1.1</a>Is there then a congeries of ten aggregates? Do ten aggregates arrive at actuality? If you deny, where is your proposition? If you assent, you must answer for two copies of each aggregate <span class='add'>which is unorthodox.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.1.2' href='#pts-cs10.1.2'>PTS cs 10.1.2</a>The same argument holds if you maintain that only four operative aggregates may arise, substituting “nine” for “ten” <span class='add'>i.e., five <span class='add'>plus</span> four.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.1.3' href='#pts-cs10.1.3'>PTS cs 10.1.3</a>And the same argument holds if you maintain that only operative insight arises, substituting “six” for “nine” <span class='add'>i.e., five <span class='add'>plus</span> one.</span></p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs10.1.4' href='#pts-cs10.1.4'>PTS cs 10.1.4</a>When the five aggregates seeking rebirth cease, does the Path then arise?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='pc' id='pc244' href='#pc244'></a>Yes.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Andhaka:</span> What! do the dead, does one who has ended his days, develop the Path?</p>
