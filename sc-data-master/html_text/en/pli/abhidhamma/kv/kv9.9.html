<h1>9.9 Of Speech conforming to Thought</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That speech does not accord with thought.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.9.1' href='#pts-cs9.9.1'>PTS cs 9.9.1</a><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> If this be so, then <i>a fortiori</i> neither does speech accord with mental contact, feeling, perception, volition, nor with any property of consciousness. But surely, as you agree, the opposite is the case.</p>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc241' href='#pc241'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.9.2' href='#pts-cs9.9.2'>PTS cs 9.9.2</a>You must, again, deny that speech accords with adverting, ideating, co-ordinated application, willing, intending, aiming—which you will not, the opposite being true.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.9.3' href='#pts-cs9.9.3'>PTS cs 9.9.3</a>You admit that speech which is provoked by thought is co-existent, and one in its origin, with the thought. Yet this is in contradiction to your proposition.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.9.4' href='#pts-cs9.9.4'>PTS cs 9.9.4</a>Again, you commit yourself to this, that one speaks of what one does not wish to speak, discourses, addresses <span class='add'>others</span>, converses about what one does not wish. Surely the opposite is the case.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Pubbaseliya:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs9.9.5' href='#pts-cs9.9.5'>PTS cs 9.9.5</a>You say I am wrong, but you must admit that people can speak, discourse, address <span class='add'>others</span>, converse about something different <span class='add'>from that which is occupying their minds</span>. Hence my proposition is tenable.</p>
