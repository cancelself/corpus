<h1>2.3 Of Doubt in the Arahant</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc118' href='#pc118'></a>: That an Arahant may have doubts.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs2.3.20' href='#pts-cs2.3.20'>PTS cs 2.3.20</a>Again, did not the Exalted One say in the Suttanta:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p>“Whene'er in sooth ardently meditating<br>
The brahmin sees <span class='add'>the truth of</span> things revealed,<br>
All doubts are rolled away, for now he knoweth<br>
That which befalls and likewise its conditions.</p>
<p>“Whene'er in sooth ardently meditating<br>
The brahmin sees <span class='add'>the truth of</span> things revealed,<br>
All doubts are rolled away, for he discerneth<br>
That which doth make befall may be abolished.</p>
<p>“Whene'er in sooth ardent and meditating<br>
The brahmin sees the truth of things revealed,<br>
He standeth victor o'er the hosts of evil,<br>
E'en as the sun that lighteth up the heavens.</p>
<p>“All doubts soever as to here or yonder.<br>
Felt by themselves, or doubts that torture others<br>
Thinkers renounce in ardent meditation.<br>
Choosing to follow after holy conduct.</p>
<p>“<span class='add'>They</span> <a class='pc' id='pc119' href='#pc119'></a> who 'mong souls beset by doubts, past all doubt<br>
Have won, and note unswayed, from bonds enfranchised<br>
Abide, to them a great reward is given.</p>
<p>“How should disciple ever doubt<br>
That by the kind who here abide<br>
The truth may yet be realized?<br>
All hail to Buddha who hath crossed<br>
The flood and severed every doubt,<br>
Great Conqueror and Lord of all”?</p>
