<h1>12.3 Of Sound as Result <span class='add'>of <i>Karma</i></span></h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That sound is a result of <i>karma</i>.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12.3.1' href='#pts-cs12.3.1'>PTS cs 12.3.1</a><span class='add'>Now what can rightly be predicated of a “result of <i>karma</i>”?</span> Such a result is a matter of feeling, pleasant, painful, or neutral; it is conjoined with feeling <a class='pc' id='pc267' href='#pc267'></a> of these three kinds; it is conjoined with mental contact, feeling, perception, volition, thought; it goes with a mental object; with it go adverting, ideating, co-ordinated application, attention, volition, anticipation, aiming. Is sound anything of this kind? Is it not rather the opposite?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12.3.2' href='#pts-cs12.3.2'>PTS cs 12.3.2</a>Now mental contact is result of <i>karma</i>, and of mental contact it is right to predicate any of the foregoing characteristics, and wrong not to. But the opposite holds with regard to sound.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Mahāsaṅghikas:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs12.3.3' href='#pts-cs12.3.3'>PTS cs 12.3.3</a>But if I am wrong, was it not said by the Exalted One:</p>
<p>“He through having wrought, having accumulated, having piled up, having increased such <i>karma</i>, becomes reborn with the voice of a Brahma god, like that of the <i>karavīka</i> bird”?</p>
<p>Hence surely sound is a specific result of <i>karma</i>.</p>
