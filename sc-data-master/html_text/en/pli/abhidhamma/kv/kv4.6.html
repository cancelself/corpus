<h1>4.6 Of becoming “The Enlightened” (<i>Buddha</i>) through Enlightenment (<i>bodhi</i>)</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span><a class='pc' id='pc164' href='#pc164'></a>: That through Enlightenment one becomes “The Enlightened”.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.1' href='#pts-cs4.6.1'>PTS cs 4.6.1</a>If it is in virtue of “enlightenment” that one becomes “The Enlightened”, then it follows that, in virtue of the cessation, suspension, subsidence of enlightenment, he ceases to be The Enlightened—this you deny, but you imply it.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.2' href='#pts-cs4.6.2'>PTS cs 4.6.2</a>Or is one The Enlightened only in virtue of past enlightenment? Of course you deny this—<span class='add'>then my previous point holds</span>. If you assent, do you mean that one who is The Enlightened exercises the work of enlightenment by that past enlightenment only? If you assent, you imply that he understands Ill, puts away its cause, realizes its cessation, develops the Eightfold Path thereto, by that past enlightenment—which is absurd.</p>
<p><a class='pc' id='pc165' href='#pc165'></a><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.3' href='#pts-cs4.6.3'>PTS cs 4.6.3</a>Substitute for “past”, “future” enlightenment, and the same argument applies.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.4' href='#pts-cs4.6.4'>PTS cs 4.6.4</a>Let us assume that one is called The Enlightened through present enlightenment: if you assert that he exercises the work of enlightenment through present enlightenment, you must also affirm <span class='add'>by analogy</span> that if he is called The Enlightened through past, or <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.5' href='#pts-cs4.6.5'>PTS cs 4.6.5</a> through future enlightenment, it is by that that he understands Ill, puts away its cause, and so on—which you deny.</p>
<p>For<a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.6' href='#pts-cs4.6.6'>PTS cs 4.6.6</a> if an enlightened person, so-called in virtue of past, or <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.7' href='#pts-cs4.6.7'>PTS cs 4.6.7</a> of future enlightenment, does not exercise the work of enlightenment, through one or the other respectively, then <span class='add'>by analogy</span> one who is enlightened by present enlightenment does not exercise enlightenment through that present enlightenment—which is absurd.</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.8' href='#pts-cs4.6.8'>PTS cs 4.6.8</a>Do you then affirm that one is called The Enlightened through past, present, and future enlightenment? Then, are there three enlightenments? If you deny, your affirmation <span class='add'>by the foregoing</span> cannot stand. If you assent, you imply that he, being continually, constantly, uninterruptedly gifted with and intent through three enlightenments, these three are simultaneously present to him—which you of course deny.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Uttarāpathaka:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.9' href='#pts-cs4.6.9'>PTS cs 4.6.9</a>But surely one who is called The Enlightened is one who has acquired enlightenment? How is my proposition wrong?</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs4.6.10' href='#pts-cs4.6.10'>PTS cs 4.6.10</a>You assume that one is called The Enlightened from having acquired enlightenment, or by enlightenment—is enlightenment the same as the acquiring of enlightenment?</p>
