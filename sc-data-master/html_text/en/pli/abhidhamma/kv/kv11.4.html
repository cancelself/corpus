<h1>11.4 Of the Utterance, “This is Pain and Sorrow!”</h1>
</header>
<p><span class='add'>Controverted Point</span>: That from utterance of the word, “This is Ill!” insight into the nature of Ill is set working.</p>
<p><span class='add'>Theravādin:</span> <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.4.1' href='#pts-cs11.4.1'>PTS cs 11.4.1</a>But you deny that a similar result ensues on the utterance of the other three Truths: This is the Cause, this the Cessation, this the Path leading to the Cessation of Ill. Why is this? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.4.2' href='#pts-cs11.4.2'>PTS cs 11.4.2</a> Why deny for these what you affirm for the first Truth?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.4.3' href='#pts-cs11.4.3'>PTS cs 11.4.3</a>Or why deny, as you do, that insight into the impermanence of each of the five aggregates (body-mind) follows from statement of the fact? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.4.4' href='#pts-cs11.4.4'>PTS cs 11.4.4</a> Or, once more, <a class='pc' id='pc258' href='#pc258'></a> that insight into the soullessness of each aggregate follows from a statement of the fact? <a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.4.5-6' href='#pts-cs11.4.5-6'>PTS cs 11.4.5–6</a> On what grounds can you defend the sequence in one case only out of the three sets of five propositions?</p>
<p><a class='ref pts-cs' id='pts-cs11.4.7' href='#pts-cs11.4.7'>PTS cs 11.4.7</a>Now do you mean to tell me that insight issues from every syllable of this formula: This–is–pain–and–sor–row?</p>
