<p class='question'><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en9.1' href='#pts-vp-en9.1'>PTS vp En 9.1</a>What sort of person is a perfectly Enlightened One?</p>
<p>Here a certain person who, in regard to doctrines he has not heard of before, himself thoroughly understands the truths and attains the omniscience thereof as well as mastery over the fruition. This sort of person is said to be a perfectly Enlightened One.</p>
<p class='question'>What sort of person is one who is enlightened for himself?</p>
<p>Here a certain person who, in regard to doctrines he has not heard of before, himself thoroughly understands the truths but attains neither the omniscience nor the mastery over the fruition thereof. This sort of person is said to be one enlightened for himself.</p>
<p class='question'>What sort of person is emancipated in both ways?</p>
<p>Here a certain person goes on himself experiencing the eight stages of emancipation, and having perceived them through insight, his sinful tendencies are completely destroyed. This sort of person is said to be one emancipated in both ways.</p>
<p class='question'>What sort of person is emancipated by way of insight?</p>
<p>Here a certain person without himself experiencing the eight stages of emancipation, but having perceived them through insight, his sinful tendencies are completely destroyed. This sort of person is said to be one emancipated by insight.</p>
<p class='question'>What sort of person is an “eye-witness”?</p>
<p>Here a certain person goes on himself experiencing the eight stages of emancipation, and having perceived them through insight, some of his sinful tendencies are completely destroyed. This sort of person is said to be an “eye-witness”.</p>
<p class='question'>What sort of person is one who has won vision?</p>
<p>Here a certain person truly understands that this is suffering, that this is the genesis of suffering, that this is the cessation of suffering, and that this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering. The doctrines promulgated by the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Tathāgata</i> are perceived by him through insight as well as practised; and he having perceived them through insight, some of his sinful tendencies are completely destroyed. This sort of person is said to be one who has won vision.</p>
<p class='question'>What sort of person is emancipated by faith?</p>
<p>Here a certain person truly understands that this is suffering, that this is the genesis of suffering, that this is the cessation of suffering, and that this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering. The doctrines promulgated by the <i lang='pli' translate='no'>Tathāgata</i> are perceived by him through insight as well as practised; and having perceived them through insight, some of his sinful tendencies are completely destroyed, though not in the same way as in the case of one who has won vision. This sort of person is said to be one emancipated by faith.</p>
<p class='question'>What sort of person is one conforming to the Norm?</p>
<p>The faculty of insight of a person proceeding to realise the fruition stage of a stream-attainer develops to a large extent; he cultivates the noble path which carries with it insight and is preceded by insight. This sort of person is said to be one conforming to the Norm. Such a person striving after the fruition stage of stream-attaining is one conforming to the Norm; while the same person established in the fruition is one who has won vision.</p>
<p class='question'>What sort of person is one conforming to faith?</p>
<p>The faith-faculty proceeding to realise the fruition stage of stream-attaining develops to a large extent. He cultivates the noble path which carries with it faith and is preceded by faith. This sort of person is said to be one conforming to faith. Such a person striving after the fruition stage of stream-attaining is one conforming to faith; while the same person established in the fruition is emancipated by faith.</p>
