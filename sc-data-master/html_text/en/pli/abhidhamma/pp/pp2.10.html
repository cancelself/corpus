<p class='question'><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en10.1' href='#pts-vp-en10.1'>PTS vp En 10.1</a>By which five is consummation reached here?</p>
<p>The “stream-attainer” destined not to undergo more than seven births, the “stream-attainer” transmigrating through a few families (less than seven), the “single-seed” “stream-attainer”, the “once-returner”, and one attaining Arahantship in this very existence: of these five, consummation is reached here.</p>
<p class='question'>By which five is consummation reached after leaving this world?</p>
<p>“One who dies and attains Nirvāṇa before half the age he should have lived in a Brahmanic world expires”, the “term-curtailing passer-away”, the “automatic passer-away”, “one attaining Nirvāṇa through strenuous exertion”, “one proceeding upstream to the Akaṇiṭṭha region”. By these five, consummation is reached after leaving this world.</p>
