<p><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en5.1' href='#pts-vp-en5.1'>PTS vp En 5.1</a>1. There a certain person who acts and becomes remorseful, who does not know emancipation of mind and emancipation of insight as it really is, wherein his sinful and bad qualities which have arisen are totally destroyed, he should be told thus: “of the revered one the sinful tendencies which are due to actions exist, and the sinful tendencies which are due to remorsefulness increase. It were well if the revered one gave up sinful tendencies due to his actions and suppressed sinful tendencies due to remorse, and practised thought and insight”. Thus the revered one will become equal to the fifth person in this group.</p>
<p>There a certain person who acts and does not become remorseful, who does not know emancipation of mind and emancipation of insight as it really is, wherein his sinful and bad qualities which have arisen are destroyed, he should be told thus: “of the revered one the sinful tendencies due to actions exist and the sinful tendencies due to remorse do not increase. It were well if the revered one gave up sinful tendencies due to his actions, and practised thought and insight”. Thus the revered one will become equal to the fifth person in this group.</p>
<p>There a certain person who does not act, and [yet] becomes remorseful, who does not know emancipation of mind and emancipation of insight as it really is, wherein his sinful and bad qualities which have arisen are totally destroyed, he should be told thus: “of the revered one the sinful tendencies due to actions do not exist and the sinful tendencies due to remorsefulness increase. It were well if the revered one removed the sinful tendencies due to remorsefulness, and practised thought and insight”. Thus the revered one will become equal to the fifth person in this group.</p>
<p>There a person does not act and does not become remorseful, who does not know the emancipation of thought and emancipation of insight as it really is, whereby his sinful and bad qualities are totally destroyed, he should be told thus: “of the revered one the sinful tendencies due to actions do not exist and the sinful tendencies due to remorsefulness do not increase. It were well if the revered one practised thought and insight”. Thus the revered one will become equal to the fifth person in this group. These four persons being thus admonished, thus instructed by such a fifth man, gradually attain to the destruction of sinful tendencies.</p>
<p class='question'><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en5.2' href='#pts-vp-en5.2'>PTS vp En 5.2</a>2. How does a person who has given despise?</p>
<p>Here is a certain person to whom a person gives garment, food, alms-bowl, bed, seat, things necessary for the sick and medicine and requisites; to the latter it occurs thus: I give; this person, on the other hand, accepts. Giving this to him, he despises him; thus a person giving, despises.</p>
<p class='question'>How does a person despise by living together?</p>
<p>Here a certain person dwells with a person for two or three years; by living together with him he despises him; thus a person despises by living together.</p>
<p class='question'>How is a person a gape-mouth?</p>
<p>Here a certain person, while the praise or dispraise of a person is being uttered, becomes quickly infatuated about him; thus is a person a gape-mouth.</p>
<p class='question'>How does a person become a wobbler?</p>
<p>Here a certain person is of little faith, is of little devotion, is of little love, is of little contentment; thus a person becomes a wobbler.</p>
<p class='question'>How does a person become dull and stupid?</p>
<p>Here a certain person does not know good or bad qualities, does not know blameworthy or blameless qualities, does not know low or excellent qualities, does not know dark or bright qualities; thus a person becomes dull and stupid.</p>
<p class='question'><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en5.3' href='#pts-vp-en5.3'>PTS vp En 5.3</a>3. Who are there that are comparable to professional warriors?</p>
<p>There are five professional warriors: Here a certain professional warrior seeing the cloud of dust (raised by the march of the enemy) sinks down, becomes dejected, cannot control himself, is unable to go forward to fight; there is such a professional warrior. This is the first professional warrior existing in the world.</p>
<p>Again another: Here a certain professional warrior endures the cloud of dust, but seeing the top of the flag he sinks down, becomes dejected, cannot control himself, is unable to go forward to fight; there is such a professional warrior too. This is the second professional warrior existing in the world. Again another: Here a certain professional warrior endures the cloud of dust, endures the top of the flag; but hearing the war cries he sinks down, becomes dejected, cannot control himself, is unable to go forward to fight; there is such a professional warrior. This is the third professional warrior existing in the world.</p>
<p>Again another: Here a certain professional warrior endures the cloud of dust, endures the top of the flag, endures the war cries, but in the mêlée is killed and done for; there is such a professional warrior. This is the fourth professional warrior existing in the world. Again another: Here a certain professional warrior endures the cloud of dust, endures the top of the flag, endures war cries, endures the mêlée; winning the battle and victorious in the battle, he survives on the scene of the battle; there is such a professional warrior. This is the fifth professional warrior existing in the world.</p>
<p>These being the five professional warriors existing in the world, even so are these five persons who live and have their being among the monks comparable to professional warriors. Who are the five?</p>
<p>Here a certain monk seeing the cloud of dust, sinks down becomes remorseful, cannot control himself, is unable to develop the holy life, showing weakness in learning, giving up the precepts, he comes back to low household life.</p>
<p>What does dust mean for him? Here a monk hears that in such village or town lives a woman or a girl who is beautiful, charming to look at, delightful and endowed with great beauty; he listening to that sinks down, becomes remorseful, does not control himself, is unable to develop the holy life, showing weakness in learning, giving up the precepts, he comes back to low household life; this is what dust means for him. Just as a professional warrior seeing the dust sinks down, becomes remorseful, cannot control himself, is unable to go forward to fight, so is this person; there is such a person here. This person is the first existing in the world who is comparable to a professional warrior.</p>
<p>Again another: Here a certain monk endures the cloud of dust, but seeing the top of the flag sinks down, becomes remorseful, does not control himself, is unable to develop the holy life; showing weakness in learning, giving up precepts, he comes back to low household life.</p>
<p>What does the top of the flag mean for him? Here a monk does not only hear that in such a village or town lives a woman or a girl who is beautiful, charming to look at, delightful and endowed with great beauty; he himself sees the woman or the girl, who is beautiful, charming to look at, delightful, and endowed with great beauty; he seeing her sinks down, becomes remorseful, does not control himself, is unable to develop a holy life; showing weakness in learning, giving up the precepts, he comes back to low household life; this is what the top of the flag means for him. Just as the professional warrior endures the dust but seeing the top of the flag, sinks down, becomes remorseful, does not control himself, is unable to go forward to fight, so is this man; there is such a man here. This is the second person existing among the monks comparable to a professional warrior.</p>
<p>Again another: Here a certain monk endures the cloud of dust, endures the top of the flag, but hearing the war cries he sinks down, becomes remorseful, does not control himself, is unable to develop the life of purity; showing weakness in learning, giving up the precepts, he comes back to low household life.</p>
<p>What do war cries mean for him? Here a woman approaching a monk, who has gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty room, speaks lightly, converses, laughs and jests. He being spoken lightly to, or being conversed or jested with, or being ridiculed by the woman, sinks down, becomes remorseful, does not control himself, is unable to develop a holy life; showing weakness in learning, giving up the precepts, he comes back to low household life; this is what war cries mean for him. Just as that professional warrior withstands dust, withstands the top of the flag, hearing the war cries, sinks down, becomes remorseful, does not control himself, is unable to go forward to fight, so is this person; there is such a person here. This is the third person existing among the monks comparable to a professional warrior.</p>
<p>Again another: Here a certain monk endures the cloud of dust, endures the top of the flag, endures war cries, but is killed in the mêlée and is done for.</p>
<p>What does the mêlée mean for him? Here a woman approaching a monk who has gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty place sits near, lies down near, stretches her limbs fully; he having the woman sitting near him, having her lying down near him, having her stretching her limbs near him, gives up the precepts, and showing weakness, he misconducts himself. This is what the mêlée means for him. Just as that professional warrior endures dust, endures the top of the flag, endures war cries, but he is smitten and is done for, so is this person; there is such a person here. This is the fourth person existing among the monks comparable to a professional warrior.</p>
<p>Again another: Here a certain monk endures the cloud of dust, endures the top of the flag, endures war cries, and endures the mêlée; he winning the battle, being victorious, survives on the scene of battle.</p>
<p>What does the winning of battle mean for him? Here a woman approaching the monk, who has gone to the forest or to the foot of a tree or to an empty room, sits near, lies down near, stretches her limbs fully. He having the woman sitting near him, lying down near him, stretching her limbs fully near him, having extricated and having released himself goes away where he likes; he lives in a solitary place, in a forest, at the foot of a tree, in a mountain, in a cave, in a mountain grotto, in a cemetery, in a forest tract, in the open air or on a heap of straw: he having gone to the forest or at the foot of a tree or in an empty room sits cross-legged, placing the body erect and making recollection ready; he giving up covetousness in the world, lives with a mind free from covetousness, he purifies the mind of covetousness; giving up malice, he lives with a mind free from malice; being compassionate to all living beings, he purifies the mind of malice; giving up sloth and drowsiness, being conscious of light, mindful and possessed of knowledge, he purifies the mind of sloth and drowsiness; giving up distraction and restlessness, he purifies the mind of these, having his mind calm internally; giving up doubt, he lives having gone beyond doubt; being free from misgivings so far as good qualities are concerned, he purifies the mind of doubt; he giving up these five hindrances, which are the corrupters of mind, which weaken the intellect, free from sensual pleasures and bad qualities he lives in attainment of the first <i lang='pli' translate='no'>jhāna</i> (ecstatic meditation) which is with applied and sustained thought, and which has joy and happiness due to solitude; he, putting an end to applied and sustained thought, lives in attainment of the second, third, and fourth stages of ecstatic meditation.</p>
<p>He with such a concentrated mind, which is pure, which is clean, which is free from impurities, which is free from sins, which is soft, which can be acted upon, which is steadfast and which is immovable, by the knowledge of the destruction of sinful tendencies bends forth his mind; he knows truly that this is suffering, etc., … this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering; he knows truly that these are sinful tendencies, etc., … he understands truly that this is the path leading to the cessation of sinful tendencies. Thus knowing and seeing, his mind becomes emancipated from the tendency towards sensual pleasures, his mind becomes freed from the tendency towards rebirth, his mind becomes emancipated from the tendency towards ignorance; when it is freed, he has the knowledge that it is free, he knows that birth is exhausted, the holy life is led, what is to be done is done, and “there is nothing further of these conditions”. It is this that victory in battle means for him. Just as that professional warrior endures dust, endures the top of the flag, endures war cries, endures fight from a distance, he winning the battle, being victorious in the battle, survives on the scene of battle, so is this person; there is such a person here. This is the fifth person existing among the monks comparable to a professional warrior.</p>
<p>These are the five persons who live and have their being among the monks comparable to professional warriors.</p>
<p class='question'><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en5.4' href='#pts-vp-en5.4'>PTS vp En 5.4</a>4. There who are the five (persons) who live on alms?</p>
<p>One lives on alms because of his dullness and stupidity, one lives on alms because of sinful desire and moved by desire, one lives on alms because of madness and an unbalanced mind, one lives on alms because he thinks: it is praised by the Buddhas and their disciples; and, further, there is one who just because of absence of desire, just because of contentment, just because of eradication (of sin), and because [the life is] needed, lives on alms.</p>
<p>There the person who lives on alms just because of the absence of desire, just because of contentment, of eradication (of sin), and because [the life is] just; this is the head, the chief, the foremost, the best, and the most excellent of these five (persons) who live on alms. Just as the milk is from the cow, curds from milk, butter from curds, clarified butter (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>ghee</i>) from butter, and the scum of clarified butter from clarified butter (<i lang='pli' translate='no'>ghee</i>), so is this person who lives on alms because of these things the head, the chief, the foremost, the best, and the most excellent of five persons who live on alms.</p>
<p>These are the five persons who live on alms.</p>
<p class='question'><a class='ref pts-vp-en' id='pts-vp-en5.5' href='#pts-vp-en5.5'>PTS vp En 5.5</a>5–14. Who are the five persons who refuse to accept food after proper time?

Who are the five persons who are forest dwellers? Who are the five persons who live under a tree? Who are the five persons who live under the open sky? Who are the five persons who rest seated? (Who are the five persons who use any seats that are offered?) Who are the five persons who dwell in a cemetery?</p>
