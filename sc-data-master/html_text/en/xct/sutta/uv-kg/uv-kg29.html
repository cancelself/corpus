<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh40' href='#wrh40'>Rock 40</a>There is no swamp like desire <i lang='san' translate='no'>(trichnā)</i>; there is nothing as pernicious as hatred; there is no net like ignorance; there is no torrent like covetousness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh41' href='#wrh41'>Rock 41</a>The Śramana who has reached the other shore is like the trackless firmament; the fool delights in his occupations, and the Tathāgata is not his occupation.

<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh42' href='#wrh42'>Rock 42</a>The wise man destroys all attachments of gods and men, and by being free from all attachment he becomes emancipated from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh43' href='#wrh43'>Rock 43</a>From attachment proceeds existence; without attachment there is no existence: to the acquisition of the knowledge of these two ways of existence and not existence and the way to be perfectly delivered of attachment, let the wise man apply himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh44' href='#wrh44'>Rock 44</a>He who has done that which is wrong, suffers for it, and when hereafter he will be in the evil way he will suffer; he who has done that which is right, is made happy, and when hereafter he will be in the happy way he will be happy.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh45' href='#wrh45'>Rock 45</a>It is better in both <span class='add'>(this world and the other)</span> if one has not done evil, for he who does it will suffer; it is good for one to do what is right, for he will have no affliction.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh46' href='#wrh46'>Rock 46</a>The wise man and the fool being mixed together, it is not possible to distinguish them when they have not spoken; but let one of them impart <span class='add'>(the way)</span> to the perfection of peace <i lang='san' translate='no'>(nirvāṇa)</i>, then lie is known by his speech <span class='add'>(to be a sage)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh47' href='#wrh47'>Rock 47</a>The expounding <span class='add'>(of the law)</span> is the standard of the Rischi <i lang='san' translate='no'>(i.e., Bhagavat)</i>; the law being the standard of the Rischi, and the law by his explanations being made brilliant, let the Rischi raise on high his standard.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh48' href='#wrh48'>Rock 48</a>If one has not spoken he is blamed; if one has spoken much he is blamed; he who speaks slowly is blamed: there is no one in the world who is not blamed.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh49' href='#wrh49'>Rock 49</a>A man who is only to be blamed, or one who is only to be praised, there is none such; there never has been, there never will be.</p>

<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh52' href='#wrh52'>Rock 52</a>As mountains and rocks are unshaken by the wind, so likewise the wise man is unmoved by praise or blame.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh53' href='#wrh53'>Rock 53</a>The earnest man without any root in the earth, without a leaf <span class='add'>(of sinfulness)</span> on any branch, delivered from bondage, there is no one who can blame him.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh54' href='#wrh54'>Rock 54</a>He who does not suffer from conquest, whom the world cannot conquer in the least, the Buddha, the field of whose activity is infinite, there is no being by whose steps he is guided.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh55' href='#wrh55'>Rock 55</a> who does not suffer from conquest, whom the world cannot conquer in the least, the Buddha, whose might is infinite, there is no being by whose steps he is guided.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh56' href='#wrh56'>Rock 56</a>He to whom the allurements of desires and the regions of desire have no delight, the Buddha, the field of whose activity is infinite, there is no being by whose steps he is guided.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh57' href='#wrh57'>Rock 57</a>He to whom the allurements of desires and the region of desire have no delight, the Buddha, whose might is infinite, there is no being by whose steps he is guided.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh58' href='#wrh58'>Rock 58</a>He who is illumined by perfect understanding, who having fathomed everything abides in nothing, who is delivered of all attachments, of form, and consciousness <i lang='san' translate='no'>(sandjā)</i>, who has got rid of the four yogas, he has put an end to birth.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh59' href='#wrh59'>Rock 59</a>Having cast off what is before, having cast off what is behind, having cast off what is in the middle, one goes to the other shore of existence ; when the mind is free from everything, one will not be subject to birth and death.</p>
