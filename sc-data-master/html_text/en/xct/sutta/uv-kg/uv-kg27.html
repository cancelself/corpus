<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>It is easier to see the faults of others than those of oneself; the faults of others are easily seen, for they are sifted like chaff, but one's own faults are difficult to see. It is like the cheat who shows the dice <span class='add'>(of his adversary)</span> and hides his own, calling attention to the shortcomings of the other <span class='add'>(player)</span>, and continually thinking of accusing him; he is far from seeing what is right <i lang='san' translate='no'>(dharma)</i>, and greatly increases his unhappy lot.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>Life is easy for an impudent, thieving, boasting fellow, with filthy <span class='add'>(instincts?)</span> like a crow, who leads a life of sinfulness and impudicity.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>Life is hard for the man who is always seeking what is pure, who is disinterested, temperate, chaste, and modest.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>This world is in darkness; few there are who have spiritual insight, and who, like birds escaped from a net, go to enjoy the heavens.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>The fool who is held in bondage by his body is wrapped in darkness; they who covet worldly goods consider all other things in this same <span class='add'>(sinful)</span> way.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>Some think sentient beings are their own creators, some think that another <i lang='san' translate='no'>(Isvara, etc.)</i> made them; they who take as the truth what is not the truth can see nothing at all; not seeing that they are not even unanimous on this point, they cannot perceive misery.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>It enters not the mind of those beings who seek the pleasures of the senses that the misery they have until then seen <span class='add'>(brought on themselves)</span> is their own work; they do not understand that other like deeds will bring <span class='add'>(misery also with them)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>Those beings who are selfish, fond of selfishness, held in the bonds of selfishness, who are given to controversial opinions, will not escape from the orb of transmigration.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>Know that the <span class='add'>(births)</span> that one has been subject to, and those that he will be subject to, all of these are wrapped in sinfulness <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rāga)</i>; they are subject to decay.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>There are those who practise morality, the precepts, good behaviour, who lead a life of holiness <i lang='san' translate='no'>(brahmachariya)</i>, and there is an extreme which is to devote oneself to asceticism.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>And there is another extreme in which they say: “Desires are pure; though one has desires he is virtuous; desires are to be indulged in; desires have nothing sinful in them.” These men are swallowed up by their desires. <span class='add'>(The followers of)</span> both these extreme <span class='add'>(theories)</span>, frequenting mostly burial-places, are called “frequenters of burial-places” <i lang='san' translate='no'>(sosāniko)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>Neither of these extremes see <span class='add'>(the cause of suffering)</span>, so part of them are filled with desires, and part of them are wildly running about; they who can see perceive how full of desires they are, and how they run about.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>They who can see, perceive that if these two extremes could but see, they would give up desires and cease running <span class='add'>(after them)</span>; so they have no desires, and do not run about <span class='add'>(after them)</span>. As they do not thus, as they think not thus <span class='add'>(i.e., as the two extremes)</span>, as they are not held in this way, they have found the end of suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>He who looks on the world as a bubble, who considers it as a mirage, the king of death will not see him.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>He who looks on the body as a bubble, who considers it as a mirage, the king of death will not see him.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>Look always at this body as at a beautiful royal chariot; the fool delights in it, the wise man has no fondness for it.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>Look always at this body as at a beautiful royal chariot; the fool is deceived by it, the wise man is not deceived by it.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>Look always at this body as at a beautiful royal chariot; the fool is brought low through it, like an old elephant sunk in the mud.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>Look always at this body as sick and subject to decay, as a wounded man, as changing and impermanent.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh20' href='#wrh20'>Rock 20</a>Look at this body, ornamented with jewels, bracelets, and earrings, as diseased and subject to decay, as hanging and impermanent.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh21' href='#wrh21'>Rock 21</a>The fool in his stupidity adorns his curls, paints his eyes with collyr, and seeks not after the other world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh22' href='#wrh22'>Rock 22</a>The fool in his stupidity paints <span class='add'>(his body)</span> with colours, covers with jewels this corrupt body, and seeks not after the other world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh23' href='#wrh23'>Rock 23</a>The fool in his stupidity anoints this body with perfumes, rubs his feet with gerika, and seeks not after the other world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh24' href='#wrh24'>Rock 24</a>He who is entirely devoted to desires, and who sees not the sinfulness of his devotion, is unable through his devotion to desires to cross the wide and eternal stream.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh25' href='#wrh25'>Rock 25</a>He who has commenced by casting off the principal desires, and finally all of them, who looks neither to the I or the mine, crosses the until then impassable stream, and finishes with existence.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh26' href='#wrh26'>Rock 26</a>He who having freed himself of the forest, being without the forest, runs to the forest, though he has freed himself of it ; look at that miserable man who gives up freedom for bondage!</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh27' href='#wrh27'>Rock 27</a>Look at that sinless being, agreeable <span class='add'>(to look at)</span> in every limb, with a chariot well made <span class='add'>(down to)</span> the spokes, <span class='add'>(see her)</span> clothed in a white gown, and free yourself of the stream of bondage.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh28' href='#wrh28'>Rock 28</a>The common of men, driven by fear, seek a refuge in mountains, forests, groves, sacrificial places, and in great trees.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh29' href='#wrh29'>Rock 29</a>These are not the best of refuges, these are not the chief refuges, for a man who goes to them for a refuse is not freed from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh30' href='#wrh30'>Rock 30</a>He who seeks a refuge in the Buddha, the law <i lang='san' translate='no'>(dharma)</i>, and the church <i lang='san' translate='no'>(sangha)</i>, <span class='add'>(he who sees with understanding)</span> suffering, the production of suffering, the destruction of suffering:</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh31' href='#wrh31'>Rock 31</a>He who sees with understanding happiness, the way to nirvāṇa, the eightfold holy way and the four blessed truths:</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh32' href='#wrh32'>Rock 32</a>This is the chief refuge, this is the holy refuge; he who goes to this refuge, becomes freed from all suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh33' href='#wrh33'>Rock 33</a>He who perceives <span class='add'>(mentally)</span> what he sees, can perceive also the unseen with his sight; he who sees not the unseen does not perceive what he ought to see; ordinary sight and spiritual insight <i lang='san' translate='no'>(vipassanā)</i> are by their nature as different as day and night, which never are at the same time.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh34' href='#wrh34'>Rock 34</a>With ordinary sight one cannot perceive <span class='add'>(suffering, etc.)</span>; if one sees, he loses sight of form <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rūpa)</i>; with this sight <i lang='san' translate='no'>(i.e., vipassanā)</i> one perceives not form; with ordinary sight one is without perceiving anything.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh35' href='#wrh35'>Rock 35</a>He who perceives nothing, sees <span class='add'>(but)</span>, form; he who perceives sees not form; thus they who perceive not form have freed themselves of ordinary sight <span class='add'>(i.e., have obtained vipassanā)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh36' href='#wrh36'>Rock 36</a>When one perceives not suffering, then he considers but the self <span class='add'>(i.e., he has ordinary sight)</span>; but when one distinguishes suffering, then he perceives not form.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh37' href='#wrh37'>Rock 37</a>He who is in the midst of darkness of repeated regeneration perceives not the suffering of the sanskāra, consequently he has but ordinary sight, and does not perceive how to put an end to form.</p>
