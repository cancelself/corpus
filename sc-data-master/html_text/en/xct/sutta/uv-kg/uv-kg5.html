<h1><span class='add'>5. Agreeable Things</span></h1>
</header>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>From those things that are agreeable comes sorrow; from those things that are agreeable comes fear: if one casts off agreeable things he will be without sorrow, without fear.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>From that which is enjoyable comes fear; from the agreeable comes misery, from the agreeable fear: if that which is pretty changes, one reaps but despair.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>The miseries of the world are numerous—sorrow, lamentations, cries, etc.; they all arise from holding on to those things that are agreeable: if one gives up what is agreeable they will all cease to be.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>They for whom there is nothing whatever agreeable in the world are happy and without sorrow; they therefore who would be without affliction, free from human passions, must never do that which is agreeable.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>Not to see what is agreeable is painful, so likewise is the sight of what is not agreeable; one must never seek what is agreeable; he must not seek what is not agreeable.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>It is by being deprived of what is agreeable and by finding what is disagreeable that men create <span class='add'>(for themselves)</span> the intolerable sorrow of age.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>When that in which one delights does die, such as one's kinsfolk or friends, it brings one a great and enduring sorrow, for to be separated from that which brings pleasure is painful.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>He who knows neither agreeable or disagreeable is without bonds; he, therefore, who considers the agreeable as sinful will give up what is agreeable.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>He who, having ceased to consider what is agreeable, has nought to do with attachment to <span class='add'>(worldly)</span> happiness, who has attachment to the happiness that is not that of the individual, seeks the object of his fond desires <i lang='san' translate='no'>(nirvāṇa)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>He who among gods and men is held by fondness for what is pleasing in the body <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rūpa)</i>, does evil and suffers affliction, he falls into the power of age and death.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>He who is steadfast both by day and night, who casts away what is pleasing in the body <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rūpa)</i>, which is difficult to do, pulls up by the very roots sin, that food of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>The foolish people, who consider what is not good as good, what is not agreeable as agreeable, what is misery as happiness, will surely come to destruction.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>He who, doing evil, would be made happy by it, finds no contentment, let him not do evil.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>He who, doing what is right, would be made happy by it, finds contentment, let him not do evil.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>As the frontier town is protected by strong retrenchments, so let him who would be happy protect himself by strong defences.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>The wise man who would be made happy watches during all the three watches; his watchfulness makes him safe.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>When the frontier town is well guarded within and without, its peace is not disturbed: do likewise and watch thyself; for when one has been born in hell his peace is gone and he repents him <span class='add'>(of what he has left undone)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>Look where you will, there is nothing dearer to man than himself; therefore, as it is the same thing that is dear to you and to others, hurt not others with what pains yourself.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh20' href='#wrh20'>Rock 20</a>To all men this life is dear; all men fear punishment; you, who are like unto them, strike not, put not to death.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh21' href='#wrh21'>Rock 21</a>He who has been to a great distance and who returns from afar without mishap, his assembled kinsfolk and friends receive him with joyful cries of “Alala!”</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh22' href='#wrh22'>Rock 22</a>So likewise he who has been virtuous, on arriving from this world into another, his good works receive him like kinsfolk and welcome him.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh23' href='#wrh23'>Rock 23</a>Lay up, therefore, good works in view of the other world; for it is good works that receive beings in the other world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh24' href='#wrh24'>Rock 24</a>He whose life is one of virtue is praised by the gods; he in whom there is nothing to be blamed finds perfect joy in heaven.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh25' href='#wrh25'>Rock 25</a>He who observes the law, who is perfectly virtuous, modest, speaking the truth, doing what he ought to do, delights the rest of mankind.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh26' href='#wrh26'>Rock 26</a>He who, doing what he ought to do, and who, extolling the true law, gives to others pleasure, shall find joy in the other world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh27' href='#wrh27'>Rock 27</a>His speech is edifying, and he has given up all wrong doings, in this delights the righteous, and delights not the unrighteous.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh28' href='#wrh28'>Rock 28</a>Therefore what is good and what is not good are separated at death; the unrighteous go to hell, the righteous go to heaven.</p>
