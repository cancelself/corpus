<h1><span class='add'>14. Hatred</span></h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>Hatred towards those who do no evil and who do not hate, this is the sign <span class='add'>(lit. garment)</span> of the sinner in this world and in the other.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>After having brought misery on himself, he would afterwards bring trouble to others, like unto the hunting hawk, <span class='add'>(?)</span> who, captive himself, does injury to others.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>He who smites will be smitten; he who shows rancour will find rancour; so likewise from reviling comes reviling, and to him who is angered comes anger.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>Those foolish śramanas who know not the holy law, though this life be brief, in the foolishness of their hearts they give themselves to wrangling.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>“This is the best <span class='add'>(man)</span>,” they think, being thus at variance with the unanimous opinion: “Why does the clergy choose this man? he is without strength and without mind.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>If a bone is broken, <span class='add'>(they advise)</span> killing, carrying off horses, cattle, and riches, subduing kingdoms, and then afterwards to become friends again.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7-8' href='#wrh7-8'>Rock 7-8</a>But the wise man, who knows what is <span class='add'>(right)</span>, says: “Why do you not learn this law, which teaches the real way to live?” <span class='add'>(lit. field of activity)</span>. You who have not the conduct of sages, watch carefully over the words of your mouth; guard those of your neighbours who do not know <span class='add'>(the danger they may run)</span>; they who know <span class='add'>(this law)</span>, speak soft-toned pleasing words.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>“He abused me, he reviled me, he beat me, he subdued me;” he who keeps this in his mind, and who feels resentment, will find no peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>“He abused me, he reviled me, he beat me, he subdued me;” he who keeps not this in his mind, and is not resentful, will find peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>He who shows hatred to those who hate will never be at peace; he who is patient with those who hate will find peace; this is the spirit of religion.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>He who bears ill-will to those who bear ill-will can never become pure; but he who feels no ill-will, pacifies them who hate: as hatred brings misery to mankind, the sage knows no hatred.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>If a man find a wise companion, who is both steadfast and pure, let him, having overcome all corruption, associate with him, thoughtful and glad.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>If a man find not a wise companion, who is both steadfast and pure, like a king abandoning his broad kingdom, let him live alone and commit no sin.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>If a man find not a good friend who leads a life like unto his own, let him resolutely keep a solitary life, and not associate with a fool.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>It is better to live a lonely life than to have companionship with the fool; casting off all taxation of mind, one lives alone, like the elephant of the Mātanga forest.</p>
