<h1><span class='add'>2. Desire (Kāma)</span></h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>All indecision produces desires; it is called the root of desire; suppress indecision and <i lang='san' translate='no'>(desire)</i> will arise in thee no more.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>From desires comes grief, from desires comes fear; he who is free from desires knows neither grief nor fear.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>From pleasures comes grief, from pleasures comes fear; he who is free from pleasures knows neither grief nor fear.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>The fruit of desires and pleasures ripens into sorrow; their at first agreeable fruit is burning, as the torch that has not been cast away does finally burn the fool.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>Look at those who are fondly attached to jewels, earrings, to their children <i lang='san' translate='no'>(those are fetters)</i>; but iron, wood, and rope make not strong fetters, says the Blessed One.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>It is hard for one who is held by the fetters of desire to free himself of them, says the Blessed One. The steadfast, who care not for the happiness of desires, cast them off, and do soon depart <span class='add'>(to nirvāna)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>There is no being in the world who is not through his indecision affected by desires, yet they who are steadfast seek to free themselves of desires, though they do pervade the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>Mankind has no lasting desires; they are impermanent in them who experience them: free yourselves then from what cannot last, and abide not in the sojourn of death.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>The sinless and reflective mind in which a desire arises experiences no misery from it; the different desires disturb it not: he who <span class='add'>(has such a mind)</span> is beyond death, I declare.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>As the smith does with the silver, so does the intelligent man, gradually and little by little, cleanse himself of all his impurities.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>As the shoemaker, when he has well prepared his leather, can use it to make shoes, so when one has cast off desires, he has the highest happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>If one longs for happiness, let him cast off all desires; he who has cast off all desires will find the most perfect happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>As long as one follows after desire, one finds no satisfaction; they who through wisdom have given it up find contentment.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>Desires are never satiated; wisdom affords contentment: he who has the contentment of wisdom cannot fall into the power of lust.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>They who have fondness for pleasure, and who delight only in what is wrong, would not perceive the danger they run, even if their life were drawing to a close.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>The evil-minded is subdued by wealth and seeks not after the other world; his mind is subverted by his fondness for desires; he brings destruction on himself and on others.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>Even a shower of Karśapanas would not satisfy the covetous; the wise know full well that desires bring little contentment and <span class='add'>(much)</span> pain.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>Not even in the pleasures of the gods does the disciple of the perfect Buddha find pleasure; he rejoices only in the destruction of desires.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>Even a mountain of riches like unto Himavat would not suffice for the wealth of a single man; he who has understanding knows this full well.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh20' href='#wrh20'>Rock 20</a>They who know that this <span class='add'>(i.e., desire)</span> is the origin of sorrow, how can they delight in pleasures? Having learnt that this is the cause of pain in the world, they acquire steadfastness to help to control themselves.</p>
