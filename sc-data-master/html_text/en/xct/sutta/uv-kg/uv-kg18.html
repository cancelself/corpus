<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>Who is there that can overcome the world of the gods, of the lord of death <i lang='san' translate='no'>(Yama)</i> and of men, who knows how to expose the most delightful law, as one would flowers?</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>It is the disciple <i lang='san' translate='no'>(sekhas)</i> who can overcome the world of the gods, of the lord of death and of men, who knows how to expose the most delightful law, as one would flowers.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>Fear is born of the forest <span class='add'>(of ignorance)</span>; so cut down not <span class='add'>(only)</span> the trees of the forest, but all that appertains to the forest <span class='add'>(i.e., the roots)</span>, and then the Śramana will find nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>If man destroys not everything that appertains to the forest down to the smallest part, his mind will be held in bondage, as the calf that wants milk is to its mother's side.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>Cut out the love of self as you would an autumn lotus; cherish the road of peace on account of the nirvāṇa which the Victorious One has explained.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>Like a pretty flower, of pleasing colour but without scent, are the agreeably spoken but fruitless words of one who does not act <span class='add'>(accordingly)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>As the bee, which harms neither the colour nor the scent of the flower, but having sucked it flies away, so let the Muni walk through a village.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>Remarking not the sins of others, and what they have done or left undone, one should remark what he himself does right or wrong.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>As on piles of filth and in dirty water grows, unaffected by them, the padma, pure, sweet-smelling, and lovely.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>So the disciple of the perfect Buddha shines by his wisdom among other men, who are blind and <span class='add'>(like)</span> a heap of filth.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>As out of a heap of flowers many garlands are made, so when a man has been born he can do many virtuous deeds.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>As the vakula plant in summer sheds all its flowers, so let the Bhixu drop passions, hatred, and ignorance.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>A man whose mind is troubled, like one gathering flowers, the lord of death carries him off as the flood does a sleeping village.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>A man whose mind is troubled, like one gathering flowers, falls into the power of the lord of death without having satisfied his desires.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>A man whose mind is troubled, like one gathering: flowers, falls into the power of the lord of death without him having acquired wealth <span class='add'>(enough to satisfy him)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>A man whose mind is troubled, like one gathering flowers, falls into the power of the lord of death without having arrived at the object of his pursuit.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>He who has perceived that this body is <span class='add'>(empty)</span> as a vase, and who knows that all things <i lang='san' translate='no'>(dharma)</i> are as an illusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>He who has perceived that this world is like froth, and who knows that all things are as an illusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>He who has perceived that this body is like froth, and who knows that all things are as an illusion, does thus destroy the chief of Māra's flowers, and will no more be seen by the king of death.</p>

<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh21' href='#wrh21'>Rock 21</a>The Bhixu who knows that existence is without reality, like an udumbāra flower, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh22' href='#wrh22'>Rock 22</a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of passion, as one does the flower from the water-born <span class='add'>(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh23' href='#wrh23'>Rock 23</a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of hatred, as one does the flower from the water-born <span class='add'>(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh24' href='#wrh24'>Rock 24</a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of ignorance, as one does the flower of the water-born <span class='add'>(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh25' href='#wrh25'>Rock 25</a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of egotism, as one does the flower of the water-born <span class='add'>(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh26' href='#wrh26'>Rock 26</a>The Bhixu who cuts of every particle of affection, as one does the flower of the water-born <span class='add'>(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh27' href='#wrh27'>Rock 27</a>The Bhixu who cuts off every particle of desire, as one does the flower of the water-born <span class='add'>(lotus)</span> growing in a tank, casts off what is and is not of the other shore, as a snake shuffles off his old dried-up skin.</p>
