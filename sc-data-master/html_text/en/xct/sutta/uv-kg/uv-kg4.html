<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>The pure man knows not death ; he who is impure dwells with death; he who is pure will not die; he who is impure dies repeatedly.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>The wise who know this difference delight in modesty and purity; their pleasure is that of the elect.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>With this <span class='add'>(idea)</span> incessantly present to their minds, and always firm in their resolution to gain the other side, they <span class='add'>(finally)</span> enjoy nirvāṇa, that unsurpassable felicity.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>When the wise men through earnestness have overcome heedlessness, then, steadfast through wisdom, they ascend to above the abode of the gods, and, free from sorrow and pain, they look down as from the summit of a mountain at the fools on the face of the earth.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>The wise man through earnestness, virtue, and purity makes himself an island which no flood can submerge.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>'Tis the earnest that become far-famed by their diligence, reflection, the purity of their lives, their judgment, their perfect observance <span class='add'>(of the commandments)</span>, by their whole life which is according to the law.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>One must apply oneself to acquire superior insight and the foundation of the condition of the Muni. He who is wrapped up in his uninterrupted thoughts of peace knows no sorrow <i lang='san' translate='no'>(ṇibbuta)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>Have nothing to do with false doctrines, have nothing to do with the heedless; he who delights not in false theories shall not continue <span class='add'>(in)</span> the world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>He who has correct ideas of the world shall acquire such greatness, that though he goes through a thousand regenerations, he shall not fall into the evil way.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>The <span class='add'>(mind of the)</span> fool who is given up to carelessness is perverted; the wise man must be careful, as is the head of a caravan watching his treasures.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>He who is not given up to carelessness, who finds no delight in pleasures, whose mind is always attentive, will put an end to sorrow.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>He who has put an end to sorrow, and is not given to carelessness in this world, can no more be hurt by the careless than can the lion by the antelope.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>The shameless man who covets his neighbour's wife will experience these four conditions: he acquires <span class='add'>(bad)</span> reputation, troubled sleep, thirdly scorn, and fourthly he goes to hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>He who, acting not virtuously, doeth evil, indulges but for a moment, amidst fear and trembling, his burning passion, and then he has to bear the heavy punishment of the king, and he is burnt in hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>He who seeks after happiness, let him act vigorously; the steadfast makes no slothful exertions like those of the foolish waggoners.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>When the fools with their waggons have given up the highroad and have entered a bad road, they deeply grieve over their mistake.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>In like manner, the fool who gives up the law and follows that which is not the law falls into the power of the lord of death; he also is destroyed by reason of his want of sight.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>They who do not what ought to be done, and who do that which ought not to be done, who glory in their carelessness, increase the extent of their troubles, and he who adds to his misery finds its cessation a long way off.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>He who comprehends the nature of the body, who reflects, and whose exertions are unceasing, does not what ought not to be done, and does what ought to be done.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh20' href='#wrh20'>Rock 20</a>He, therefore, with memory and understanding will put an end to his misery, and when he has put an end to his misery <i lang='san' translate='no'>(asrava)</i>, he will find the untroubled state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh21' href='#wrh21'>Rock 21</a>As many as you be, I declare unto you that those who, though they have heard but little of the law, have followed its commandments, have understood the law; they who follow the law have understood the law.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh22' href='#wrh22'>Rock 22</a>Even if the careless man can recite a large portion <span class='add'>(of the law)</span>, he follows it not; he is like a cowherd counting the cattle of others; he has no share in the priesthood.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh23' href='#wrh23'>Rock 23</a>He who, though he can only recite a few lines <span class='add'>(of the law)</span>, walks in the path of the law, and has forsaken passion, anger, and ignorance, he has a share in the priesthood.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh24' href='#wrh24'>Rock 24</a>He whose speech exalts earnestness and who always despises heedlessness will be greater among the gods than he who has made a hundred sacrifices.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh25' href='#wrh25'>Rock 25</a>The sage who praises earnestness in his speech knows what is right and what is wrong; the sage holds fast to earnestness for two reasons: for the blessings it brings this life, and also on account of the future; the steadfast who have understood this are called sages.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh26' href='#wrh26'>Rock 26</a>The Bhixu who delights in purity and who looks with dread on impurity will pull himself from out the evil way as the elephant pulls himself from out the mire.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh27' href='#wrh27'>Rock 27</a>The Bhixu who delights in purity and who looks with dread on impurity shakes off sin as does the wind the leaves of a tree.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh28' href='#wrh28'>Rock 28</a>The Bhixu who delights in purity and who looks with dread on impurity puts an end to all attachments and gradually arrives at felicity.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh29' href='#wrh29'>Rock 29</a>The Bhixu who delights in purity and who looks with dread on impurity arrives at perfect comprehension of rest from the sanskāra, the perfection of peace.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh30' href='#wrh30'>Rock 30</a>The Bhixu who delights in purity and who looks with dread on impurity is so near nirvāṇa that he cannot fail <span class='add'>(to reach it)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh31' href='#wrh31'>Rock 31</a>The diligent and virtuous man, who lives according to the law, finds by following the law happiness in this world and in the other.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh32' href='#wrh32'>Rock 32</a>Ye who are earnest in learning for the sake of rest <i lang='san' translate='no'>(nirvāṇa)</i>, exerting yourselves and filled with application, consider well the lives of those unreflecting, careless, negligent, uncontrolled, and lazy men who have turned away from learning, and hearken not to the unreflecting.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh33' href='#wrh33'>Rock 33</a>The Bhixu who is truly moral and who delights in earnestness brings thus all his thoughts well under control, and his mind is in safety.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh34' href='#wrh34'>Rock 34</a>Arise, commence a new life, turn towards the doctrine of the Buddha; trample down the hosts of the lord of death as an elephant does a house of mud.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh35' href='#wrh35'>Rock 35</a>Whoever has lived according to this law of discipline, in gentleness and purity, will, having cast off transmigration, put an end to his misery.</p>
