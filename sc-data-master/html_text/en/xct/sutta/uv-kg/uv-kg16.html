<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>When you feel inclined to do a thing, commence by examining it: “If I had only done thus at first, one wishes when it is too late.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>“I would have seen the real nature of desire, and that it becomes a fetter;” let one watch what he does as long as he is striving after perfection.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>By application and diligence one will make oneself an island. Remove thine impurities as does the smith those of the silver: thine impurities removed and free from sin, thou shalt find no more birth and old age.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a> <span class='add'>(316, 317)</span>. He who is ashamed of what is not shameful, and not ashamed of what is shameful, who fears what is not fearful, and who fears not what is fearful, that man has wrong views and will be lost.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>He who formerly was heedless and who afterwards has become careful, like the moon free from clouds, he brightens up the whole world.</p>

<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>He who covers up his evil deeds by good deeds brightens up the whole of this world like the moon free from clouds.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>He who covers up his evil deeds by good deeds will by reflecting leave behind him the desires of this world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>He who delights not in life, finds no sorrow in death; he knows the reward of earnestness, and is without pain even in the midst of sorrow.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>He who delights not in life finds no sorrow in death: he knows the reward of earnestness, and is a shining light to the rest of his relatives.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>The Bhixu who by meditating on virtue has cast off sin leaves his home for a homeless condition, which is the true field of activity, and then, having learnt what is real joy, he casts off every desire.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>One whose heart is always pure, pure by always confessing his sins, in every act observing the way of purity, will reach perfection.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>'Tis weeds that do damage a field, 'tis passions that damage mankind; he therefore who gives to them who are without passions will receive a great reward.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>'Tis weeds that do damage a field, 'tis hatred that does damage mankind; he therefore who gives to them who are without hatred will receive a great reward.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>'Tis weeds that do damage a field, 'tis ignorance that does damage mankind; he therefore who gives to them who are without ignorance will receive a great reward.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>'Tis weeds that do damage a field, 'tis selfishness that does damage mankind; he therefore who gives to them who are without selfishness will receive a great reward.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>'Tis weeds that do damage a field, 'tis lust that does damage mankind; he therefore who gives to them who are without lust will receive a great reward.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh20' href='#wrh20'>Rock 20</a>'Tis weeds that do damage a field, 'tis desire <i lang='san' translate='no'>(trīchnā)</i> that does damage mankind; he therefore who gives to them who are without desires will receive a great reward.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh21' href='#wrh21'>Rock 21</a><span class='add'>(These)</span> six are lord and master. If one is given to passion <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rāga)</i>, he has <span class='add'>(all)</span> the passions; if one is without passion <i lang='san' translate='no'>(rāga)</i>, he is without <span class='add'>(any of)</span> the passions. He who is passionate is called a fool.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh22' href='#wrh22'>Rock 22</a>When a citadel has been made of bones, plastered over with flesh and blood, passion, hatred, and selfishness dwell together in it.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh23' href='#wrh23'>Rock 23</a>They who do not perceive the source from whence comes all their misery are held in bondage; they who have found it out leave the waters <span class='add'>(of sin)</span> and cross over to the other side, where they are free from passions.</p>
