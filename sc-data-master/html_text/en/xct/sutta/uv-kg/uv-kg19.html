<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>If a good horse is struck with a whip, he is frightened and exerts himself with all his strength; so likewise when one is full of faith, morality, and meditation <i lang='san' translate='no'>(samādhi)</i>, having never aught to do with the phenomenal world <i lang='san' translate='no'>(dharma)</i>, having his senses well composed, patient, and glad, thus goaded on he leaves the world completely behind.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>If a good horse is struck with a whip, he is frightened and exerts himself with all his strength; so likewise when one is full of faith, morality, and meditation, having never aught to do with the phenomenal world, having knowledge and <span class='add'>(observing)</span> the fundamental <span class='add'>(rules)</span>, thus goaded on he casts away every particle of misery.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>They who are well subdued, like well-broken horses, whose senses are so well controlled as to keep down anger, putting thus an end to sorrow, these Munis will soon be rejoicing among the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>The pure man has no intercourse with the careless, the vigilant with the slothful, as the good horse who is wise leaves the wild horses and wanders <span class='add'>(alone)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>He who minds modesty and knowledge as a good horse does the whip, and who is well composed by wisdom, cleanses himself of sin.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>The tamed <span class='add'>(horse)</span> is made to go to the place of assembly; the king rides the tamed <span class='add'>(horse)</span>; the best among tamed men is he who patiently endures abuse.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>Better than the largest of elephants, than thoroughbred Sindhu horses, than well-broken mules, is he who tames himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>With one's own well-tamed self one can reach peace, but with these other modes of conveyance it is not possible to reach that state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>Better than the largest of elephants, than thoroughbred Sindhu horses, than well-broken mules, is he who tames himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>With one's own well-tamed self one can arrive at the end of affliction, but with these other modes of conveyance it is not possible to reach that state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>Better than the largest of elephants, than thoroughbred Sindhu horses, than well-broken mules, is he who tames himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>With one's own well-tamed self one can cast off humanity, but with these other modes of conveyance it is not possible to reach that state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>Better than the largest of elephants, than thoroughbred Sindhu horses, than well-broken mules, is he who tames himself.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>With one's own well-tamed self one will depart, having severed one's bonds, but with these other modes of conveyance it is not possible to reach that state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>He who would be tamed like a good horse must tame himself; with the self well tamed one reaches the end of affliction.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>Self is the lord of self; self is the refuge of self: therefore break the self as you would a good horse.</p>
