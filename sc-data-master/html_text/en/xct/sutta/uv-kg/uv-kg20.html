<h1><span class='add'>20. Anger</span></h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>When one has cast off anger, cast off selfishness, leaving behind every description of bondage, without any fondness for name and form, free from everything, he cannot fall into the way of passions.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>Casting away rising anger, casting away the passions as soon as they show themselves, the steadfast man casting away all ignorance, will find happiness in the perception of the truth.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>If one has cast away anger, his sleep is peaceful; if one has cast away anger, he knows no sorrow. Bhixus, destroy anger, which is the root of the poison; the elect declare that they who have overcome it, are without sorrow.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>“There is nothing better than to master one's anger.” This is a great saying, for pain comes after anger, as it does when one has been burnt with fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>He who is not chaste, without modesty, who gives way to anger, who is without restraint, he who is thus subdued by passion, who is there that cares for him?</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>He who has but the strength of the ignorant has a strength which is not one. It is not likely that the fool who knows nothing of the law can attain perfection.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>He who having strength is patient with those who are weak, him I call the most patient of men, submitting always to the opinions of the weak.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>He who, though he is lord over others, is patient with those who are weak, him I call the most patient of men, submitting always to the opinions of the weak.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>He who, having been chided, is patient though he be strong, him I call the most patient of men, submitting always to the opinions of the weak.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>He who, knowing that his enemy is angered, remains peaceful himself, preserves himself and others from great dangers.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>He who, knowing that his enemy is angered, remains peaceful himself, does that which is beneficial both to himself and to the other.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>He who acts thus for the benefit of himself and others, they who know not the law, lightly think “He is a fool!”</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>The words of the superior man are patient through fear <span class='add'>(of the consequences)</span>; the patience that endures abuse and provocations, which endures humiliating words, that patience is the best, the sage says.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>The fool who is angered and who thinks to triumph by using abusive language, is always vanquished by him whose words are patient.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>Speak the truth; yield not to anger; give to him who begs, even though it be but a little: by living up to these three <span class='add'>(rules of conduct)</span> thou wilt go to the abode of the gods.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>He who is overcome by anger sees not what is good for himself; if you would free yourself of transmigration, speak not angry words.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>He who, having been angered, gives way to anger again, is sinful; but he who, having been angered, gives way to it no more, has won a mighty victory.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>Overcome anger by not being angered; overcome evil by good; overcome avarice by liberality; overcome falsehoods by truth.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>He who is controlled and who leads a righteous life, by what could he be angered? The wise, who have perfect wisdom and who are emancipated, are without anger.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh20' href='#wrh20'>Rock 20</a>The elect associate always with him who is without anger, without wickedness; they who are wicked and given to anger <span class='add'>(live alone)</span>, weighed down as if by a mountain.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh21' href='#wrh21'>Rock 21</a>He who holds in rising anger, as he would guide a chariot on the road, him I call an accomplished driver; the vulgar crowd only hold the reins.</p>
