<h1><span class='add'>11. The Śramana</span></h1>

<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>Cast off desires, O Brāhmana, stop the stream <span class='add'>(of birth)</span> by thy earnestness; he who is not able to cast away all desires cannot find the one <span class='add'>(perfect state)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>The irresolute and careless Parivrādjakas only heap up sins again and again; he who is diligent and earnest knows how to do that which ought to be done.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>An irresolute act, badly performed penance, an unrighteous life, bring no great profit.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>If an arrow is badly grasped, it cuts the hand; the Śramana who performs his duties badly is on the way to hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>If an arrow is properly grasped, it does not cut the hand; in like manner, the Śramana who exactly performs his duties is on the way to nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>The ignorant Śramana, who finds it hard to cross <span class='add'>(the stream)</span>, hard to be patient, who is filled with the many sorrows that his faint-heartedness brings him:</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>The Śramana whose life is like this, is subject to the ever-recurring grief, of which he cannot free himself, of one who is filled with indecision.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>He who is a bad priest, who delights in sin, and who, as a layman, is given to sinful deeds, addicted to everything that is bad, he lays up for himself the wretchedness of regeneration.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>Many of those who wear the patched saffron-coloured gown are unrestrained and delight in wickedness; these bad men go to perdition.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>He who, breaking all his vows, <span class='add'>(is held)</span> as is a sāla-tree by a creeper, brings himself to that state to which his enemy would like to bring him.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>Though one's hair may be grey, one is not for that reason admitted among the elders; he has reached old age, but he is called “Old-in-vain.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>He who is virtuous, who has cast off sin, who is a Bramachārin, and free of all <span class='add'>(impurities)</span>, he is called “an elder.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>He whose conduct is bad and who speaks lies, though his head be shaven, is not a Śramana. They who live in ignorance and lust, how can they be Śramanas?</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>He whose conduct is bad and who speaks lies, though his head be shaven, is not a Śramana ; he who has “quieted” sin, him the wise know to be a Śramana.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>He whose conduct is bad and who speaks lies, though his head be shaven, is not a Śramana; but he who, having distinguished all sins, great and small, does keep away from them and does “quiet” sin, he is called “a Śramana.”</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>He who has “cast off sin” is a Brāhmana ; he who does “quiet” sin is a Śramana; he who has cast off all his impurities is for that reason called a priest.</p>
