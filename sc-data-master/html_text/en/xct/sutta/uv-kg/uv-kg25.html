<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>The wise man should not know him who is without faith, who is avaricious, who stirs up strife, and who slanders; he should not associate with the wicked.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>The wise man should have as his friends those who have faith, who speak pleasingly, who are attentive, virtuous, and wise; he should associate with the best of men.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>Do not keep sinful persons as associates, stay not with the wicked; keep virtuous friends, stay with righteous men. If one associates with such as these, he becomes not sinful, but righteous.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>Associate with them who have listened much, retained much, who reflect, who have faith and wisdom; if one but hearken here to the pleasing words <span class='add'>(of these men)</span>, he will attain that which surpasses everything.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>He who associates with what is low is contaminated by <span class='add'>(their)</span> sinfulness; he who associates with what is entirely fallen is held down to earth; associating with what is best brings one to righteousness. Keep then to those who will raise you to excellence.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>If one associates with those best of men who are virtuous, dispassionate, who have the best of knowledge, though one be good, one will arrive at still greater excellence.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>It is with him who associates with the sinful as with the sweet kuśa grass in which a man wrapped up some decayed fish; the kuśa also became decayed.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>It is with him who associates with the virtuous as with the palāśa leaves in which a man wrapped up some incense <i lang='san' translate='no'>(tagara)</i>; the leaves also became scented.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>If those who are not wicked associate with the wicked, there arises an inclination to do evil, which will grow into open acts of wickedness: by associating with those with whom one ought not to associate, one becomes sinful through their sinfulness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>As when an arrow has been dipped in poison, even where the poison has not come in contact with it, it is poisonous, so are those who are clothed in sin, that source of terror: keep not wicked friends.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>As are one's associates, as is what one holds fast to, so will one become in a short while: examine well, then, whom you associate with, as you would a basket of fruit.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>Not associating with the unrighteous, the wise man associates with the righteous; by following this road the Bhixu will find the end of misery.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>If a fool for the whole of his life be associated with a wise man, he will no more perceive the law than does a spoon the taste of soup.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>If an intelligent man be associated for an instant with a wise man, he will perceive the law as does the tongue the taste of soup.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>If a fool for the whole of his life be associated with a wise man, as he has no eyes he will not perceive the law.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>If an intelligent man be only for an instant associated with a wise man, he, having eyes, will perceive the law.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>If a fool for the whole of his life be associated with a wise man, he will not understand the law taught by the perfect Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>If an intelligent man be only associated for an instant with a wise man, he will understand the law taught by the perfect Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>A single significant word suffices for him who is wise; all the teaching of the Buddha would not suffice for the fool.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh20' href='#wrh20'>Rock 20</a>He who is intelligent will with one word know a hundred; the fool with a thousand words will not know a single one.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh21' href='#wrh21'>Rock 21</a>The wise man cares not for fools, he makes not his friends of fools; for he who is fond of the society of fools is led down to hell.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh22' href='#wrh22'>Rock 22</a>If a fool says, “I am a fool,” he is wise in that knowledge; but the fool who thinks himself a wise man, he is called “a fool” <span class='add'>(indeed)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh23' href='#wrh23'>Rock 23</a>When the fool doth praise and when the wise man doth scorn; the scorn of the wise man is just, but improper is the praise of the fool.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh24' href='#wrh24'>Rock 24</a>He who associates with a fool is in misery, as if he were with an enemy; one ought not to associate with fools, neither ought one to listen to or see them; associating with the steadfast is happiness, like meeting again one's kinsfolk.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh25' href='#wrh25'>Rock 25</a>Therefore, as the moon keeps to the path of the constellations, so likewise keep <span class='add'>(only)</span> with them who are steadfast, erudite, who know what is best, virtuous, with the manners of the elect <i lang='san' translate='no'>(Ariyas)</i>, pre-eminent, kind, and intelligent.</p>
