<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>It is good to control the mind, which is difficult to hold, unstable, and which goes where it pleases: with a controlled mind one acquires happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>To escape from the abode of Mara one is filled with trembling, like a fish taken from its watery abode and thrown on dry land.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3' href='#wrh3'>Rock 3</a>Like one deprived of the light of the sun, one's mind wanders about; they who are truly wise hold it in, as one does an elephant with an iron hook.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh4' href='#wrh4'>Rock 4</a>It is not “do that which is of no profit to oneself, which is not worth a thought, which is of no import; but continually to control your mind”—that is what I say.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>Formerly this mind <span class='add'>(of mine)</span> ran about as it wanted, as suited its fancy; now it is orderly, and I hold it in as does the man with a hook a maddened elephant.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>Maker of the house, I have sought until now to find thee, going through the revolution of countless existences, and subject to the pain of ever-recurring birth.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>Maker of the house, having found thee out, and the great beams of the house <i lang='san' translate='no'>(kleśa)</i> being destroyed, and all the rafters <i lang='san' translate='no'>(trichnā)</i> hewn down, thou shalt not hereafter make a house <span class='add'>(for me)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>When one, having freed the mind of the sanskāra, would put an end to it <span class='add'>(birth)</span>, the mind being uncertain, changeable, flighty, and hard to control, he must straighten it by application as the fletcher straightens <span class='add'>(his arrows)</span> with fire.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>He who, thinking not of the body, lives in a cave, and wanders about all alone, does conquer this flighty mind, and is delivered of the greatest of terrors.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>He whose mind is evilly inclined will bring suffering on himself, as will not a hater by hatred, as will not an enemy to an enemy.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>He whose mind is virtuously inclined will bring happiness on himself, as cannot bring father, mother, and the other relatives.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>As into the badly-covered house pours the rain, so likewise is the unmeditative mind overwhelmed by lust.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>As into the badly-covered house pours the rain, so likewise is the unmeditative mind overwhelmed by passions.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>As into the well-covered house drops not the rain, so the meditative mind keeps out the rising passions.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>As into the badly-covered house pours the rain, so is the unmeditative mind overwhelmed by ignorance <i lang='san' translate='no'>(tamas)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>As into the well-covered house drops not the rain, so the meditative mind keeps out rising ignorance.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>As into the badly-covered house pours the rain, so is the unmeditative mind overwhelmed by selfishness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>As into the well-covered house drops not the rain, so the meditative mind keeps out rising selfishness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>As into the badly-covered house pours the rain, so is the unmeditative mind overwhelmed by affections.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh20' href='#wrh20'>Rock 20</a>As into the well-covered house drops not the rain, so the meditative mind keeps out rising affections.</p>

<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh22' href='#wrh22'>Rock 22</a>As into the well-covered house drops not the rain, so the meditative mind keeps out rising desires.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh23' href='#wrh23'>Rock 23</a>The mind is the leader of its faculties <i lang='san' translate='no'>(dharma)</i>; the mind is swift; the mind is the ruler: if one has either spoken or acted with evil intent, he will experience suffering, as he whose head was cut off by a wheel.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh24' href='#wrh24'>Rock 24</a>The mind is the leader of its faculties; the mind is swift; the mind is the ruler: if one has either spoken or acted with pure intent, he will find happiness <span class='add'>(as surely)</span> as one's shadow follows one's track.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh25' href='#wrh25'>Rock 25</a>He who is greatly given to wrangling, whose mind is sinful, though he may seek the means to do so, cannot well understand what has been well explained.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh26' href='#wrh26'>Rock 26</a>They who are angered or quarrelsome, or whose minds are without faith, cannot understand the blessed law taught by the perfect Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh27' href='#wrh27'>Rock 27</a>They who, their minds without impurity and with anger perfectly subdued, have cast off all evil-mindedness, they by this means can understand what is well explained.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh28' href='#wrh28'>Rock 28</a>He whose mind is not steadfast cannot understand the holy law; he whose faith is fickle cannot acquire perfect wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh29' href='#wrh29'>Rock 29</a>He who, given up to the indulgence of pleasure, is held in the stream of the thirty-six evil ideas, will be swept away by the flood of his passions.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh30' href='#wrh30'>Rock 30</a>Thoughts of pleasure and subjection to the senses pursue the mind, demolishing the weak man's bright lot, like birds do the fruits on a tree.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh31' href='#wrh31'>Rock 31</a>Delight not thy mind in seeking what is dazzling; keep thy mind diligent and pure, that thou mayest not for thy wicked deeds, being born in hell, have to weep on swallowing the iron ball.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh32' href='#wrh32'>Rock 32</a>He who remains seated when it is time to rise, who, though strong and young, sits slothfully at home, who is always careless in his thoughts, will not find the road to wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh33' href='#wrh33'>Rock 33</a>They who, though understanding what is trifling <span class='add'>(i.e., desires)</span>, and understanding <span class='add'>(the importance of)</span> passionlessness, have their innermost mind still disturbed, have not thorough understanding; their minds are deceived, and they wander about <span class='add'>(in the orb of transmigration)</span> again and again.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh34' href='#wrh34'>Rock 34</a>They whose memory is perfectly developed, who are diligent, who discriminate, the wise, they have understanding, and by means of their intellect they cast away every one of the errors in the interior of the mind.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh35' href='#wrh35'>Rock 35</a>He who has discerned that this body is like a vase, having by his thoughts made this <span class='add'>(idea)</span> as lasting as a citadel, fights Māra with wisdom as a weapon; and having overcome him, he wall keep to a houseless state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh36' href='#wrh36'>Rock 36</a>He who has discerned that this world is like a vase <span class='add'>(i.e., empty)</span>, having by his thoughts made this <span class='add'>(idea)</span> as lasting as a citadel, fights Māra with wisdom as a weapon; and having overcome him, he will keep to a houseless state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh37' href='#wrh37'>Rock 37</a>He who has discerned that this body is like froth, having by his thoughts made this <span class='add'>(idea)</span> as lasting as a citadel, fights Māra with wisdom as a weapon; and having overcome him, he will keep to a houseless state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh38' href='#wrh38'>Rock 38</a>He who has discerned that this world is like froth, having by his thoughts made this <span class='add'>(idea)</span> as lasting as a citadel, fights Māra with wisdom as a weapon; and having overcome him, he will keep to a houseless state.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh39' href='#wrh39'>Rock 39</a>He whose mind is devoted to meditating on the seven branches of the bodhi, who is free from all attachment <i lang='san' translate='no'>(upadana)</i>, who has cast off attachment, is cleansed of the stains of misery, and goes beyond sorrow <i lang='san' translate='no'>(parinibbuta)</i> in this world.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh40' href='#wrh40'>Rock 40</a>He who watches over his mind as does the yak over the end of its tail, is merciful to all creatures, and his happiness will not grow less <span class='add'>(in this world)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh41' href='#wrh41'>Rock 41</a>He whose mind is well composed <span class='add'>(not given to anger)</span>, delights in living alone <span class='add'>(like)</span> the largest of elephants, the elephant with goodly tusks.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh42' href='#wrh42'>Rock 42</a>He whose mind knows no harm, who is kind to all creatures <i lang='san' translate='no'>(bhuta)</i>, who is merciful to creatures, there never arises any ill feeling in him.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh43' href='#wrh43'>Rock 43</a>He who knows no evil thoughts, who is kind to all creatures, who is merciful to all living beings, there never arises any ill feeling in him.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh44' href='#wrh44'>Rock 44</a>He who knows no evil thoughts, who is kind to creatures, who shows mercy to all sentient beings, there never arises any ill feeling in him.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh45' href='#wrh45'>Rock 45</a><span class='add'>Repetition of verse 44.</span></p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh46' href='#wrh46'>Rock 46</a>He who is kind to all his acquaintances, to all his friends, and to all creatures, and who entertains a spirit of mercy, will greatly increase his happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh47' href='#wrh47'>Rock 47</a>If one has but thoughts devoid of cruelty for living beings, and shows mercy, he is by this fact virtuous; if one shows a compassionate heart to all sentient beings, he will attain such merit as is acquired by the elect <i lang='san' translate='no'>(ariya)</i>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh48' href='#wrh48'>Rock 48</a>The man who with a joyous mind, without faintheartedness, observes the laws of virtue, will arrive at perfection and happiness.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh49' href='#wrh49'>Rock 49</a>Emancipated by perfect knowledge, he is safe and at rest; his mind being at rest, the actions of his body and his words are quiet.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh50' href='#wrh50'>Rock 50</a>Thus, by having the mind fixed on one point, one obtains perfect comprehension of the law, but it is not by having cymbals on the five limbs that one will find joy.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh51' href='#wrh51'>Rock 51</a>They whose minds delight in meditation find no enjoyment in desires; he who is shielded from the smallest affliction will enjoy blissful slumber.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh52' href='#wrh52'>Rock 52</a>They whose minds delight in meditation find no enjoyment in desires; he who is troubled by no affliction whatever will find great joy.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh53' href='#wrh53'>Rock 53</a>He whose mind, like a rock, remains without being moved, who in the midst of passions is without passions, in the midst of anger is without anger, with a mind such as this it is not possible to experience suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh54' href='#wrh54'>Rock 54</a>Speak no abuse, do no harm, be firm in the observance of the Pratimoxa, know how to be moderate in your food, take up your abode in a remote forest, and you will find peace of mind in spiritual insight <i lang='san' translate='no'>(vipaśyana)</i>; this is the doctrine of the Buddha.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh55' href='#wrh55'>Rock 55</a>He who possesses a correct estimation of the mind, who appreciates the flavour of perfect solitude, protected by the earnestness of his meditative mind, he enjoys the pleasure of being without anything <span class='add'>(that causes suffering)</span>.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh56' href='#wrh56'>Rock 56</a>He whose attentive mind delights in the truth and adheres to the <span class='add'>(four)</span> truths, who always walks in the way with his body, he is safe in speech and in mind, and, casting off sorrow, he will experience no more suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh57' href='#wrh57'>Rock 57</a>He whose mind is not guarded, who is under the rule of false theories, subdued by sleep and laziness, he will fall into the power of Māra.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh58' href='#wrh58'>Rock 58</a>His mind therefore guarded, led by orthodox opinions, with perfect understanding in his way of doing, perfectly comprehending birth and decay, the Bhixu, subduing sleep and laziness, has found the way to put an end to suffering.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh59' href='#wrh59'>Rock 59</a>He who is pure is in safety; he whose mind is subdued and perfectly controlled is happy; all those who have been led astray by brutish instincts will go to hell.</p>
