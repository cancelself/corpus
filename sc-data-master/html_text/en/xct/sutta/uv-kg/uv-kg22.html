<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh1' href='#wrh1'>Rock 1</a>To listen attentively, to live righteously, to give up a home for a state of happiness, to consent to give up all, these are alike praiseworthy in a Śramana.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh2' href='#wrh2'>Rock 2</a>The fool, who knows not, behaves as if he was immortal; the wise man applies himself day and night to the holy law.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh3-4' href='#wrh3-4'>Rock 3-4</a>If a person enters into a house wrapped in darkness, though he has eyes he cannot see objects that are <span class='add'>(in it)</span>; so likewise though a man is well born and has intelligence, if he hears not the law of vice and of virtue he cannot have wisdom.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh5' href='#wrh5'>Rock 5</a>Like a man who, having eyes and who bearing also a lamp, sees all objects, is he who has heard the law of vice and of virtue; he will become perfectly wise.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh6' href='#wrh6'>Rock 6</a>They who hearken acquire knowledge of the law; they who hearken turn away from sin; they who hearken give up all evil-doers; they who hearken find nirvāṇa.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh7' href='#wrh7'>Rock 7</a>If one has heard much but observes not the moral laws <i lang='san' translate='no'>(śīla)</i>, he, because he disdains the moral laws, is not the best kind of hearer.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh8' href='#wrh8'>Rock 8</a>If one has heard little but does carefully observe the moral laws, he, because he honours the moral laws, is the best kind of hearer.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh9' href='#wrh9'>Rock 9</a>He who listens but little and he who observes not the moral laws, both of these, by reason of their disrespect fulness, lead not the best of lives.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh10' href='#wrh10'>Rock 10</a>He who has heard and he who carefully observes the moral laws, both of these, by reason of their reverence, lead the best of lives.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh11' href='#wrh11'>Rock 11</a>They who have heard much and who understand the law, who are wise and well composed, no one can scorn them, for they are like a jewel of gold of Djambudvipa.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh12' href='#wrh12'>Rock 12</a>He who describes me in his speech, having judged me <span class='add'>(only)</span> by outward appearance <span class='add'>(lit. form)</span>, that man is held by lust and does not know me.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh13' href='#wrh13'>Rock 13</a>If one has a thorough knowledge of the inner <span class='add'>(qualities of the Buddha)</span>, but has not seen the outer <span class='add'>(perfections of his person)</span>, let him, having perceived the inner fruits, be candid in his language.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh14' href='#wrh14'>Rock 14</a>If one has seen the outer <span class='add'>(perfections of the Buddha)</span>, but has not a knowledge of the inner <span class='add'>(qualities of his doctrine)</span>, let him, having perceived the apparent fruit, be candid in his language.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh15' href='#wrh15'>Rock 15</a>If one has no knowledge of the inner <span class='add'>(qualities)</span>, and has not perceived the outer <span class='add'>(perfections of my person)</span>, a fool in utter darkness, let him be candid in his language.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh16' href='#wrh16'>Rock 16</a>If one has a thorough knowledge of the inner <span class='add'>(qualities)</span>, and has seen the outer <span class='add'>(perfections)</span>, a sage who knows the way to salvation, let him be candid in his language.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh17' href='#wrh17'>Rock 17</a>Though the ear hears much and the eye sees many things, all they who do hear and see the doctrine, do not believe.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh18' href='#wrh18'>Rock 18</a>Though a man has inwardly digested the well-spoken words he has heard, and has acquired the essence of meditation, if he acts corruptly his hearing and understanding will avail him nothing.</p>
<p><a class='ref wrh' id='wrh19' href='#wrh19'>Rock 19</a>They who delight in the law taught by the elect, who follow it in body and speech, who delight in the society of the patient, who control their senses, they will obtain the reward of hearing and of understanding.</p>
