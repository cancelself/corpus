<p>The narrative introduction is Sāvatthī.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc1' href='#sc1'>SC 1</a>At that time a certain monk arising from deep meditation went to the place where the Blessed One was abiding, arrived, paid homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet and sat to one side. Sitting to one side, he addressed the Blessed One with the following words: “Venerable sir, a monk attains nirvāṇa here and now. Just in what measure is a monk declared one who attains nirvāṇa here and now? Venerable sir, how is it that a monk attains nirvāṇa here and now? Just in what measure the Well-gone One has made the declaration that a monk is one who attains nirvāṇa here and now?”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc2' href='#sc2'>SC 2</a><span class='add'>That monk</span> asked this question and the Blessed One replied with these words to that monk: “It is well, monk, it is well. Monk, you <span class='add'>now</span> ask a question like this, to what extent the declaration is made earlier of one who is said to attain nirvāṇa here and now. Monk, is this the question you ask?” “Yes, venerable sir.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a><span class='add'>The Blessed One said:</span> “Therefore, monk, listen carefully and keep in mind keep <span class='add'>it</span> in mind, and I shall explain <span class='add'>it</span>. A monk turns away from form, is free from desire <span class='add'>for it</span>, <span class='add'>proceeds towards</span> cessation, has no clinging, and abides <span class='add'>having attained</span> complete liberation of the mind from the influxes such a one can be defined a monk who attains nirvāṇa here and now. <span class='add'>A monk</span> turns away from feeling, perception, formations, consciousness, is free from desire <span class='add'>for them</span>, <span class='add'>proceeds towards</span> cessation, has no clinging, and abides <span class='add'>having attained</span> complete liberation of the mind from the influxes such a one can be defined a monk who attains nirvāṇa here and now. Monk, just in this measure a monk is declared one who attains nirvāṇa here and now. Monk, just in this measure the Well-gone One has made the declaration that a monk is one who attains nirvāṇa here and now.”</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc4' href='#sc4'>SC 4</a>Then, on hearing what the Blessed One had said, that monk was greatly delighted in his mind, and after paying homage with his head at the Buddha’s feet, he left the presence of the Blessed One.</p>
