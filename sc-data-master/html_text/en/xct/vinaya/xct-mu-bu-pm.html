<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc3' href='#sc3'>SC 3</a> It is the great leader of all holy doctrines<br>

<h2>Speech of the monk who recites the Prātimokṣasūtra.</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc17' href='#sc17'>SC 17</a> Brethren, some seasons of the year are over and some are to come. How many? So many. Brethren, since old age and death are fast approaching, and since the doctrine of the Teacher is about to perish, it behoves the community of monks to practise discipline. The Tathāgata, the Arhat attained full enlightenment. Some others too following him achieved with earnestness the blessed dharma leaning to the side of enlightenment. Our community of monks, devotees of Lord Buddha, are engaged here in petty concerns. Our acts being sordid we should consider what should be the foremost duty of our community.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc18' href='#sc18'>SC 18</a> Let us ask the approval, and enquire about the purity, of the monks who are not come. After that I should repeat the following:</p>
<blockquote class='gatha'>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc19' href='#sc19'>SC 19</a> Bowing down to Sakya Simha with folded palms<br>
you hear from me for the sake of your discipline<br>
the Prātimokṣasūtra which is recited. <a class='ref vns' id='vns18' href='#vns18'>Verse 18</a></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc20' href='#sc20'>SC 20</a> Having heard what has been said by the Great Sage,<br>
you must act according to the same,<br>
and must apply yourselves diligently<br>
to avoid the smallest transgressions. <a class='ref vns' id='vns19' href='#vns19'>Verse 19</a></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc21' href='#sc21'>SC 21</a> This Prātimokṣasūtra is indeed a bridle<br>
to the person who moves on with perpetual exertions<br>
and who striking his horselike mind with a sharp whip<br>
makes it follow the commandments fallen from the mouth of Buddha. <a class='ref vns' id='vns20' href='#vns20'>Verse 20</a></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc22' href='#sc22'>SC 22</a> Those great persons who do not turn away<br>
even by their speech from the proper course,<br>
are comparable to noble horses<br>
that gain sure victory in the war of troubles. <a class='ref vns' id='vns21' href='#vns21'>Verse 21</a></p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc23' href='#sc23'>SC 23</a> Those, to whom this is not a bridle<br>
or who do not desire it in their heart,<br>
are confounded by the war of troubles<br>
and wander away in a disconcerted state. <a class='ref vns' id='vns22' href='#vns22'>Verse 22</a></p>

<h2>Nidāna</h2>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc24' href='#sc24'>SC 24</a> Brethren, listen to me, I pray. Today is the 14th or 15th day of the lunar month for the celebration of <i>Poṣadha</i> by the community of monks. If it is convenient to the community, let us celebrate <i>Poṣadha</i> and recite the Prātimokṣasūtra. O brethren, we do perform the ceremony of <i>Poṣadha</i> and recite the Prātimokṣasūtra.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc25' href='#sc25'>SC 25</a> Whosoever among you has committed any fault, let him confess it. If there is no fault, say nothing whatsoever. If nothing is said I am to understand that the brethren are perfectly pure. As a monk gives an answer if a question is put to him separately, so each monk is to give an answer when a question is repeated three times in a community of monks like this. Whatsoever monk in such a community, thus interrogated three times, does not confess a fault of which there is recollection is guilty of uttering a deliberate lie. The uttering of a deliberate lie has, brethren, been declared by Lord Buddha be an obstacle on the way. Therefore a monk who has committed a fault and desires to be cleansed therefrom should confess it if he remembers the same. Having made confession he will reside in happiness. But if he does not confess or declare his fault, he will not be happy.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc26' href='#sc26'>SC 26</a> O brethren, I have recited the Introduction to the Prātimokṣasūtra. I now ask you whether you are perfectly pure in this matter. I ask you a second time and a third time. In this matter the brethren are perfectly pure, therefore they say nothing, so do I understand.</p>
<h2>Four Rules regarding Defeat</h2>
<p class='uddana'><a class='ref sc' id='sc27' href='#sc27'>SC 27</a> Summary:<br>
Impure conduct, theft, murder and falsehood these are the four (transgressions) regarding which rules are given here.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc28' href='#sc28'>SC 28</a> Here are, brethren, four rules regarding Defeat as known from the Prātimokṣasūtra recited each half-month.</p>
<h4>Pārājika 1</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc29' href='#sc29'>SC 29</a> Whatsoever monk, who has received the monk’s system of training and has not abandoned or injured it, indulges himself in impure intercourse down even with a brute beast, incurs Defeat and must not live in the community of monks.</p>
<h4>Pārājika 2</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc30' href='#sc30'>SC 30</a> Whatsoever monk living in a village or monastery takes a thing not given—which is counted as theft—in such a manner that a king or a minister would seize him and kill, imprison or banish him saying “You are a thief, you are stupid, you are dishonest”—the monk, who thus takes a thing not given, incurs Defeat and must not live in the community of monks.</p>
<h4>Pārājika 3</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc31' href='#sc31'>SC 31</a> Whatsoever monk deliberately takes away the life of a human being, or procures a weapon for his death, or seeks out an assassin against him, or instigates him to self-destruction or eulogises death saying, “man, what good do you get from this sinful, impure and wretched life; it is better for you to die than to live”—that is, willingly and intentionally instigates a human being to commit suicide or celebrates to him the praises of death in such a way that in consequence thereof he diesthe monk who thus causes the death of a human being incurs Defeat and must not live in the community of monks.</p>
<h4>Pārājika 4</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc32' href='#sc32'>SC 32</a> Whatsoever monk without possessing a clear and perfect knowledge speaks of himself, “I possess superhuman knowledge, I am an elect, I am a specialist, I know this, I see this, without such practice something is not known and something is not seen; and finding that transgression has arisen from such profession and being desirous of cleansing himself therefrom, the monk at another time, whether asked or unasked, speaks thus, “O brethren, when I knew not I said that I knew, when I saw not I said that I saw, it was but vain, wild and false language”—the monk who speaks in this way, except through excessive confidence, incurs Defeat and must not live in the community of monks.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc33' href='#sc33'>SC 33</a> I have, O brethren, recited the four rules regarding Defeat. If a monk has committed transgression arising from the breach of any of the rules, he incurs Defeat and must not afterwards live in the community of monks deprived as he is of their privileges.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc34' href='#sc34'>SC 34</a> In this respect I ask, “O brethren, are you perfectly pure?” A second time and a third time I ask, “O brethren, are you perfectly pure?” In this respect the brethren are perfectly pure, therefore they say nothing, so do I understand.</p>
<h2>Thirteen Rules regarding Suspension from Monkhood</h2>
<p class='uddana'><a class='ref sc' id='sc35' href='#sc35'>SC 35</a> Summary:<br>
Emission of semen, contact, discourse, bodily service, intermediation, house, monastery, groundless, a mere trifle, causing dissension, siding, corrupting family, and harsh speech.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc36' href='#sc36'>SC 36</a> Here are, brethren, thirteen rules regarding Suspension from monkhood as known from the Prātimokṣasūtra recited each half-month.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 1</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc37' href='#sc37'>SC 37</a> A conscious emission of semen, except in a dream, is a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 2</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc38' href='#sc38'>SC 38</a> Whatsoever monk comes, with a perverted mind, into bodily contact with a woman or takes hold of her hand or shoulder or braid of hair, or touches any other parts of her body for enjoyment, commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 3</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc39' href='#sc39'>SC 39</a> Whatsoever monk holds, with a perverted mind, a vicious discourse with a woman regarding sexual intercourse, such as a youth would hold with a damsel, commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 4</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc40' href='#sc40'>SC 40</a> Whatsoever monk, in order to secure the bodily service of a woman to himself, says, with a perverted mind, in her presence, that “the service rendered by one’s own body, through an act of intercourse, to a monk of such character, conduct, and purity as myself, is the best of all services”—(he) extolling the woman’s bodilv service, commits a transgression which causes suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 5</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc41' href='#sc41'>SC 41</a> Whatsoever monk by conveying the words of a man to woman or those of a woman to a man acts as an intermediary for a wife, a paramour or even for a harlot, commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 6</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc42' href='#sc42'>SC 42</a> If a monk bringing materials together causes a house to be built up for himself, independent of a layman, he must take care to observe the proper measurements. And herein this is the measurement: the house inside must be twelve of Buddha’s spans in length and seven of those spans in breadth. For the inspection of the site he must bring a community of monks who should see that the site is suitable, is not exposed to danger and is easy of access If the monk, in spite of the site being unsuitable or exposed to danger or not being easy of access, brings materials on his own account and causes a house to be built up for himself independent of a layman without taking the community of monks for the inspection or without showing them the site and also deviating from the proper measurements—(he) commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 7</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc43' href='#sc43'>SC 43</a> If a monk seeks to build for monks a large monastery in which there shall be a resident layman, he must bring for the inspection of the site a community of monks who ought to see that the site is suitable, is not exposed to danger and is easy of access. If the monk, in spite of the site being unsuitable, exposed to danger and not being easy of access, builds for monks the monastery in which there shall be a resident layman, without bringing the community of monks for the inspection or without showing them the site—(he) commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 8</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc44' href='#sc44'>SC 44</a> Whatsoever monk being angry prefers, out of malice, against an innocent monk the charge of Defeat, which is groundless, thinking “I may thus remove him anyhow from the course of purity”; and then at another time being asked or unasked says that the charge is groundless and that it was preferred out of malice—(he) commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 9</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc45' href='#sc45'>SC 45</a> If a monk being angry prefers, out of malice, against an innocent monk a charge of Defeat which is unreal but accords with apart of another dispute, thinking “I may thus remove him anyhow from the course of purity”; and then at another time being asked or unasked says that the charge is unreal and that it was brought on account of its having accorded with a part of another dispute, the monk who out of malice and through imagination alone prefers the charge based thus on a mere trifle commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 10</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc46' href='#sc46'>SC 46</a> Whatsoever monk endeavours to cause dissension in a community of monks that is in harmony or persists in emphasising the points calculated to cause dissension, should be addressed by other monks thus: “O brother, do not endeavour to cause dissension in the community of monks that is in harmony, do not persist in emphasising the points calculated to cause dissension, live in harmony with the community of monks, the community being in harmony there will be no innovations and they being in peace there will be no disputation: combining with one another, as milk combines with water, they do brighten the doctrine of Buddha and live in happiness. Brother, you abandon your expedients to cause dissension in the community of monks.” If the monk being thus addressed by other monks abandons his expedients it is well. But if he abandons them not, he should be admonished a second time and a third time. Being thus formally admonished if he gives up his expedients, it is well; but if he does not, he commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 11</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc47' href='#sc47'>SC 47</a> If certain monks—one, two or more—do, out of friendship, side with a monk who speaks out dissension, and address a community of monks thus: “O brethren, do not say anything good or bad to this dissentient monk. Why so? Because, brethren, the monk speaks according to the law, he speaks according to the precepts, receiving well the law and precepts he holds them carefully and observes them, and he speaks with knowledge and not without it. Since he speaks only when he is so desired, it is our desire that he should speak.” Then the community of monks should answer the monks thus: “Say not, sirs, that the dissentient monk speaks according to the law; that he speaks according to the precepts; that he receiving well the law and precepts, holds them carefully and observes them; that he speaks with knowledge and not without it and that since he speaks only when he is so desired, it is our desire that he should speak.” Why so? “O sirs, this dissentient monk speaks not according to the law, he speaks not according to the precepts, he has not received well the law and precepts to hold them carefully or observe them. He speaks without knowledge and not with it. Since he speaks only when he is so desired, do not, sirs, desire him to speak. Do not, sirs, desire that there should be dissension in the community of monks: on the contrary desire, sirs, that there should be harmony in the community. The community of monks being in harmony there will be no innovations, they being in peace there will be no disputation: combining with one another, as milk combines with water, they do brighten the doctrine of Buddha and live in happiness. Do not, sirs, side with this monk who speaks out dissension in the community.” If the monks being thus answered by the community abandon their course, it is well. If they abandon it not, they should be formally admonished a second time and a third time. Being thus formally admonished if they abandon their course it is well. But if they abandon it not they commit a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 12</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc48' href='#sc48'>SC 48</a> If many monks dwelling near a village or a town corrupt familes and perpetrate evil deeds and the families corrupted by them are seen, heard and known, and the evil deeds perpetrated are also seen, heard and known, those monks should be addressed by a community of monks thus: “O brethren, you are corrupters of families and perpetrators of evil deeds; the families corrupted by you are seen, heard and known; and your evil deeds too are seen, heard and known: brethren, you have dwelt here long enough, go away now from this place.” Being so addressed if they should answer the community of monks thus: “O brethren, some of you here are walking in lust, some in malice, some in delusion and some in fear; and for a fault of a like nature you do remove some monks while others you do not remove”—the community should in return answer thus: “O brethren, do not say that some of us walk in lust, some in malice, some in delusion and some in fear; and for a fault of a like nature we remove some monks while others we do not remove. Why so? We monks do not walk in lust, we do not walk in malice, we do not walk in delusion and we do not walk in fear. Brethren, you are corrupters of families and perpetrators of evil deeds; and you yourselves have seen, heard and known the corrupters of families and perpetrators of evil deeds: give up your talk that we monks walk in lust, in malice, in delusion and in fear.” If those monks being thus addressed by the community of monks abandon their evil course it is well. But if they abandon it not, they should be formally admonished a second time and a third time. If they then abandon their evil course, it is well; but if they do not, they commit a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<h4>Saṅghādhiśeṣa 13</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc49' href='#sc49'>SC 49</a> If a monk of harsh speech, when spoken to by a community of monks about matters of training in accordance with the law and precepts delivered by Buddha, says: “Brethren, do not say anything, good or bad, to me; I too shall say nothing, good or bad, to you; brethren, refrain from speaking to me, I too shall refrain from speaking to you. There is in fact nothing to be spoken about”—he should be addressed by the community of monks thus: “O brother, when you are spoken to by the community of monks about matters of training in accordance with the law and precepts delivered by Buddha, do not make yourself a person who cannot be spoken to, make yourself rather a person to whom we can speak. brother, when the monks speak to you in accordance with the law and precepts, you too should speak to them in accordance with the same. By mutual conversation and mutual instruction you do save one another from falling into transgression. Thus grows up the monkhood established by our fully Enlightened Lord, the Blessed Tathāgata, the Vanquisher of enemies. Brother, abandon your resolution of not being spoken to.” If the monk thus addressed by the community of monks abandons his resolution, it is good. But if he does not, he should be formally admonished a second time and a third time. If he then abandons his resolution, it is good; but if he does not, he commits a transgression which causes Suspension from monkhood.</p>
<hr>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc50' href='#sc50'>SC 50</a> Brethren, I have recited the thirteen rules regarding transgressions which cause Suspension from monkhood. Of these the first nine become transgressions at once, while the remaining four do not become transgressions until the end of the third admonition. If a monk commits any of these transgressions, he must, even against his wish, live in a separate residence for as many days as he knowingly concealed his transgressions. After this has been done he must, for six further days, cultivate reverence for monkhood. Thereupon He should, while acting according to the law, be reinstated in some place where there is a community of at least twenty monks. If the community being a body of less than twenty, even by one, should reinstate that monk he is not reinstated and that community deserves censure. This is the prescribed course in the matter.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc51' href='#sc51'>SC 51</a> In this respect I ask, “O brethren, are you perfectly pure?” A second time and a third time I ask, “O brethren, are you perfectly pure?” In this respect the brethren are perfectly pure, therefore they say nothing, so do I understand.</p>
<h2>Two Rules regarding Undetermined Matters</h2>
<p class='uddana'>Summary:<br>
Sitting in a solitary protected place.</p>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc52' href='#sc52'>SC 52</a> Here are, O brethren, two rules regarding Undetermined Matters as known from the Prātimokṣasūtra recited each half-month.</p>
<h4>Aniyata 1</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc53' href='#sc53'>SC 53</a> If a monk sits together with a woman in a solitary protected place sultable for tlie carrying out of lustful desires; and if a female devotee of undoubted veracity charges him with one or other of the three offences, viz., that which causes Defeat or Suspension or requires Expiation, then the monk, if he acknowledges that he so sat, should be held guilty of the offence which he has committed or with which he has been charged. This is an Undetermined Matter.</p>
<h4>Aniyata 2</h4>
<p><a class='ref sc' id='sc54' href='#sc54'>SC 54</a> If a monk sits together with a woman in a solitary protected place, which is however not suitable for the carrying out of lustful desires; and if a female devotee of undoubted veracity charges him with one or other of the two offences, viz., that which causes Suspension or requires Expiation, then the monk, if he acknowledges that he so sat, should be held guilty of the offence which he has committed or with which he has been charged. This is an Undetermined Matter.</p>

With this price of a set of robes may you purchase such and such a set of robes and clothe with the same the monk of such and such a name when he arrives.” Having spoken everything elegantly and shown everything accurately, the messenger should approach the monk and address him thus: “O sir, I have given a clear instruction to the agent pointed out, that when your reverence arrives there, he will clothe you with the set of robes at that time.’ The monk desirous of getting the set should then go to the agent and tell him: “O friend, I want a set of robes.” The agent should thus be persuaded twice or three times and he should be reminded of the set of robes. If by persuading and reminding the agent twice or three times he succeeds in getting the set of robes, it is well. If he does not succeed in getting it, let then the monk go to the agent the fourth, fifth or sixth time and wait without speaking a word. If while silently waiting up to the fifth or sixth time, he succeeds in getting the set, it is well. But if waiting even up to the sixth time he does not succeed in getting the set, and then exerts himself beyond the sixth time and succeeds in getting it, he commits a transgression which involves Forfeiture.</p>
